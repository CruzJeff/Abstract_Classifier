"Keratinocytes release several factors that are involved in wound contracture and scar formation. We previously reported that a three-dimensional reconstruction model derived from rat skin represents a good wound healing model.We characterized the role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the release of transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1 from keratinocytes and the differentiation of fibroblasts to identify possible promising pharmacological approaches to prevent scar formation and contractures.The three-dimensional culture model was made from rat keratinocytes seeded on a collagen gel in which dermal fibroblasts had been embedded.Among the TRP channel inhibitors tested, the TRPV2 inhibitors SKF96365 and tranilast attenuated most potently keratinocyte-dependent and - independent collagen gel contraction due to TGF-? signaling as well as TGF-?1 release from keratinocytes and ?-smooth muscle actin production in myofibroblasts. Besides the low amounts detected in normal dermis, TRPV2 mRNA and protein levels were increased after fibroblasts were embedded in the gel. TRPV2 was also expressed in the epidermis and keratinocyte layers of the model. Both inhibitors and TRPV2 siRNA attenuated the intracellular increase of Ca2+induced by the TRPV agonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate in TGF-?1-pretreated fibroblasts.This is the first study to show that compounds targeting TRPV2 channels ameliorate wound contraction through the inhibition of TGF-?1 release and the differentiation of dermal fibroblasts in a culture model."
The complex biochemistry and dynamic structure of mitochondria have prevented them from being prominent pharmacological targets. New mechanistic understanding of cholesterol transport and associated neurosteroidogenesis is providing evidence on therapeutic outcomes in mental disorders that is achievable via mitochondrial pharmacology. This warrants general attention on mitochondrial pharmacology to inform therapies.
Findings from mice that had their Smn gene deleted and some copies of the human SMN2 gene introduced to produce SMN protein are summarized. Symptoms due to this manipulation can be corrected only by restoring the SMN protein expression in neurones and not in muscle. The changes in muscle and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in these mutant mice are probably due to the malfunction of the neuronal component of the NMJ i.e. the nerve terminal. The reduction of transmitter release by nerve terminals in animals with reduced SMN protein supports this notion. There is a critical period during which the presence of the SMN protein is mandatory for the survival of the motor unit and the individual. This period coincides with the most important events involved in the development of the motor unit. Results from normal genetically unaffected rats and mice show that during a critical period of development the function of the nerve terminal and the release of transmitter play a crucial role in the development of the motor neurone and muscle. The possibility that targeting the function of the nerve terminal to overcome its inability to release transmitter could benefit patients with the deletion of the SMN gene.
"Association analyses between blood pressure (BP) and serum sodium and potassium for 14,657 men and 16,977 women between ages 12 and 85 years show that responses of BP to serum sodium and potassium are age and gender dependent. The data were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2003 and 2014. Associations between serum sodium and BP are positive only for advanced age groups and for serum sodium level greater than 139-140 mmol/L in less advanced groups. These positive associations can be explained by traditional renal-centered mechanism. Inverse associations between systolic BP and serum sodium exist when sodium is less than ?140 mmol/L in less advanced age groups (<60 for men and <70 for women). These inverse associations can partially be explained by the extrarenal regulatory mechanism in which sodium storage in negatively charged glycosaminoglycans in the interstitium may be involved. Associations of high serum potassium and low BP are consistent and exist in most age groups. Effect of potassium on systolic BP and diastolic BP are more prominent in less advanced age groups. Age-dependent associations between sodium and BP support the theory that sodium homeostasis in the body may not be regulated by renal-centered responses alone. There might be regulation of an extrarenal system in which sodium attraction by negatively charged glycosaminoglycans plays a role."
"A series of natural products-based phenyl sulfone derivative and their property-based analogues were investigated as potential growth inhibitors of Trypanosoma brucei. Trypanosoma brucei is a kinetoplastid protozoan parasite that causes trypanosomiasis. In this work, we found that nopol- and quinoline-based phenyl sulfone derivative were the most active and selective for T. brucei, and they were not reactive towards the active thiol of T. brucei's cysteine protease rhodesain. A thiol reactive variant of the quinoline-based phenyl sulfone was subsequently investigated and found to be a moderate inhibitor of rhodesain. The quinoline-based compound that is not reactive towards rhodesain can serve a template for phenotypic-based lead discovery while its thiol-active congener can serve as template for structure-based investigation of new antitrypanosomal agents."
"Acuity, the fineness with which sensory systems perceive and parse information, limits the information that organisms can extract from stimuli. Here, we focus on visual acuity (the ability to perceive static spatial detail) to discuss relationships between acuity and signal form and evolution. Research suggests that acuity varies by orders of magnitude across species, and that most animals have much lower acuity than humans. Thus, hypotheses regarding the function of spatial patterns must account for the acuity of relevant viewers. New data quantifying acuity in a range of taxa allow us to examine correlations between acuity and ecology, elucidate the selective forces that receiver acuity places on signal evolution, and examine how signals might appear to viewers with different acuities."
"The accuracy of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) to stage prostate cancer (PCa) is limited. However, Gleason 8-10 PCa and more aggressive metastatic PCa have been shown to exhibit a higher glycolytic activity.To evaluate the potential of intraprostatic FDG uptake to prognose Gleason 8-10 PCa patients prior to prostatectomy, based on tumour intrinsic biology.FDG-PET/CT and a bone scan were performed as a staging procedure prior to prostatectomy in 148 consecutive patients diagnosed with PCa with a Gleason sum of ?8 at biopsy.The FDG-PET/CT images were blind reviewed. Lymph node (LN) metastasis and intraprostatic FDG uptake were systematically recorded, and correlated with the patients' clinicopathological characteristics.FDG-PET/CT detected foci of intraprostatic FDG uptake in 66% of patients. An intraprostatic FDG uptake of maximum intraprostatic standardised uptake value (SUVmax) of ?4.6 was statistically significantly associated with a higher pathological Gleason ?8, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and pathological LN metastasis. In multivariate analysis, an intraprostatic SUVmax of ?4.6 was associated with a two-fold increased risk of biochemical recurrence in the year following surgery. Patients with an intraprostatic SUVmax of ?4.6 had estimated median biochemical recurrence-free survival (BFS) of 11.3mo compared with 49.5mo for those with a lower SUVmax. Finally, high intraprostatic FDG uptake was associated with shorter time to castration resistance following radical prostatectomy (RP).Preoperative intraprostatic FDG uptake is an integrator of adverse pathological prognostic factors, predicting BFS and castration resistance following RP in patients with a Gleason score ?8 PCa at biopsy. These results support the use of preoperative FDG-PET/CT as a tool to distinguish at diagnosis very high-risk Gleason 8-10 PCa patients in whom novel neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies should be explored.This study shows that an increased use of glucose by prostate cancer cells detected by18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography molecular imaging can identify aggressive prostate cancers."
"Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells with an intrinsic ability to detect and kill infected and cancerous cells. The success of therapies targeting immune checkpoints on CD8 cells has intensified interest in harnessing the cytolytic effector functions of NK cells for new cancer treatments. NK cell development, survival and effector activity is dependent on exposure to the cytokine interleukin (IL)-15. The suppressor of cytokine (SOCS) proteins (CIS; SOCS1-7) are important negative regulators of cytokine signaling, and both CIS and SOCS2 are reported to have roles in regulating NK cell responses. Their immunomodulatory effects on NK cells suggest that these SOCS proteins are promising targets that can potentially form the basis of novel cancer therapies. Here we discuss the role of NK cells in tumor immunity as well as review the role of the SOCS proteins in regulating IL-15 signaling and NK cell function."
"We synthesized Ni2+-attached O-Carboxymethyl chitosan Schiff base complexes embedded composite cryogels (Ni2+-O-CMCS-CCs) by means of polymerization of gel-forming precursors at subzero temperatures. Prepared affinity cryogel showed excellent adsorption performance for lysozyme selected as model protein to test adsorption parameters, demonstrating an adsorption capacity of 244.6?mg/g (15.3?mg/g for Ni2+minus O-CMCS-CCs), with fast adsorption equilibrium within 30?min and good reversibility. The performance of Ni2+-O-CMCS-CCs for lysozyme was also evaluated by SDS-PAGE, and a purification efficiency of 86.9% with 89.5% purification yield was determined. The swelling test, FT-IR, and SEM analysis were carried out for the characterization of Ni2+-O-CMCS-CCs. At the end of 35 adsorption-desorption cycles, there was no significant change in the adsorption capacity."
"In budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PtdIns(4)P serves as an essential signalling molecule in the Golgi complex, endosomal system, and plasma membrane, where it is involved in the control of multiple cellular functions via direct interactions with PtdIns(4)P-binding proteins. To analyse the distribution of PtdIns(4)P in yeast cells at a nanoscale level, we employed an electron microscopy technique that specifically labels PtdIns(4)P on the freeze-fracture replica of the yeast membrane. This method minimizes the possibility of artificial perturbation, because molecules in the membrane are physically immobilised in situ. We observed that PtdIns(4)P is localised on the cytoplasmic leaflet, but not the exoplasmic leaflet, of the plasma membrane, Golgi body, vacuole, and vesicular structure membranes. PtdIns(4)P labelling was not observed in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, and in the outer and inner membranes of the nuclear envelope or mitochondria. PtdIns(4)P forms clusters of <100?nm in diameter in the plasma membrane and vacuolar membrane according to point pattern analysis of immunogold labelling. There are three kinds of compartments in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. In the present study, we showed that PtdIns(4)P is specifically localised in the flat undifferentiated plasma membrane compartment. In the vacuolar membrane, PtdIns(4)P was concentrated in intramembrane particle (IMP)-deficient raft-like domains, which are tightly bound to lipid droplets, but not surrounding IMP-rich non-raft domains in geometrical IMP-distributed patterns in the stationary phase. This is the first report showing microdomain formations of PtdIns(4)P in the plasma membrane and vacuolar membrane of budding yeast cells at a nanoscale level, which will illuminate the functionality of PtdIns(4)P in each membrane."
"Patients presenting with abnormally high numbers of immature oocytes at retrieval are more likely to exhibit maturation resistant oocytes. However, the clinical relevance of such events remains unknown. We investigated nuclear maturation competence of immature oocytes from patients showing >40% of collected immature oocytes (Study group) and Controls, in which a normal number of mature oocytes (?60%) was retrieved. Following in-vitro culture, oocytes were classified as maturation resistant or in-vitro matured (IVM). Treatment outcomes were evaluated in Study and Control groups based on presence of maturation resistant oocytes. Overall, similarly high spindle and chromosome abnormality rates were observed in maturation resistant oocytes from both Study and Control groups. IVM oocytes from the Study group revealed significantly higher percentages of misaligned chromosomes compared with Controls (P < 0.05). Remarkably, Study group patients with at least one maturation resistant oocyte showed significantly reduced cumulative pregnancy and live birth rates compared with Control group maturation resistant patients (P < 0.05). When further investigating the aetiology, a maturation resistant mouse model revealed defective Ca2+signalling of maturation resistant oocytes at germinal vesicular breakdown and parthenogenetic activation. In conclusion, appropriate treatment strategies, including clinical utilization of IVM oocytes from Study group patients, warrant further investigation."
"VEGF secreted from retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is responsible for the choroidal vascular development; however, the molecular regulatory mechanism is unclear. We found thatAldh1a1-/-mice showed choroidal hypoplasia with insufficient vascularization in the dorsal region, although Aldh1a1, an enzyme that synthesizes retinoic acids (RAs), is expressed in the dorsal neural retina, not in the RPE/choroid complex. The level of VEGF in the RPE/choroid was significantly decreased inAldh1a1-/-mice, and RA-dependent enhancement of VEGF was observed in primary RPE cells. An RA-deficient diet resulted in dorsal choroidal hypoplasia, and simple RA treatment ofAldh1a1-/-pregnant females suppressed choroid hypoplasia in their offspring. We also found downregulation of Sox9 in the dorsal neural retina and RPE ofAldh1a1-/-mice and RPE-specific disruption of Sox9 phenocopiedAldh1a1-/-choroidal development. These results suggest that RAs produced by Aldh1a1 in the neural retina directs dorsal choroidal vascular development via Sox9 upregulation in the dorsal RPE cells to enhance RPE-derived VEGF secretion."
"Sexual parasites offer unique insights into the reproduction of unisexual and sexual populations. Because unisexuality is almost exclusively linked to the female sex, most studies addressed host-parasite dynamics in populations where sperm-dependent females dominate. Pelophylax water frogs from Central Europe include hybrids of both sexes, collectively named P. esculentus. They live syntopically with their parental species P. lessonae and/or P. ridibundus. Some hybrid lineages consist of all males providing a chance to understand the origin and perpetuation of a host-parasite (egg-dependent) system compared to sperm-dependent parthenogenesis.We focused on P. ridibundus-P. esculentus populations where P. ridibundus of both sexes lives together with only diploid P. esculentus males. Based on 17 microsatellite markers and six allozyme loci, we analyzed (i) the variability of individual genomes, (ii) the reproductive mode(s) of all-male hybrids, and (iii) the genealogical relationships between the hybrid and parental genomes.Our microsatellite data revealed that P. esculentus males bear Mendelian-inherited ridibundus genomes while the lessonae genome represents a single clone. Our data indicate that this clone did not recently originate from adjacent P. lessonae populations, suggesting an older in situ or ex situ origin.Our results confirm that also males can perpetuate over many generations as the unisexual lineage and successfully compete with P. ridibundus males for eggs provided by P. ridibundus females. Natural persistence of such sex-specific hybrid populations allows to studying the similarities and differences between male and female reproductive parasitism in many biological settings."
"Antibiotic resistance is a defense mechanism, harbored by pathogens to survive under unfavorable conditions. Among several antibiotic resistant microbial consortium, Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most havoc microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus encodes a unique enzyme 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (SaHPPK), against which, none of existing antibiotics have been reported.Computational approaches have been instrumental in designing and discovering new drugs for several diseases. The present study highlights the impact of ginger phytochemicals on Staphylococcus aureus SaHPPK. Herein, we have retrieved eight ginger phytochemicals from published literature and investigated their inhibitory interactions with SaHPPK. To authenticate our work, the investigation proceeds considering the known antibiotics alongside the phytochemicals. Molecular docking was performed employing GOLD and CDOCKER. The compounds with the highest dock score from both the docking programmes were tested for their inhibitory capability in vitro. The binding conformations that were seated within the binding pocket showing strong interactions with the active sites residues rendered by highest dock score were forwarded towards the molecular dynamic (MD) simulation analysis.Based on molecular dock scores, molecular interaction with catalytic active residues and MD simulations studies, two ginger phytochemicals, gingerenone-A and shogaol have been proposed as candidate inhibitors against Staphylococcus aureus. They have demonstrated higher dock scores than the known antibiotics and have represented interactions with the key residues within the active site. Furthermore, these compounds have rendered considerable inhibitory activity when tested in vitro. Additionally, their superiority was corroborated by stable MD results conducted for 100 ns employing GROMACS package.Finally, we suggest that gingerenone-A and shogaol may either be potential SaHPPK inhibitors or can be used as fundamental platforms for novel SaHPPK inhibitor development."
"The native pre-fusion structure of gp120/gp41 complex of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 was recently revealed. In the model, the helices of gp41 (?6, ?7, ?8, and ?9) form a four-helix collar underneath trimeric gp120. Gp41 is a class I fusion protein and mediates membrane fusion by forming a post-fusion structure called the six-helix bundle (6HB). The comparison of the pre- and post-fusion structures revealed the large conformational changes in gp41 during the antiparallel packing of the N- and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHRs and CHRs) in membrane fusion. Several mutagenesis studies of gp41 performed in the past were interpreted based on 6HB, the only available structure at that time. To obtain an insight about the current pre-fusion structural model and conformational changes during membrane fusion, alanine insertion mutagenesis of the NHR, CHR and connecting loop regions of HXB2 gp41 was performed. The effects of mutations on biosynthesis and membrane fusion were analyzed by immunoblotting and fusion assays, respectively. The extent of membrane fusion was evaluated by split luciferase-based pore formation and syncytia formation assays, respectively.Consistent with the current structural model, drastic negative effects of mutations on biosynthesis and membrane fusion were observed for NHR, loop, and proximal regions of CHR (up to amino acid position 643). The insertions in ?9 after it leaves the four-helix collar were tolerable for biosynthesis. These CHR mutants showed varying effects on membrane fusion. Insertion at position 644 or 645 resulted in poor pore and syncytia formation. Efficient pore and syncytia formation almost similar to that of the wild type was observed for insertion at position 647, 648 or 649. However, recovery of virus infectivity was only observed for the insertions beyond position 648.The mutagenesis data for HXB2 gp41 is in agreement with the recent pre-fusion structure model. The virus infection data suggested that fusion pores sufficiently large enough for the release of the virus genome complex are formed after the completion of 6HB beyond position 648."
"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Bihar State (India) continues to be endemic, despite the existence of effective treatment and a vector control program to control disease morbidity. A clear understanding of spatio-temporal distribution of VL may improve surveillance and control implementation. This study explored the trends in spatio-temporal dynamics of VL endemicity at a meso-scale level in Vaishali District, based on geographical information systems (GIS) tools and spatial statistical analysis.A GIS database was used to integrate the VL case data from the study area between 2009 and 2014. All cases were spatially linked at a meso-scale level. Geospatial techniques, such as GIS-layer overlaying and mapping, were employed to visualize and detect the spatio-temporal patterns of a VL endemic outbreak across the district. The spatial statistic Moran's I Index (Moran's I) was used to simultaneously evaluate spatial-correlation between endemic villages and the spatial distribution patterns based on both the village location and the case incidence rate (CIR). Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard error, confidence intervals and percentages were used to summarize the VL case data.There were 624 endemic villages with 2719 (average 906 cases/year) VL cases during 2012-2014. The Moran's I revealed a cluster pattern (P?<?0.05) of CIR distribution at the meso-scale level. On average, 68 villages were newly-endemic each year. Of which 93.1% of villages' endemicity were found to have occurred on the peripheries of the previous year endemic villages. The mean CIR of the endemic villages that were peripheral to the following year newly-endemic villages, compared to all endemic villages of the same year, was higher (P?<?0.05).The results show that the VL endemicity of new villages tends to occur on the periphery of villages endemic in the previous year. High-CIR plays a major role in the spatial dispersion of the VL cases between non-endemic and endemic villages. This information can help achieve VL elimination throughout the Indian subcontinent by improving vector control design and implementation in highly-endemic district."
"The genetic polymorphism (rs16969968 in CHRNA5, and rs1051730 in CHRNA3 genes) were recently shown to be associated with risk of LC. The aim of this study is to elucidate whether they predispose Palestinian individuals to lung cancer, and how is this related to smoking.Frequency of the rs16969968-A allele was significantly higher in the case group (36.7%) than in normal controls (17.5%; P?=?0.022; OR?=?6.83 for AA and 2.81 for AG genotypes). The frequency of rs1051730-T allele was also significantly higher in the case group (46.7%) than in the control group (22.5%; P?=?0.001; OR?=?2.20 for TC and 13.22 for TT genotypes). Frequency of rs16969968-A allele was higher in smokers (29.1%) than nonsmokers (15.7%) regardless of lung cancer; similarly, frequency of rs1051730-T allele was also higher in smokers than in smokers (46.7% vs 22.5%, respectively). The higher the proportion of the risk allele (rs16969968-A and rs1051730-T), the higher the mean number of daily consumed cigarettes (P?=?0.006). Carrying rs16969968-A and/or rs1051730-T alleles results in an increased risk to lung cancer probably by increasing the individual's tendency for heavy smoking. The allelic frequency of the rs16969968-A and rs1051730-T alleles among normal Palestinian controls is similar to different populations worldwide."
"During Drosophila spermatogenesis, testis-specific meiotic arrest complex (tMAC) and testis-specific TBP-associated factors (tTAF) contribute to activation of hundreds of genes required for meiosis and spermiogenesis. Intriguingly, tMAC is paralogous to the broadly expressed complex Myb-MuvB (MMB)/dREAM and Mip40 protein is shared by both complexes. tMAC acts as a gene activator in spermatocytes, while MMB/dREAM was shown to repress gene activity in many cell types.Our study addresses the intricate interplay between tMAC, tTAF, and MMB/dREAM during spermatogenesis. We used cell type-specific DamID to build the DNA-binding profiles of Cookie monster (tMAC), Cannonball (tTAF), and Mip40 (MMB/dREAM and tMAC) proteins in male germline cells. Incorporating the whole transcriptome analysis, we characterized the regulatory effects of these proteins and identified their gene targets. This analysis revealed that tTAFs complex is involved in activation of achi, vis, and topi meiosis arrest genes, implying that tTAFs may indirectly contribute to the regulation of Achi, Vis, and Topi targets. To understand the relationship between tMAC and MMB/dREAM, we performed Mip40 DamID in tTAF- and tMAC-deficient mutants demonstrating meiosis arrest phenotype. DamID profiles of Mip40 were highly dynamic across the stages of spermatogenesis and demonstrated a strong dependence on tMAC in spermatocytes. Integrative analysis of our data indicated that MMB/dREAM represses genes that are not expressed in spermatogenesis, whereas tMAC recruits Mip40 for subsequent gene activation in spermatocytes.Discovered interdependencies allow to formulate a renewed model for tMAC and tTAFs action in Drosophila spermatogenesis demonstrating how tissue-specific genes are regulated."
"Apical periodontitis includes periapical granulomas and radicular cysts, which are histologically distinguished by the absence and the presence of an epithelial lining, respectively. The main cause of apical periodontitis is the bacterial colonization of the root canal space. This research aimed at assessing whether and how periapical granulomas and radicular cysts differ in terms of microbiota using high throughput amplicon target sequencing (HTS) techniques.This study included 5 cases of Periapical Granulomas (PGs) and 5 cases of Radicular Cysts (RCs) selected on the base of histology out of 37 patients from January 2015 to February 2016. Complete medical history, panoramic radiograms (OPTs) and histologic records of each patient were assessed. Only lesions greater than 1 cm in diameter and developed in proximity to teeth with bad prognosis were included. The microbiota present in periapical granulomas and radicular cysts thus retrieved was finely characterized by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA genes.The core of OTUs shared between periapical granulomas and radicular cysts was dominated by the presence of facultative anaerobes taxa such as: Lactococcus lactis, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus warneri, Acinetobacter johnsonii and Gemellales. L. lactis, the main OTUs of the entire datasets, was associated with periapical granuloma samples. Consistently with literature, the anaerobic taxa detected were most abundant in radicular cyst samples. Indeed, a higher abundance of presumptive predicted metabolic pathways related to Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was found in radicular cyst samples.The present pilot study confirmed the different microbial characterization of the two main apical periodontitis types and shade light on the possible role of L. lactis in periapical granulomas."
"For patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC), second-line chemotherapy regimen remains controversial. The efficacy and safety of irinotecan-containing doublet treatment and irinotecan monotherapy were compared in this systematic analysis.A search was conducted on EMBASE and Medline databases. All articles compared irinotecan-containing doublet to irinotecan as second-line chemotherapy for AGC. STATA statistical software (Version 12.0) was used to analyze the data.Seven studies, including 905 cases, were included in the analysis. Irinotecan-containing doublet treatment significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared to irinotecan monotherapy (HR?=?0.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.95). However, doublet treatment neither significantly prolong overall survival compared to monotherapy (HR?=?0.94, 95% CI: 0.81-1.10), nor did it significantly increase the overall response rates and disease control rates, when compared to monotherapy. In addition, the irinotecan-containing doublet group had an increase in incidences of ? Grade 3 neutropenia (RR?=?1.23, 95% CI: 1.01-1.51) and anemia (RR?=?2.00, 95% CI: 1.37-2.92).When compared to irinotecan monotherapy, irinotecan-containing doublet treatment increased progression free survival and was tolerable as a second- line chemotherapy for AGC."
"Domestication of animals leads to large phenotypic alterations within a short evolutionary time-period. Such alterations are caused by genomic variations, yet the prevalence of modified traits is higher than expected if they were caused only by classical genetics and mutations. Epigenetic mechanisms may also be important in driving domesticated phenotypes such as behavior traits. Gene expression can be modulated epigenetically by mechanisms such as DNA methylation, resulting in modifications that are not only variable and susceptible to environmental stimuli, but also sometimes transgenerationally stable. To study such mechanisms in early domestication, we used as model two selected lines of red junglefowl (ancestors of modern chickens) that were bred for either high or low fear of humans over five generations, and investigated differences in hypothalamic DNA methylation between the two populations.Twenty-two 1-kb windows were differentially methylated between the two selected lines at p?<?0.05 after false discovery rate correction. The annotated functions of the genes within these windows indicated epigenetic regulation of metabolic and signaling pathways, which agrees with the changes in gene expression that were previously reported for the same tissue and animals.Our results show that selection for an important domestication-related behavioral trait such as tameness can cause divergent epigenetic patterns within only five generations, and that these changes could have an important role in chicken domestication."
"Cervical cancer is a major cause of cancer-related mortality in women in the developing world. Cancer Stem cells (CSC) have been implicated in treatment resistance and metastases development; hence understanding their significance is important.Primary culture from tissue biopsies of invasive cervical cancer and serial passaging was performed for establishing cell lines. Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) assay was performed for comparison of cell lines with their parental tissue. Tumorsphere and Aldefluor assays enabled isolation of cancer stem cells (CSC); immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were performed for their surface phenotypic expression in cell lines and in 28 tissue samples. Quantitative real-time PCR for stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, MTT cytotoxicity assay, cell cycle analysis and cell kinetic studies were performed.Four low-passage novel cell lines designated RSBS-9, -?14 and?-?23 from squamous cell carcinoma and RSBS-43 from adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix were established. All were HPV16+. VNTR assay confirmed their uniqueness and derivation from respective parental tissue. CSC isolated from these cell lines showed CD133+phenotype. In tissue samples of untreated invasive cervical cancer, CD133+CSCs ranged from 1.3-23% of the total population which increased 2.8-fold in radiation-resistant cases. Comparison of CD133+with CD133-bulk population cells revealed increased tumorsphere formation and upregulation of stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers with no significant difference in cisplatin sensitivity.Low-passage cell lines developed would serve as models for studying tumor biology. Cancer Stem Cells in cervical cancer display CD133+phenotype and are increased in relapsed cases and hence should be targeted for achieving remission."
"Elucidation of the space flight effects on the adult stem and progenitor cells is an important goal in space biology and medicine. A unique opportunity for this was provided by project ""BION-M1"". The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of 30-day space flight (SF) on biosatellite, 7-day recovery (SFR) and subsequent ground control (GC) experiment on the mononuclears (MNCs) from C57/BI/6N murine tibia bone marrow. Also, hematopoietic and stromal precursor functions were characterised ex vivo. There was no significant difference in the total MNC number between experimental groups. After SF, immunophenotyping revealed an increase of large-sized CD45+MNCs corresponded to committed hematopoietic progenitors. The total hematopoietic CFU number decreased after space flight and did not restore after 7-day of recovery due to predominant reduction of bi- and multipotent CFUs and primitive BFUs in favour of unipotent CFUs. Functional activity of stromal precursors in vitro was only slightly altered. SF cells displayed the enhanced expression of alkaline phosphatase. The data of the GC experiment demonstrated the preservation of the functional activity of progenitor cells from mice bone marrow. The activation of erythropoiesis in expense of BFU-E elevation was detected. After 7 days of recovery, the number of CFUs-f were similar to the vivarium control, while the proliferative activity of bone marrow stromal precursors decreased. The present study demonstrated that certain hematopoietic progenitors are susceptible to space flight factors, while the MSCs displayed a certain degree of resistance. These data indicate mild and reversible alterations of bone marrow progenitors after space flight."
"Immune checkpoint inhibition used in combination with standard cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens is currently under evaluation in clinical trials for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The impact of anti-PD-1 therapy on cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity has not been established. Here we use a murine model of cisplatin-induced hearing loss to investigate the impact of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy on auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), serum creatinine, and hair cell and renal histology. We demonstrate only mild worsening of DPOAEs at 14.4 and 16 kHz as well as a mild increase in serum creatinine. Renal and hair cell histology as well as ABR measures were unchanged by PD-1 inhibition. Thus, our data suggest that the use of PD-1 inhibition in conjunction with cisplatin results in toxicities that are similar to those of cisplatin alone."
"In recent years, male infertility has become a growing social problem. Standard diagnostic procedures, based on assessing seminological parameters, are often insufficient to explain the causes of male infertility. Because of this, new markers with better clinical application are being sought. One of the promising markers seems to be an assessment of telomere length of sperm. Sperm telomeres, in contrast to somatic cells, are elongated as men age. The results of some studies suggest that telomere length may be relevant in the case of fertilization and normal embryo development. Literature reports indicate that there is a correlation between telomere length of sperm and abnormal sperm parameters. The measurement of telomere length using the method of quantitative PCR could become a new marker of spermatogenesis, which can be useful for evaluating male reproductive age."
"Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology usually require universal expression systems for stable and efficient gene expression in various organisms. In this study, a host-independent and stable T7 expression system had been developed by integrating T7 RNA polymerase and its cognate transcriptional units in single plasmid. The expression of T7 RNA polymerase was restricted below its lethal threshold using a T7 RNA polymerase antisense gene cassette, which allowed long-periods cultivation and protein production. In addition, by designing ribosome binding sites, we further tuned the expression capacity of this novel T7 system within a wide range. This host-independent expression system efficiently expressed genes in five different gram-negative strains and one gram-positive strain and was also shown to be applicable in a real industrial D-p-hydroxyphenylglycine production system."
"                    Objective:
To determine the relative percentage of skeletal muscle mass (SMM) in elderly patients with coronary heart disease, analyse the relationship between percentage of SMM and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), predict exercise capacity and cardiac reserve.Methods:Patients aged 65 years and over after PCI, receiving cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) during February 2014 to December 2016 in Department of Cardiology at Peking University Third Hospital were enrolled.All patients' basic data, percentage of SMM and CPET related parameters, including peak oxygen uptake (VO(2)peak), oxygen pulse (VO(2)/HR), oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) and other cardiorespiratory endurance indicators were collected, to do correlation analysis.Results:There were 402 patients enrolled, with average age (71±5) years, including 283 cases of male (70.40%) and 119 cases of female patients (29.60%). There were 62 patients with acute myocardial infarction (15.42%), 113 patients with old myocardial infarction (28.11%), and 227 patients diagnosed with angina pectoris (56.47%). The percentage of SMM was correlated to CRF.The percentage of SMM[97.00 (92.05, 102.10)%] and VO(2)/HR (r=0.231,P<0.001) and OUES (r=0.264,P<0.001) were positively correlated.Body mass index was negatively correlated with VO(2)peak(r=-0.162,P=0.001). Visceral fat area (VFA) was also negatively correlated with VO(2)peak(r=-0.126,P=0.016). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that Body mass index and VFA were negatively correlated with VO(2)peak (r=-0.204,P=0.014;r=-0.031,P=0.013). The percentage of SMM was positively independently correlated with OUES(r=11.020,P<0.001).Conclusions:Muscle content is positively correlated with exercise capacity of patients.The percentage of skeletal muscle mass determines the core index of cardiorespiratory fitness, such as the slope of oxygen pulse and oxygen uptake efficiency.These indexes can be used as an important criterion for predicting and guiding rehabilitation exercise in patients with coronary heart disease.                ???

"It was analyzed a comparative study of age-dependent changes in the parameters of reproductive function and embryonic development of offspring from adults w1c-s, w1Or mutant strains and Canton-S, Oregon-R wild-type strains D. melanogaster. In investigation three age groups of adult drosophila: 3, 10 and 20-days old were used. Reciprocal crosses between young and aging parents enable to define the influence of age of the maternal and/or paternal organism on the parameters of reproductive function. It is shown that the various features of reproductive function in F1 offspring of mutants and wild-type strains are forming differently by the different influence of the age of parents. The established effect of the white mutation, either as an independent factor or in combination with the parental age, is reflected in the low values of the fertility and viability and high values of dominant lethal mutations and mortality on the metamorphosis stage and consequently the appearance of less adapt and viable offspring in the population.???????? ????????????? ?????? ???????-?????????????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ??????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ???????? ?????

"Abstract- Photoinduced formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins[1,4,5]P3) was examined using a specific radioimmu-noassay to investigate the molecular mechanisms of light signal transduction mediating photophobic responses in the ciliate Blepharisma japonicum. Application of light stimuli of moderate intensity to dark-adapted cells induced a rapid and significant increase in the basal level of Ins (1,4,5)P3, with a peak at about 20 s. Thereafter, the level of Ins (1,4,5)P3declined to the resting value within the subsequent 100 s. Light stimuli of higher intensity raised the cell Ins (1,4,5)P3content to still higher levels within about 20 s, but the decaying time course was considerably prolonged. In ciliates incubated under dark conditions with agents interfering with the inositol signalling pathway, like neomycin and Li+the basal levels of Ins (1,4,5)P3were lower than in control cells. A photoinduced rise of Ins (1,4,5)P3, content in ciliates treated with neomycin or Li+was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Depolarizing ionic stimuli in dark-adapted ciliates induced no significant alterations of the resting Ins (1,4,5)P3level, indicating a lack of a contribution of this kind of stimulation to the inositol turnover. These studies are the first in vivo demonstration of a possible role for inositol trisphosphate as a second messenger in the light signal transduction process in the ciliate B. japonicum."
"Cancer cell invasion is an adaptive process based on cell-intrinsic properties to migrate individually or collectively, and their adaptation to encountered tissue structure acting as barrier or providing guidance. Whereas molecular and physical mechanisms of cancer invasion are well-studied in 3D in vitro models, their topographic relevance, classification and validation toward interstitial tissue organization in vivo remain incomplete. Using combined intravital third and second harmonic generation (THG, SHG), and three-channel fluorescence microscopy in live tumors, we here map B16F10 melanoma invasion into the dermis with up to 600 µm penetration depth and reconstruct both invasion mode and tissue tracks to establish invasion routes and outcome. B16F10 cells preferentially develop adaptive invasion patterns along preformed tracks of complex, multi-interface topography, combining single-cell and collective migration modes, without immediate anatomic tissue remodeling or destruction. The data suggest that the dimensionality (1D, 2D, 3D) of tissue interfaces determines the microanatomy exploited by invading tumor cells, emphasizing non-destructive migration along microchannels coupled to contact guidance as key invasion mechanisms. THG imaging further detected the presence and interstitial dynamics of tumor-associated microparticles with submicron resolution, revealing tumor-imposed conditioning of the microenvironment. These topographic findings establish combined THG, SHG and fluorescence microscopy in intravital tumor biology and provide a template for rational in vitro model development and context-dependent molecular classification of invasion modes and routes."
"To assess dental professionals' understanding of tobacco prevention and control.In Sweden dental hygienists receive training in tobacco prevention and control. The study setting is Västerbotton County in the north of Sweden where a number of successful tobacco control initiatives have been established. A purposeful sample comprising five male and four female dental professionals and trainees was selected. Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured individual interviews and analysed using content analysis.Informants acknowledged limited adherence to tobacco prevention. They were not confident of their knowledge of tobacco and non-communicable disease prevention and had limited awareness of global oral health policies. Reasons for poor adherence included professional fragmentation, lack of training, and the absence of reimbursement for time spent on prevention activities.The success of efforts to reduce smoking in Västerbotton County is attributed to the network of local public health initiatives with very limited involvement by local dental professionals.The findings highlight the need to more actively engage the dental workforce in tobacco control and prevention. Moreover, it is important to recognise that dental professionals can be public health advocates for tobacco control and prevention at global, national and local levels."
"The aim of this Western Australian population study was to assess the relationship of socioeconomic disadvantage and: 1) trends in hospitalisations for oral-health-related conditions over 10 years; 2) insurance status, costs and length of stay in hospital; and 3) specific conditions (principal diagnosis) patients were admitted for.Hospitalisation data (of oral-health-related conditions) were obtained for every episode of discharge from all hospitals in Western Australia for the financial years 1999-2000 to 2008-2009. Area based measures (using the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage) was used to determine relationships between socioeconomic status and other variables.The most disadvantaged in the population are being hospitalised at significantly higher rates than other groups, stay in hospital for longer, and at higher costs. This trend remained over a period of 10 years. Those least disadvantaged have the second highest rates of hospitalisation, but the likelihood of being admitted for different procedures differ between these two extremes.The importance of socioeconomic determinants of health are evident when analysing these hospitalisations. Recognition that lifestyle choices are severely restricted among the most marginalised and disadvantaged groups in the population can no longer be ignored in attempts to reduce health inequalities."
"Latex fractions from Calotropis procera, Cryptostegia grandiflora, Plumeria rubra, and Himatanthus drasticus were assayed in order to prospect for new plant peptidases with milk-clotting activities, for use as rennet alternatives. Only C. procera and C. grandiflora latex fractions exhibited proteolytic and milk-clotting activities, which were not affected by high concentrations of NaCl and CaCl2. However, pre-incubation of both samples at 75°C for 10min eliminated completely their activities. Both proteolytic fractions were able to hydrolyze k-casein and to produce peptides of 16kDa, a similar SDS-PAGE profile to commercial chymosin. RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry analyses of the k-casein peptides showed that the peptidases from C. procera or C. grandiflora hydrolyzed k-casein similar to commercial chymosin. The cheeses made with both latex peptidases exhibited yields, dry masses, and soluble proteins similar to cheeses prepared with commercial chymosin. In conclusion, C. procera and C. grandiflora latex peptidases with the ability to coagulate milk can be used as alternatives to commercial animal chymosin in the cheese manufacturing process."
"Lipid membranes play key roles in cells, such as in trafficking, division, infection, remodeling of organelles, among others. The key step in all these processes is creating membrane curvature, typically under the control of many anchored, adhered or included proteins. However, it has become clear that the membrane itself can mediate the interactions among proteins to produce highly ordered assemblies. Computer simulations are ideally suited to investigate protein organization and the dynamics of membrane remodeling at near-micron scales, something that is extremely challenging to tackle experimentally. We review recent computational efforts in modeling protein-caused membrane deformation mechanisms, specifically focusing on coarse-grained simulations. We highlight work that exposed the membrane-mediated ordering of proteins into lines, meshwork, spirals and other assemblies, in what seems to be a very generic mechanism driven by a combination of short and long-ranged forces. Modulating the mechanical properties of membranes is an underexplored signaling mechanism in various processes deserving of more attention in the near future."
"Tocopherols are lipid-soluble antioxidants that contribute to plant resistance to abiotic stresses. However, it is still unknown to what extent alterations in tocopherol composition can affect the plant response to biotic stresses. The response to bacterial and fungal attack of the vte1 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, which lacks both ?- and ?-tocopherol, was compared to that of the vte4 mutant (which lacks ?- but accumulates ?-tocopherol) and the wild type (with accumulates ?-tocopherol in leaves). Both mutants exhibited similar kinetics of cell death and resistance in response to Pseudomonas syringae. In contrast, both mutants exhibited delayed resistance when infected with Botrytis cinerea. Lipid and hormonal profiling was employed with the aim of assessing the underlying cause of this differential phenotype. Although an altered tocopherol composition in both mutants strongly influenced fatty acid composition, and strongly altered jasmonic acid and cytokinin contents upon infection with B. cinerea, differences between genotypes in these phytohormones were observed during late stages of infection only. By contrast, genotype-related effects on lipid peroxidation, as indicated by malondialdehyde accumulation, were observed early upon infection with B. cinerea. We conclude that an altered tocopherol composition in chloroplasts may negatively influence the plant response to biotic stress in Arabidopsis thaliana through changes in the membrane fatty acid composition, enhanced lipid peroxidation and delayed defence activation when challenged with B. cinerea."
"Using a hydroponics culture system, we monitored morphological, physiological, and molecular changes in Malus prunifolia seedlings when drought conditions induced by 5% polyethylene glycol (PEG) were combined with a low or normal supply of N (0.05?mM or 1?mM NH4NO3, respectively). Under either nutrient level, drought stress negatively inhibited seedling performance, as manifested by reduced photosynthesis and biomass production, decreased accumulations of total N, and inhibited root growth. Concentrations of NO3-and NH4+and the activities of enzymes involved in N metabolism (nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase) were also significantly decreased under drought stress. The net influx of NO3-at the surface of the fine roots declined while that of NH4+rose markedly, suggesting that the latter may play a more important role in improving drought tolerance in M. prunifolia. Consistently, two ammonium transporters (AMT1;2 and AMT4;2) were notably up-regulated in response to drought stress, whereas most genes related to nitrate uptake, reduction, and N metabolism were down-regulated. At the normal N level, PEG-treated plants showed higher values for biomass production, root growth, and N uptake/reduction when compared with plants exposed to the lower N supply. These results suggest that the negative effect of drought stress on M. prunifolia may be alleviated when more nitrogen is available."
"The type A influenza viruses are the most virulent and variable human pathogens with epidemic or even pandemic threat. The development of sensitive, specific and safe field testing methods is in particular need and quite challenging. We report here the selection and practical utilization of the inactivated influenza virus-specific aptamers. The DNA aptamers against inactivated intact H1N1 virus particles were identified through the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure. The discriminative aptamers and their truncated sequences showed selectively high affinity to inactive H1N1 virus and H3N2 virus with the Kdin the low nanomolar range and collective binding properties. The truncated sequences were first applied in a sandwich enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA) with a H1N1 detection limit (LOD, S/N?=?3) of 0.3?ng/?L and then in an electrochemical impedance (EIS) aptasensor with more than 300 times improved LOD (0.9?pg/?L) and the excellent selectivity over other viruses (>?100 times). Therefore the developed aptasensors represent the safer, simpler, and possibly better virus-variation adaptable means of virus diagnostics."
"Cell mechanics plays an important role in regulating the physiological activities of cells. The advent of atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a novel powerful instrument for quantifying the mechanics of single cells at the nanoscale. The applications of AFM in single-cell mechanical assays in the past decade have significantly contributed to the field of cell and molecular biology. However, current AFM-based cellular mechanical studies are commonly carried out with fixed measurement parameters, which provides limited information about the dynamic cellular mechanical behaviors in response to the variable external stimuli. In this work, we utilized AFM to investigate cellular viscoelasticity (portrayed as relaxation time) with varying measurement parameters, including ramp rate and surface dwell time, on both cell lines and primary cells. The experimental results show that the obtained cellular relaxation times are remarkably dependent on the parameter surface dwell time and ramp rate during measurements. Besides, the dependencies to the measurement parameters are variable for different types of cells, which can be potentially used to indicate cell states. The research improves our understanding of single-cell dynamic rheology and provides a novel idea for discriminating different types of cells by AFM-based cellular viscoelastic assays with varying measurement parameters."
"Although androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is initially effective for the treatment of progressive prostate cancer, it inevitably fails due to the onset of diverse resistance mechanisms that restore androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Thus, AR remains a desired therapeutic target even in the relapsed stages of the disease. Given the difficulties in stopping all AR reactivation mechanisms, we propose that the identification of the driver signaling events downstream of the receptor offer viable, alternative therapeutic targets. Here, we summarize recently described, AR-regulated processes that have been demonstrated to promote prostate cancer. By highlighting these signaling events and describing some of the ongoing efforts to pharmacologically modulate these pathways, our goal is to advocate potential new therapeutic targets that would represent an alternative approach for blocking AR actions."
"Diabetes is a fast growing chronic metabolic disorder around the world. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a new promising target during type 2 diabetes glycemic control. Thus, a number of potent DPP-4 inhibitors were developed and play a rapidly evolving role in the management of type 2 diabetes in recent years. This article reviews the development of synthetic and natural DPP-4 inhibitors from 2012 to 2017 and provides their physico-chemical properties, biological activities against DPP-4 and selectivity over dipeptidyl peptidase-8/9. Moreover, the glucose-lowering mechanisms and the active site of DPP-4 are also discussed. We also discuss strategies and structure-activity relationships for identifying potent DPP-4 inhibitors, which will provide useful information for developing potent DPP-4 drugs as type 2 diabtes treatments."
"Mono-cultured and mix-cultured duckweed species were investigated with respect to the function of their associated microbial communities in heavy metal contaminated wastewater. Results show that the carbon source utilization patterns of the L. aequinoctialis- and S. polyrhiza-associated microbial communities were different. The relationships between microbial activity, antioxidant enzyme activity (CAT, GSH, and SOD) and growth was positive and significant. The microbial activity of L. aequinoctialis and S. polyrhiza in mixture was higher than in monoculture in low and high heavy metal, respectively, thereby altering the utilization of specific carbon source types and increasing duckweed growth and antioxidant enzyme activity, when compared to the monocultured duckweed. Furthermore, results indicate that duckweed species in mixture are protected from damage through regulation of the associated bacterial communities."
"Lepidopteran species present an interesting case of sperm polymorphism and testicular fusion. The study of these features are of great importance in understanding the reproductive biology of these insects, especially in the case of those considered pests. Dione juno and Agraulis vanillae stand out as the most important pests of passion fruit (Passiflora sp.) crops in Brazil. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to characterize the testes and germ cells of Dione juno and Agraulis vanillae at different life stages, using light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy, to understand the maturation mechanisms of the male gametes in these species. The study showed that the larvae of both species have a pair of brown kidney-shaped testes, covered by epithelial cells which divide the organ into four follicles. The testes are full of spermatogonia which begin to differentiate in the third larval instar. In the fifth larval instar, spermatozoa can be observed. When they enter the prepupal stage the testes begin a fusion process that is completed in the adult insects, where they present as spherical organs divided into eight follicles, containing all the cells of the germ line. Spermatogenesis occurs centripetally, and in both species, sperm dimorphism is observed, where two different types of spermatozoa are formed, eupyrene (nucleated) and apyrene (anucleate), which differ in morphology and function. Apart from contributing to scientific basic research on the reproductive biology of these insects, the present study provides important data that can aid in research on the physiology, systematics, and control of these species."
"The degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) contributes to cognitive impairment. Nerve growth factor (NGF) secreted in the cerebral cortex is necessary for the phenotypic maintenance of BFCNs. AD is associated with disturbances in NGF metabolism, leading to reduced mature NGF levels and to an accumulation of its precursor, proNGF. We previously described that, in rats, this neurotrophic imbalance is sufficient to induce a loss of cortical cholinergic synapses. In the present study, we investigated whether this neurotrophic imbalance can produce an AD-like retrograde degeneration of BFCNs. Using a combination of retrograde labeling and quantitative cell imaging, we could demonstrate that inhibiting cortical proNGF maturation results in an atrophy of BFCNs, a downregulation of the NGF receptors p75 neurotrophin receptor and tropomyosin receptor kinase A, and a reduction in choline acetyltransferase protein expression. The transient increase in sortilin levels and the sustained colocalization with p75 neurotrophin receptor suggest a participation of proNGF in this degenerative process. This study demonstrates that impairments in the extracellular maturation of proNGF are sufficient to cause a somatodendritic retrograde degeneration of the BFCNs."
"While many consider empathy an exclusively human trait, non-human animals are capable of simple forms of empathy, such as emotional contagion, as well as consolation and helping behavior. Rodent models are particularly useful for describing the neuronal background of these phenomena. They offer the possibility of employing single-cell resolution mapping of the neuronal activity as well as novel techniques for manipulation of in vivo activity, which are currently unavailable in human studies. Here, we review recent developments in the field of rodent empathy research with special emphasis on behavioral paradigms and data on neuronal correlates of emotional contagion. We hope that the use of rodent models will enhance our understanding of social deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders characterized with empathy impairments and the evolutionary continuity of the empathic trait."
"Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Angelo Poliziano were two of the most important humanists of the Italian Renaissance. They died suddenly in 1494 and their deaths have been for centuries a subject of debate. The exhumation of their remains offered the opportunity to study the cause of their death through a multidisciplinary research project. Anthropological analyses, together with documentary evidences, radiocarbon dating and ancient DNA analysis supported the identification of the remains attributed to Pico. Macroscopic examination did not reveal paleopathological lesions or signs related to syphilis. Heavy metals analysis, carried out on bones and mummified tissues, showed that in Pico's remains there were potentially lethal levels of arsenic, supporting the philosopher's poisoning theory reported by documentary sources. The arsenic concentrations obtained from analysis of Poliziano's remains, are probably more related to an As chronic exposure or diagenetic processes rather than poisoning."
"Extremophiles are suitable chassis for developing the next generation industrial biotechnology (NGIB) due to their resistance to microbial contamination. However, engineering extremophiles are not an easy task. Halomonas, an industrially interesting halophile able to grow under unsterile and continuous conditions in large-scale processes, can only be engineered using suicide plasmid-mediated two-step homologous recombination which is very laborious and time-consuming (up to half a year). A convenient approach for the engineering of halophiles that can possibly be extended to other extremophiles is therefore urgently required. To meet this requirement, a rapid, efficient and scarless method via CRISPR/Cas9 system was developed in this study for genome editing in Halomonas. The method achieved the highest efficiency of 100%. When eight different mutants were constructed via this special CRISPR/Cas9 method to study the combinatorial influences of four different genes on the glucose catabolism in H. bluephagenesis TD01, it took only three weeks to complete the deletion and insertion of up to 4.5kb DNA. H. bluephagenesis was designed to produce a microbial copolymer P(3HB-co-3HV) consisting of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV). The CRISPR/Cas9 was employed to delete the prpC gene in H. bluephagenesis TD01. Shake flask studies showed that the 3HV fraction in the copolymers increased approximately 16-folds, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness of the ?prpC mutant to synthesize PHBV. This genome engineering strategy signficantly speeds up the studies on Halomonas engineering, opening up a wide area for developing NGIB."
"Synthetic biology techniques hold great promise for optimising the production of natural products by microorganisms. However, evaluating the phenotype of a modified bacterium represents a major bottleneck to the engineering cycle - particularly for antibiotic-producing actinobacteria strains, which grow slowly and are challenging to genetically manipulate. Here, we report the generation and application of antibiotic-specific whole-cell biosensor derived from TetR transcriptional repressor for use in identifying and optimising antibiotic producers. The constructed biosensor was successfully used to improve production of polyketide antibiotic pamamycin. However, an initial biosensor based on native genetic elements had inadequate dynamic and operating ranges. To overcome these limitations, we fine-tuned biosensor performance through alterations of the promoter and operator of output module and the ligand affinity of transcription factor module, which enabled us to deduce recommendations for building and application of actinobacterial biosensors."
"Serum human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) and transthyretin (TTR) are new markers for ovarian cancer. We compared HE4 and TTR with the gold marker CA-125 for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer patients.130 serum samples from benign ovarian tumor and 400 serum samples from healthy women were used to set up the cut-off. 126 serum samples from ovarian cancer patients before operation were collected to test the diagnostic value of these ELISA assays. The sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and ROC curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic value.For CA-125, the sensitivity and PPV were respectively 64.29% and 53.57% for sage I-II cancer patients, and respectively 91.43% and 88.57% for stage III-IV cancer patients. For HE4, the sensitivity and PPV were respectively 46.4% and 43.3% for sage I-II cancer patients, and respectively 88.6% and 49.2% for stage III-IV cancer patients. For TTR, the sensitivity and PPV were respectively 78.6% and 68.8% for sage I-II cancer patients, and respectively 82.9% and 74.3% for stage III-IV cancer patients. For CA125, the ROC was respectively 0.7941 and 0.9520 for sage I-II patients and stage III-IV patients. For HE4, the diagnostic value of ROC was 0.7071 for sage I-II cancer patients and 0.9250 for stage III-IV cancer patients. For TTR, the diagnostic value of ROC was 0.9112 for sage I-II cancer patients and 0.9322 for stage III-IV cancer patients.Our results support that TTR is an efficient serum marker for the diagnosis of early stage ovarian cancer patients."
"Leishmania infantum is responsible for human and canine leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean basin, where the major vector is Phlebotomus perniciosus. Because isolation of sufficient parasites from the sand fly gut is technically challenging, axenic cultivation of promastigotes is routinely used to obtain material for biochemical and genetic analyses. Here, we report the use of Spliced Leader RNA-seq (SL-seq) to compare transcript abundance in cultured promastigotes and those obtained from the whole midgut of the sand fly 5?days after infection. SL-seq allows for amplification of RNA from the parasite avoiding contamination with RNA from the gut of the insect. The study has been performed by means of a single technical replicate comparing pools of samples obtained from sand fly-derived (sfPro) and axenic culture promastigotes (acPro). Although there was a moderate correlation (R2?=?0.83) in gene expression, 793 genes showed significantly different (?2-fold, p?<?.05) mRNA levels in sand fly-derived promastigotes and in culture, of which 31 were up-regulated ?8-fold (p?<?10-8in most cases). These included several genes that are typically up-regulated during metacyclogenesis, suggesting that sand fly-derived promastigotes contain a substantial number of metacyclics, and/or that their differentiation status as metacyclics is more advanced in these populations. Infection experiments and studies evaluating the proportion of metacyclic promastigotes in culture and whithin the sand fly gut, previously reported by us, support the last hypothesis."
"Astakine is a cytokine-like factor containing a prokineticin domain, which directly participates in hematopoiesis and blood cell differentiation. In the present study, a novel Astakine gene was identified from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis (designated as EsAst). The full-length cDNA of EsAst was of 1163 bp, consisting of a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 120 bp, a 3' UTR of 656 bp, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 387 bp encoding a polypeptide of 128?amino acids. There were a signal peptide and a prokineticin domain with nine conserved cysteine residues in the deduced amino acid sequence of EsAst. EsAst shared higher similarity with Astakines from Penaeus monodon and Pacifastacus leniusculus, and it was closely clustered with the Astakine from shrimp P. monodon in the phylogenetic tree. The EsAst mRNA transcript was higher expressed in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. The relative expression level of EsAst in hemocytes was continuously increased from 1.5 to 48?h after Vibro anguillarum challenge compared that in the untreated control group. After Pichia pastoris GS115 challenge, the relative expression level of EsAst in hemocytes was up-regulated, which was significantly higher than that in the untreated control group. After rEsAst injection, ROS levels in HPT cells were also increased at 12 and 24?h, and the total hemocyte counts were also significantly increased at 6, 9, 12, and 24?h post rEsAst injection. The interference of EsAst expression with dsRNA injection could delay the recovery of hemocytes production post A. hydrophila stimulation. When mitochondrial complexes I was knock down by dsRNA, ROS levels were decreased and THCs were also decreased. Recovery of hemocyte production inducing by A. hydrophila stimulation and rEsAst injection were delayed with dsEsbc1 injection. When ROS levels were increased after RNAi of Lon protease, THCs were also increased. The expression levels of five genes (EsJNK, EsSTAT, EsPI3K, EsAKT1, EsP70S6K) involved in SAPK-JNK and mTOR signaling pathways were up-regulated at 12 and 24?h in rEsAst group and EsLon dsRNA group compared with that in EGFP dsRNA group, and were similar to the trend of ROS levels. These results collectively suggested that EsAst should be a novel Astakine to promote the production of hemocytes in a ROS-dependent way in E. sinensis."
"Clove oil is used as an anaesthetic for many species of fish worldwide; however, relatively few studies have assessed its effects on the innate immune response on these species. The present work aimed to investigate the effects of clove oil-eugenol derived anaesthetic on some humoral and cellular immune response in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.). To compare with an unexposed control group, fish were exposed to 55?ppm clove oil for 5?min, before being sampled at 1, 24 and 48?h post-exposure. Serum glucose level was also measured to obtain information on the fish physiological response after clove oil anaesthesia. One hour after exposure the haemolytic complement activity of fish was lower than in the unexposed group. By contrast, the leucocyte peroxidase activity in head-kidney was significantly stimulated 24?h after exposure to clove oil-eugenol. The rest of innate immune parameters evaluated and the glucose levels not were affected by clove oil exposure at any sampling point. Overall, the use of clove oil at 55?ppm as anaesthetic did not seem to alter the innate immune response and neither did it trigger a stress response. The use of clove oil-eugenol derived had become common practice in aquaculture, and its use with gilthead seabream can be considered safe as it does not cause immunodepression in anesthetized fish."
"Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of neuroimaging studies of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), particularly of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and Tourette's syndrome (TS). Neuroimaging offers immense potential in understanding the biology of these disorders, and how it relates to clinical symptoms. Neuroimaging techniques, in the long run, may help identify neurobiological markers to assist clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, methodological challenges have affected the progress of clinical neuroimaging. This paper reviews the methodological challenges involved in imaging children with NDDs. Specific topics include correcting for head motion, normalization using pediatric brain templates, accounting for psychotropic medication use, delineating complex developmental trajectories, and overcoming smaller sample sizes. The potential of neuroimaging-based biomarkers and the utility of implementing neuroimaging in a clinical setting are also discussed. Data-sharing approaches, technological advances, and an increase in the number of longitudinal, prospective studies are recommended as future directions. Significant advances have been made already, and future decades will continue to see innovative progress in neuroimaging research endeavors of NDDs."
"Membrane proteins remain a somewhat enigmatic group of biomolecules. On the one hand they mediate some of the most important processes in biology with molecular mechanisms that are often elegantly complex. On the other hand they are exceptionally challenging to produce, making studies of membrane protein structure and function among the most difficult projects undertaken by biochemists. The central issue with studies of a membrane protein has been the need to extract them from their native lipid environment before purification and production of a homogenous sample. Historical approaches have utilized detergent solubilisation but these often lead to a sample with low activity and stability. In the past 15 years a new approach that focuses on preserving the local lipid environment surrounding the membrane proteins has been developed. The latest, and perhaps most complete, incarnation of this method has been the use of polymers based on styrene maleic acid (SMA) to stabilise nanoscale discs of lipid that contain membrane proteins. In this review we examine the range of SMA-related polymers that have now been shown to have utility in the production of membrane proteins. We discuss the differences between the polymers and attempt to discover rules and trends that explain their behavior."
"Restoration of the Chol homeostasis in the Central Nervous System (CNS) could be beneficial for the treatment of Huntington's Disease (HD), a progressive, fatal, adult-onset, neurodegenerative disorder. Unfortunately, Chol is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thus a novel strategy for a targeted delivery of Chol into the brain is highly desired. This article aims to investigate the production of hybrid nanoparticles composed by Chol and PLGA (MIX-NPs) modified with g7 ligand for BBB crossing. We described the impact of ratio between components (Chol and PLGA) and formulation process (nanoprecipitation or single emulsion process) on physico-chemical and structural characteristics, we tested MIX-NPs in vitro using primary hippocampal cell cultures evaluating possible toxicity, uptake, and the ability to influence excitatory synaptic receptors. Our results elucidated that both formulation processes produce MIX-NPs with a Chol content higher that 40%, meaning that Chol is a structural particle component and active compound at the same time. The formulation strategy impacted the architecture and reorganization of components leading to some differences in Chol availability between the two types of g7 MIX-NPs. Our results identified that both kinds of MIX-NPs are efficiently taken up by neurons, able to escape lysosomes and release Chol into the cells resulting in an efficient modification in expression of synaptic receptors that could be beneficial in HD."
"Aspergillus is a fungal genus comprising several hundred species, many of which can damage the health of plants, animals and humans by direct infection and/or due to the production of toxic secondary metabolites known as mycotoxins. Aspergillus-specific antibodies have been generated against polypeptides, polysaccharides and secondary metabolites found in the cell wall or secretions, and these can be used to detect and monitor infections or to quantify mycotoxin contamination in food and feed. However, most Aspergillus-specific antibodies are generated against heterogeneous antigen preparations and the specific target remains unknown. Target identification is important because this can help to characterize fungal morphology, confirm host penetration by opportunistic pathogens, detect specific disease-related biomarkers, identify new candidate targets for antifungal drug design, and qualify antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In this review, we discuss how antibodies are raised against heterogeneous Aspergillus antigen preparations and how they can be characterized, focusing on strategies to identify their specific antigens and epitopes. We also discuss the therapeutic, diagnostic and biotechnological applications of Aspergillus-specific antibodies."
"In the present study, complete genomic sequences retrieved from 57 rhizobial strains that covered four genera including 11 species were analyzed comprehensively. The four types of replicons: chromosomes, chromids, nonsymbiotic plasmids, and symbiotic plasmids were investigated and compared among these strains. Results showed that co-evolution occurred among these four replicons based on the similarities in average nucleotide identity. High correlation coefficient r values were observed between chromosomes and chromids, as well as between chromosomes and nonsymbiotic plasmids. Chromosomes and symbiotic plasmids showed different phylogenetic topology based on their core genes. Population structure analyses were performed to extrapolate the evolutionary histories of the test strains based on their chromosomal and symbiotic plasmid background. This resulted in seven ancestral types for chromosomal genes and three ancestral types for symbiotic plasmid genes. Rhizobial strains containing chromosome genes with ancestral type E tend to contain symbiotic plasmid genes with ancestral type II, while rhizobial strains containing chromosome genes with ancestral type G tend to contain symbiotic plasmid genes with ancestral type III. Seventeen strains associated with different host plant species which harbored the symbiotic genes with ancestral type I, exhibited high genetic diversity. In addition, Fu's test of the symbiotic plasmid genes with ancestral type III had undergone an expansion event, implying the influence of negative selection on these symbiotic plasmid genes."
"In this paper, a well secured, high capacity, preserved algorithm is proposed through integrating the cryptography and steganography concepts with the molecular biology concepts. We achieved this by first encrypting the confidential data using the DNA Playfair cipher to avoid extra information sent to the receiver and it consequently acts as a trap for an attacker. Second, it achieves a randomized steganography process by exploiting the DNA conservative mutations. The DNA conservative mutations are utilized in a way that allows a DNA base to be substituted by another base to allow carrying two bits. Consequently, a high capacity feature is obtained with no payload for the used sequence. There are three main achieved contributions in this work. First, is hiding high capacity of data within DNA by exploiting each codon to hide two bits whilst preserving the sequence properties of protein after the steganography process, which is a trade off in the field. Secondly, using the conservative mutation with all its valid biological permutations, leads to the lowest cracking probability achieved and published till now, as proven in the security analysis section. Finally, a comparison is conducted between the proposed algorithm and five recent substitution based algorithms using large sized data up to three megabytes, to prove the algorithm's scalability."
"Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) comprise a superfamily of glycerophospholipids hydrolyzing enzymes present in many organisms in nature, whose catalytic activity was majorly unveiled by analysis of snake venoms. The latter have pharmaceutical and biotechnological interests and can be divided into different functional sub-classes. Our goal was to identify important residues and their relation to the functional and class-specific characteristics in the PLA2s family with special emphasis on snake venom PLA2s (svPLA2s). We identified such residues by conservation analysis and decomposition of residue coevolution networks (DRCN), annotated the results based on the available literature on PLA2s, structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations, and related the results to the phylogenetic distribution of these proteins. A filtered alignment of PLA2s revealed 14 highly conserved positions and 3 sets of coevolved residues, which were annotated according to their structural or functional role. These residues are mostly involved in ligand binding and catalysis, calcium-binding, the formation of disulfide bridges and a hydrophobic cluster close to the binding site. An independent validation of the inference of structure-function relationships from our co-evolution analysis on the svPLA2s family was obtained by the analysis of the pattern of selection acting on the Viperidae and Elapidae lineages. Additionally, a molecular dynamics simulation on the Lys49 PLA2from Agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus was carried out to further investigate the correlation of the Lys49-Glu69 pair. Our results suggest this configuration can result in a novel conformation where the binding cavity collapses due to the approximation of two loops caused by a strong salt bridge between Glu69 and Arg34. Finally, phylogenetic analysis indicated a correlation between the presence of residues in the coevolved sets found in this analysis and the clade localization. The results provide a guide for important positions in the family of PLA2s, and potential new objects of investigation."
"The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) are xenobiotic sensors that regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and efflux transporters. CAR activation promotes drug elimination, thereby reducing therapeutic effectiveness, or causes adverse drug effects via toxic metabolites. CAR inhibitors could be used to attenuate these adverse drug effects. CAR and PXR share ligands and target genes, confounding the understanding of the regulation of receptor-specific activity. We previously identified a small-molecule inhibitor, CINPA1, that inhibits CAR (without activating PXR at lower concentrations) by altering CAR-coregulator interactions and reducing CAR recruitment to DNA response elements of regulated genes. However, solid evidence was not presented for the direct binding of CINPA1 to CAR. In this study, we demonstrate direct interaction of CINPA1 with the CAR ligand-binding domain (CAR-LBD) and identify key residues involved in such interactions through a combination of biophysical and computational methods. We found that CINPA1 resides in the ligand-binding pocket to stabilize the CAR-LBD in a more rigid, less fluid state. Molecular dynamics simulations, together with our previously reported docking model, enabled us to predict which CAR residues were critical for interactions with CINPA1. The importance of these residues for CINPA1 binding were then validated by directed mutations and testing the mutant CAR proteins in transcription reporter and coregulatory interaction assays. We demonstrated strong hydrogen bonding of CINPA1 with N165 and H203 and identified other residues involved in hydrophobic contacts with CINPA1. Overall, our data confirm that CINPA1 directly binds to CAR."
"This study evaluated the effects of elevated homocysteine (Hcy) on the oxidative stress response in retinal Müller glial cells. Elevated Hcy has been implicated in retinal diseases including glaucoma and optic neuropathy, which are characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss. To understand the mechanisms of Hcy-induced RGC loss, in vitro and in vivo models have been utilized. In vitro isolated RGCs are quite sensitive to elevated Hcy levels, while in vivo murine models of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) demonstrate a more modest RGC loss (?20%) over a period of many months. This differential response to Hcy between isolated cells and the intact retina suggests that the retinal milieu invokes mechanisms that buffer excess Hcy. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a mechanism of Hcy-induced neuron loss and NRF2 is a transcription factor that plays a major role in regulating cytoprotective responses to oxidative stress. In the present study we investigated whether HHcy upregulates NRF2-mediated stress responses in Müller cells, the chief retinal glial cell responsible for providing trophic support to retinal neurons. Primary Müller cells were exposed to L-Hcy-thiolactone [50?M-10mM] and assessed for viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glutathione (GSH) levels. Gene/protein levels of Nrf2 and levels of NRF2-regulated antioxidants (NQO1, CAT, SOD2, HMOX1, GPX1) were assessed in Hcy-exposed Müller cells. Unlike isolated RGCs, isolated Müller cells are viable over a wide range of Hcy concentrations [50??M - 1?mM]. Moreover, when exposed to elevated Hcy, Müller cells demonstrate decreased oxidative stress and decreased ROS levels. GSH levels increased by ?20% within 24?h exposure to Hcy. Molecular analyses revealed 2-fold increase in Nrf2 expression. Expression of antioxidant genes Nqo1, Cat, Sod2, Hmox1, Gpx1 increased significantly. The consequences of Hcy exposure were evaluated also in Müller cells harvested from Nrf2-/-mice. In contrast to WT Müller cells, in which oxidative stress decreased upon exposure to Hcy, the Nrf2-/-Müller cells showed a significant increase in oxidative stress. Our data suggest that at least during early stages of Hhcy, a cytoprotective response may be in place, mediated in part by NRF2 in Müller cells."
"Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the greatest risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, but only a small proportion of patients with BE develop cancer. Biomarkers might be able to identify patients at highest risk of progression. We investigated genomic differences in surveillance biopsies collected from patients whose BE subsequently progressed compared to patients whose disease did not progress.We performed a retrospective case-control study of 24 patients with BE that progressed to high-grade dysplasia (HGD, n=14) or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC, n=10). The control group (n=73, called non-progressors) comprised patients with BE and least 5 years of total endoscopic biopsy surveillance without progression to HGD or EAC. From each patient, we selected a single tissue sample obtained more than 1 year before progression (cases) or more than 2 years before the end of follow up (controls). Pathogenic mutations, gene copy numbers, and ploidy were compared between samples from progressors and non-progressors.TP53 mutations were detected in 46% of samples from progressors and 5% of non-progressors. In this case-control sample set, TP53 mutations in BE tissues increased the adjusted risk of progression 13.8-fold (95% CI, 3.2-61.0) (P<.001). We did not observe significant differences in ploidy or copy number profile between groups. We identified 147 pathogenic mutations in 57 distinct genes-the average number of pathogenic mutations was higher in samples from progressors (2.5) than non-progressors (1.2) (P<.001). TP53 and other somatic mutations were recurrently detected in samples with limited copy number changes (aneuploidy).In genomic analyses of BE tissues from patients with or without later progression to HGD or EAC, we found significantly higher numbers of TP53 mutations in BE from patients with subsequent progression. These mutations were frequently detected before the onset of dysplasia or substantial changes in copy number."
"The aim of this study was to gain insights into the biology and mechanics of immediate postextraction implant osseointegration. To mimic clinical practice, murine first molar extraction was followed by osteotomy site preparation, specifically in the palatal root socket. The osteotomy was positioned such that it removed periodontal ligament (PDL) only on the palatal aspect of the socket, leaving the buccal aspect undisturbed. This strategy created 2 distinct peri-implant environments: on the palatal aspect, the implant was in direct contact with bone, while on the buccal aspect, a PDL-filled gap existed between the implant and bone. Finite element modeling showed high strains on the palatal aspect, where bone was compressed by the implant. Osteocyte death and bone resorption predominated on the palatal aspect, leading to the loss of peri-implant bone. On the buccal aspect, where finite element modeling revealed low strains, there was minimal osteocyte death and robust peri-implant bone formation. Initially, the buccal aspect was filled with PDL remnants, which we found directly provided Wnt-responsive cells that were responsible for new bone formation and osseointegration. On the palatal aspect, which was devoid of PDL and Wnt-responsive cells, adding exogenous liposomal WNT3A created an osteogenic environment for rapid peri-implant bone formation. Thus, we conclude that low strain and high Wnt signaling favor osseointegration of immediate postextraction implants. The PDL harbors Wnt-responsive cells that are inherently osteogenic, and if the PDL tissue is healthy, it is reasonable to preserve this tissue during immediate implant placement."
"The recombination dynamics of two oppositely charged bipolarons within a single polymer chain is numerically studied in the scope of a one-dimensional tight-binding model that considers electron-electron and electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions. By scanning among values of e-ph coupling and electric field, novel channels for the bipolaron recombination were yielded based on the interplay between these two parameters. The findings point to the formation of a compound species formed from the coupling between a bipolaron and an exciton. Depending on the electric field and e-ph coupling strengths, the recombination mechanism may yield two distinct products: a trapped (and almost neutral) or a moving (and partially charged) bipolaron-exciton. These results might enlighten the understanding of the electroluminescence processes in organic light-emitting devices."
"In Bacteria, ribosomes may bind to the nascent RNA emerging from the transcribing RNA polymerase and initiate translation. Transcription-translation coupling plays diverse roles in cellular physiology, including attenuation control, mRNA surveillance, and maintenance of genome integrity. While the existence of coupling is broadly accepted, its mechanism and ubiquity are debated. Structural evidence supports mutually exclusive modes of RNA polymerase-ribosome contacts. In a model based on nuclear magnetic resonance data, NusG binds to a ribosomal protein S10 and acts as an adapter between RNA polymerase and the 30S subunit. Recent single-particle cryo electron microscopy analyses of RNA polymerase bound to 30S and 70S ribosomes revealed extensive, and very distinct, contacts which are incompatible with bridging by NusG. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Saxena et al. provide the first evidence for NusG-mediated coupling in vivo. Their results demonstrate that Escherichia coli NusG interacts with the 70S ribosomes through a previously established interface and that these interactions are required for survival when translation elongation is hindered to weaken coupling. Future studies will address a likely possibility that distinct bridging mechanisms underpin context-dependent coupling in the cell. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
"The ability of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans to adapt to variable copper (Cu) environments within the host is key for successful dissemination and colonization. During pulmonary infection, host alveolar macrophages compartmentalize Cu into the phagosome and C. neoformans Cu-detoxifying metallothioneins, MT1 and MT2, are required for survival of the pathogen. In contrast, during brain colonization the C. neoformans Cu+importers Ctr1 and Ctr4 are required for virulence. Central for the regulation and expression of both the Cu detoxifying MT1/2 and the Cu acquisition Ctr1/4 proteins is the Cu-metalloregulatory transcription factor Cuf1, an established C. neoformans virulence factor. Due to the importance of the distinct C. neoformans Cu homeostasis mechanisms during host colonization and virulence, and to the central role of Cuf1 in regulating Cu homeostasis, we performed a combination of RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq experiments to identify differentially transcribed genes between conditions of high and low Cu. We demonstrate that the transcriptional regulation exerted by Cuf1 is intrinsically complex and that Cuf1 also functions as a transcriptional repressor. The Cu- and Cuf1-dependent regulon in C. neoformans reveals new adaptive mechanisms for Cu homeostasis in this pathogenic fungus and identifies potential new pathogen-specific targets for therapeutic intervention in fungal infections.

"The slipper orchids (Cypripedioideae) are a morphologically distinct subfamily of Orchidaceae. They also have some of the largest genomes in the orchids, which may be due to polyploidy or some other mechanism of genome evolution. We generated 10 transcriptomes and incorporated existing RNA-seq data to infer a multilocus nuclear phylogeny of the Cypripedioideae and to determine whether a whole-genome duplication event (WGD) correlated with the large genome size of this subfamily. Knowing more about timing of ancient polyploidy events can help us understand the evolution of one of the most species-rich plant families.Transcriptome data were used to identify low-copy orthologous genes to infer a phylogeny of Orchidaceae and to identify paralogs to place any WGD events on the species tree.Our transcriptome phylogeny confirmed relationships published in previous studies that used fewer markers but incorporated more taxa. We did not find a WGD event at the base of the slipper orchids; however, we did identify one on the Orchidaceae stem lineage. We also confirmed the presence of a previously identified WGD event deeper in the monocot phylogeny.Although WGD has played a role in the evolution of Orchidaceae, polyploidy does not appear to be responsible for the large genome size of slipper orchids. The conserved set of 775 largely single-copy nuclear genes identified in this study should prove useful in future studies of orchid evolution."
"A species' distribution and abundance are determined by abiotic conditions and biotic interactions with other species in the community. Most species distribution models correlate the occurrence of a single species with environmental variables only, and leave out biotic interactions. To test the importance of biotic interactions on occurrence and abundance, we compared a multivariate spatiotemporal model of the joint abundance of two invasive insects that share a host plant, hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (EHS; Fiorina externa), to independent models that do not account for dependence among co-occurring species. The joint model revealed that HWA responded more strongly to abiotic conditions than EHS. Additionally, HWA appeared to predispose stands to subsequent increase of EHS, but HWA abundance was not strongly dependent on EHS abundance. This study demonstrates how incorporating spatial and temporal dependence into a species distribution model can reveal the dependence of a species' abundance on other species in the community. Accounting for dependence among co-occurring species with a joint distribution model can also improve estimation of the abiotic niche for species affected by interspecific interactions."
"To compare the trajectories of motor and cognitive decline in older adults who progress to dementia with the trajectories of those who do not. To evaluate the added value of measuring motor and cognitive decline longitudinally versus cross-sectionally for predicting dementia.Prospective cohort study with 5 years of follow-up.Clinic based at a university hospital in London, Ontario, Canada.Community-dwelling participants aged 65 and older free of dementia at baseline (N=154).We evaluated trajectories in participants' motor performance using gait velocity and cognitive performance using the MoCA test twice a year for 5 years. We ascertained incident dementia risk using Cox regression models and attributable risk analyses. Analyses were adjusted using a time-dependent covariate.Overall, 14.3% progressed to dementia. The risk of dementia was almost 7 times as great for those whose gait velocity declined (hazard ratio (HR)=6.89, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.18-21.75, p=.001), more than 3 times as great for those with cognitive decline (HR=3.61, 95% CI=1.28-10.13, p=.01), and almost 8 times as great in those with combined gait velocity and cognitive decline (HR=7.83, 95% CI=2.10-29.24, p=.002), with an attributable risk of 105 per 1,000 person years. Slow gait at baseline alone failed to predict dementia (HR=1.16, 95% CI=0.39-3.46, p=.79).Motor decline, assessed according to serial measures of gait velocity, had a higher attributable risk for incident dementia than did cognitive decline. A decline over time of both gait velocity and cognition had the highest attributable risk. A single time-point assessment was not sufficient to detect individuals at high risk of dementia."
"Luteinizing hormone (LH) acts on the granulosa cells that surround the oocyte in mammalian preovulatory follicles to cause meiotic resumption and ovulation. Both of these responses are mediated primarily by an increase in cAMP in the granulosa cells, and activity of the cAMP phosphodiesterase PDE4 contributes to preventing premature responses. However, 2 other cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases, PDE7 and PDE8, are also expressed at high levels in the granulosa cells, raising the question of whether these phosphodiesterases also contribute to preventing uncontrolled activation of meiotic resumption and ovulation. Using selective inhibitors, we show that inhibition of PDE7 or PDE8 alone has no effect on the cAMP content of follicles, and inhibition of PDE4 alone has only a small and variable effect. In contrast, a mixture of the 3 inhibitors elevates cAMP to a level comparable to that seen with LH. Correspondingly, inhibition of PDE7 or PDE8 alone has no effect on meiotic resumption or ovulation, and inhibition of PDE4 alone has only a partial and slow effect. However, the fraction of oocytes resuming meiosis and undergoing ovulation is increased when PDE4, PDE7, and PDE8 are simultaneously inhibited. PDE4, PDE7, and PDE8 also function together to suppress the premature synthesis of progesterone and progesterone receptors, which are required for ovulation. Our results indicate that 3 cAMP phosphodiesterases act in concert to suppress premature responses in preovulatory follicles."
"Annually, thousands of air travellers visit high altitude destinations to enjoy hiking tours to attractions in surrounding areas. However, many of them are not adequately trained, not sufficiently acclimatized and/or may suffer from pre-existing diseases. To prevent adverse health effects and unpleasant experiences at high altitude, simple submaximal exercise testing at low altitude for the prediction of exercise tolerance at high altitude would be helpful. Therefore, 40 healthy males and females performed submaximal exercise tests at low (600 m) and high altitude (3500 m). We demonstrate that exercise tolerance during acute exposure to high altitude can be predicted by the individual heart rate response to submaximal exercise assessed at low altitude."
"Balancing selection maintains advantageous diversity in populations through various mechanisms. Although extensively explored from a theoretical perspective, an empirical understanding of its prevalence and targets lags behind our knowledge of positive selection. Here, we describe the Non-central Deviation (NCD), a simple yet powerful statistic to detect long-term balancing selection (LTBS) that quantifies how close frequencies are to expectations under LTBS, and provides the basis for a neutrality test. NCD can be applied to a single locus or genomic data, and can be implemented considering only polymorphisms (NCD1) or also considering fixed differences with respect to an outgroup (NCD2) species. Incorporating fixed differences improves power, and NCD2 has higher power to detect LTBS in humans under different frequencies of the balanced allele(s) than other available methods. Applied to genome-wide data from African and European human populations, in both cases using chimpanzee as an outgroup, NCD2 shows that, albeit not prevalent, LTBS affects a sizable portion of the genome: ?0.6% of analyzed genomic windows and 0.8% of analyzed positions. Significant windows (P?<?0.0001) contain 1.6% of SNPs in the genome, which disproportionally fall within exons and change protein sequence, but are not enriched in putatively regulatory sites. These windows overlap ?8% of the protein-coding genes, and these have larger number of transcripts than expected by chance even after controlling for gene length. Our catalog includes known targets of LTBS but a majority of them (90%) are novel. As expected, immune-related genes are among those with the strongest signatures, although most candidates are involved in other biological functions, suggesting that LTBS potentially influences diverse human phenotypes."
"Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) are a group of specialized mammals that evolved from terrestrial ancestors and are fully adapted to aquatic habitats. Taking advantage of the recently sequenced finless porpoise genome, we conducted comparative analyses of the genomes of seven cetaceans and related terrestrial species to provide insight into the molecular bases of adaptation of these aquatic mammals. Changes in gene sequences were identified in main lineages of cetaceans, offering an evolutionary picture of cetacean genomes that reveal new pathways that could be associated with adaptation to aquatic lifestyle. We profiled bone microanatomical structures across 28 mammals, including representatives of cetaceans, pinnipeds, and sirenians. Subsequent phylogenetic comparative analyses revealed genes (including leptin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and collagen type I alpha 2 chain) with the root-to-tip substitution rate significantly correlated with bone compactness, implicating these genes could be involved in bone mass control. Overall, this study described adjustments of the genomes of cetaceans according to lifestyle, phylogeny, and bone mass."
"Ciliated protists are a large group of single-celled eukaryotes with separate germline and somatic nuclei in each cell. The somatic genome is developed from the zygotic nucleus through a series of chromosomal rearrangements, including fragmentation, DNA elimination, de novo telomere addition, and DNA amplification. This unique feature makes them perfect models for research in genome biology and evolution. However, genomic research of ciliates has been limited to a few species, owing to problems with DNA contamination and obstacles in cultivation. Here, we introduce a method combining telomere-primer PCR amplification and high-throughput sequencing, which can reduce DNA contamination and obtain genomic data efficiently. Based on this method, we report a draft somatic genome of a multimacronuclear ciliate, Uroleptopsis citrina. 1) The telomeric sequence in U. citrina is confirmed to be C4A4C4A4C4 by directly blunt-end cloning. 2) Genomic analysis of the resulting chromosomes shows a ""one-gene one-chromosome"" pattern, with a small number of multiple-gene chromosomes. 3) Amino acid usage is analyzed, and reassignment of stop codons is confirmed. 4) Chromosomal analysis shows an obvious asymmetrical GC skew and high bias between A and T in the subtelomeric regions of the sense-strand, with the detection of an 11-bp high AT motif region in the 3' subtelomeric region. 5) The subtelomeric sequence also has an obvious 40?nt strand oscillation of nucleotide ratio. 6) In the 5' subtelomeric region of the coding strand, the distribution of potential TATA-box regions is illustrated, which accumulate between 30 and 50?nt. This work provides a valuable reference for genomic research and furthers our understanding of the dynamic nature of unicellular eukaryotic genomes."
"Reduced visibility of women in science is thought to be one of the causes of their underrepresentation among scientists, in particular at senior positions. Visibility is achieved through publications, and through conference attendance and presentations. Here, we investigated gender differences in visibility at the annual meetings of the Society of Molecular Biology and Evolution. The analysis of meeting programs showed a regular increase in female speakers for the last 16 years. Data on abstract submission suggest that there are no gender-related preferences in the acceptance of contributed presentations at the most recent meetings. However, data collected on-site in 2015 and 2016 show that women asked only ?25% of the questions, that is, much less than expected given the female attendance. Understanding the reasons for this pattern is necessary for the development of policies that aim to reduce imbalance in visibility."
"The common transition from out-crossing to self-fertilization in plants decreases effective population size. This is expected to result in a reduced efficacy of natural selection and in increased rates of protein evolution in selfing plants compared with their outcrossing congeners. Prior analyses, based on a very limited number of genes, detected no differences between the rates of protein evolution in the selfing Arabidopsis thaliana compared with the out-crosser Arabidopsis lyrata. Here, we reevaluate this trend using the complete genomes of A. thaliana, A. lyrata, Arabidopsis halleri, and the outgroups Capsella rubella and Thellungiella parvula. Our analyses indicate slightly but measurably higher nonsynonymous divergences (dN), synonymous divergences (dS) and dN/dS ratios in A. thaliana compared with the other Arabidopsis species, indicating that purifying selection is indeed less efficacious in A. thaliana."
"Humans experience higher rates of age-associated diseases than our closest living evolutionary relatives, chimpanzees. Environmental factors can explain many of these increases in disease risk, but species-specific genetic changes can also play a role. Alleles that confer increased disease susceptibility later in life can persist in a population in the absence of selective pressure if those changes confer positive adaptation early in life. One age-associated disease that disproportionately affects humans compared with chimpanzees is epithelial cancer. Here, we explored genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees in a well-defined experimental assay that mimics gene expression changes that happen during cancer progression: A fibroblast serum challenge. We used this assay with fibroblasts isolated from humans and chimpanzees to explore species-specific differences in gene expression and chromatin state with RNA-Seq and DNase-Seq. Our data reveal that human fibroblasts increase expression of genes associated with wound healing and cancer pathways; in contrast, chimpanzee gene expression changes are not concentrated around particular functional categories. Chromatin accessibility dramatically increases in human fibroblasts, yet decreases in chimpanzee cells during the serum response. Many regions of opening and closing chromatin are in close proximity to genes encoding transcription factors or genes involved in wound healing processes, further supporting the link between changes in activity of regulatory elements and changes in gene expression. Together, these expression and open chromatin data show that humans and chimpanzees have dramatically different responses to the same physiological stressor, and how a core physiological process can evolve quickly over relatively short evolutionary time scales."
"Amino acid usage in a proteome depends mostly on its taxonomy, as it does the codon usage in transcriptomes. Here, we explore the level of variation in the codon usage of a specific amino acid, glutamine, in relation to the number of consecutive glutamine residues. We show that CAG triplets are consistently more abundant in short glutamine homorepeats (polyQ, four to eight residues) than in shorter glutamine stretches (one to three residues), leading to the evolutionary growth of the repeat region in a CAG-dependent manner. The length of orthologous polyQ regions is mostly stable in primates, particularly the short ones. Interestingly, given a short polyQ the CAG usage is higher in unstable-in-length orthologous polyQ regions. This indicates that CAG triplets produce the necessary instability for a glutamine stretch to grow. Proteins related to polyQ-associated diseases behave in a more extreme way, with longer glutamine stretches in human and evolutionarily closer nonhuman primates, and an overall higher CAG usage. In the light of our results, we suggest an evolutionary model to explain the glutamine codon usage in polyQ regions."
"Perfect short inverted repeats (IRs) are known to be enriched in a variety of bacterial and eukaryotic genomes. Currently, it is unclear whether perfect IRs are conserved over evolutionary time scales. In this study, we aimed to characterize the prevalence and evolutionary conservation of IRs across 20 proteobacterial strains. We first identified IRs in Escherichia coli K-12 substr MG1655 and showed that they are overabundant. We next aimed to test whether this overabundance is reflected in the conservation of IRs over evolutionary time scales. To this end, for each perfect IR identified in E. coli MG1655, we collected orthologous sequences from related proteobacterial genomes. We next quantified the evolutionary conservation of these IRs, that is, the presence of the exact same IR across orthologous regions. We observed high conservation of perfect IRs: out of the 234 examined orthologous regions, 145 were more conserved than expected, which is statistically significant even after correcting for multiple testing. Our results together with previous experimental findings support a model in which imperfect IRs are corrected to perfect IRs in a preferential manner via a template switching mechanism."
"There exists extraordinary variation among species in the degree and nature of sex chromosome divergence. However, much of our knowledge about sex chromosomes is based on comparisons between deeply diverged species with different ancestral sex chromosomes, making it difficult to establish how fast and why sex chromosomes acquire variable levels of divergence. To address this problem, we studied sex chromosome evolution in two species of African clawed frog (Xenopus), both of whom acquired novel systems for sex determination from a recent common ancestor, and both of whom have female (ZW/ZZ) heterogamy. Derived sex chromosomes of one species, X. laevis, have a small region of suppressed recombination that surrounds the sex determining locus, and have remained this way for millions of years. In the other species, X. borealis, a younger sex chromosome system exists on a different pair of chromosomes, but the region of suppressed recombination surrounding an unidentified sex determining gene is vast, spanning almost half of the sex chromosomes. Differences between these sex chromosome systems are also apparent in the extent of nucleotide divergence between the sex chromosomes carried by females. Our analyses also indicate that in autosomes of both of these species, recombination during oogenesis occurs more frequently and in different genomic locations than during spermatogenesis. These results demonstrate that new sex chromosomes can assume radically different evolutionary trajectories, with far-reaching genomic consequences. They also suggest that in some instances the origin of new triggers for sex determination may be coupled with rapid evolution sex chromosomes, including recombination suppression of large genomic regions."
"Transposable elements (TEs) compose the majority of angiosperm DNA. Plants counteract TE activity by silencing them epigenetically. One form of epigenetic silencing requires 21-22?nt small interfering RNAs that act to degrade TE mRNA and may also trigger DNA methylation. DNA methylation is reinforced by a second mechanism, the RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. RdDM relies on 24?nt small interfering RNAs and ultimately establishes TEs in a quiescent state. These host factors interact at a systems level, but there have been no system level analyses of their interactions. Here, we define a deterministic model that represents the propagation of active TEs, aspects of the host response and the accumulation of silenced TEs. We describe general properties of the model and also fit it to biological data in order to explore two questions. The first is why two overlapping pathways are maintained, given that both are likely energetically expensive. Under our model, RdDM silenced TEs effectively even when the initiation of silencing was weak. This relationship implies that only a small amount of RNAi is needed to initiate TE silencing, but reinforcement by RdDM is necessary to efficiently counter TE propagation. Second, we investigated the reliance of the host response on rates of TE deletion. The model predicted that low levels of deletion lead to few active TEs, suggesting that silencing is most efficient when methylated TEs are retained in the genome, thereby providing one explanation for the large size of plant genomes."
"With the genomes available for many animal clades, including the early-branching metazoans, one can readily study the functional conservation of genes across a diversity of animal lineages. Ectopic expression of an animal protein in, for instance, a mammalian cell line is a generally used strategy in structure-function analysis. However, this might turn out to be problematic in case of distantly related species. Here we analyzed the GC content of the coding sequences of basal animals and show its impact on gene expression levels in human cell lines, and, importantly, how this expression efficiency can be improved. Optimization of the GC3 content in the coding sequences of cadherin, alpha-catenin, and paracaspase of Trichoplax adhaerens dramatically increased the expression of these basal animal genes in human cell lines."
"Early during human development, the trophoblast lineage differentiates to commence placentation. Where the placenta contacts the uterine decidua, extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells differentiate and invade maternal tissues. EVT cells, identified by expression of HLA-G, invade into uterine blood vessels (endovascular EVT), as well as glands (endoglandular EVT), and open such luminal structures towards the intervillous space of the placenta. Endoglandular invasion diverts the contents of uterine glands to the intervillous space, while glands near the margin of the placenta that also contain endoglandular EVT cells open into the reproductive tract. Cells of the trophoblast lineage have thus been recovered from the uterine cavity and endocervical canal. An emerging non-invasive technology [trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC)] isolates and examines EVT cells residing in the cervix to explore their origin, biology and relationship to pregnancy and fetal status.This review explores the origins and possible uses of trophoblast cells obtained during ongoing pregnancies (weeks 5-20) by TRIC. We hypothesize that endoglandular EVT cells at the margins of the expanding placenta enter the uterine cavity and are carried together with uterine secretion products to the cervix where they can be retrieved from a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. The advantages of TRIC for investigation of human placentation and prenatal testing will be considered. Evidence from the literature, and from archived in utero placental histological sections, is presented to support these hypotheses.We used 52 out of 80 publications that appeared between 1966 and 2017 and were found by searching the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The studies described trophoblast invasion of uterine vessels and glands, as well as trophoblast cells residing in the reproductive tract. This was supplemented with literature on human placental health and disease.The literature describes a variety of invasive routes taken by EVT cells at the fetal-maternal interface that could displace them into the reproductive tract. Since the 1970s, investigators have attempted to recover trophoblast cells from the uterus or cervix for prenatal diagnostics. Trophoblast cells from Pap smears obtained at 5-20 weeks of gestation have been purified (>95% ?-hCG positive) by immunomagnetic isolation with nanoparticles linked to anti-HLA-G (TRIC). The isolated cells contain the fetal genome, and have an EVT-like expression profile. Similar EVT-like cells appear in the lumen of uterine glands and can be observed entering the uterine cavity along the margins of the placenta, suggesting that they are the primary source of cervical trophoblast cells. Cells isolated by TRIC can be used to accurately genotype the embryo/fetus by targeted next-generation sequencing. Biomarker protein expression quantified in cervical trophoblast cells after TRIC correlates with subsequent pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction. A key remaining question is the degree to which EVT cells in the cervix might differ from those in the basal plate and placental bed.TRIC could one day provide a method of risk assessment for maternal and fetal disease, and reveal molecular pathways disrupted during the first trimester in EVT cells associated with placental maldevelopment. As perinatal interventions emerge for pregnancy disorders and inherited congenital disorders, TRIC could provide a key diagnostic tool for personalized precision medicine in obstetrics."

"Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) have always represented a public health concern in the military, yet most studies rely on self-reports among non-random samples of military populations. In addition, most of the studies exploring STI rates among the military focus on US service members. This paper assesses the prevalence and correlates of STIs in the French military using biomarkers and compares self-reported versus diagnosed STIs.Data are drawn from the COSEMIL study, a national sexual health survey conducted in the French military in 2014 and 2015. A random sample of 784 men and 141 women aged 18-57 years completed a self-administered questionnaire and provided biological samples for STI testing. We used logistic regression modeling to identify the correlates of STI diagnosis and self-reports.The prevalence of diagnosed STIs was 4.7% [3.8-5.9], mostly due to Chlamydia trachomatis. This rate was four times higher than the 12 months self-reported rate of 1.1% [0.6-2.3]. Reported STI rates were similar among men and women (1.1% versus 1.8%), but diagnosed STI rates were twice as high among females versus males (10.4% versus 4.1%, p = 0.007). There were significant differences in the determinants of reported versus diagnosed STIs. In particular, age and sexual orientation were associated with reported STIs, but not with diagnosed STIs. Conversely, STI counseling and depression were associated with STI diagnosis but not with STI reports.This study underlines the need to use biomarkers in population-based surveys, given the differential and substantial underreporting of STIs. Results also highlight the need for programmatic adaptation to address gender inequalities in STI rates, by developing women's health services in the French military. Addressing such needs not only benefits women but could also serve as a strategy to reduce overall STI rates as most military women have military partners, increasing the risk of internal transmission."
"Genetic switches frequently include DNA loops secured by proteins. Recent studies of the lambda bacteriophage repressor (CI), showed that this arrangement in which the protein links two sets of three operators separated by approximately 2.3 kbp, optimizes both the stability and dynamics of DNA loops, compared to an arrangement with just two sets of two operators. Because adjacent dimers interact pairwise, we hypothesized that the odd number of operators in each set of the lambda regulatory system might have evolved to allow for semi-specific, pair-wise interactions that add stability to the loop while maintaining it dynamic. More generally, additional CI dimers may bind non-specifically to flanking DNA sequences making the genetic switch more sensitive to CI concentration. Here, we tested this hypothesis using spectroscopic and imaging approaches to study the binding of the lambda repressor (CI) dimer protein to DNA fragments. For fragments with only one operator and a short flanking sequence, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements clearly indicated the presence of two distinct DNA-CI complexes; one is thought to have a non-specifically bound CI dimer on the flanking sequence. Scanning force micrographs of CI bound to DNA with all six operators revealed wild-type or mutant proteins bound at operator positions. The number of bound, wild-type proteins increased with CI concentration and was larger than expected for strictly specific binding to operators. In contrast, a mutant that fails to oligomerize beyond a dimer, D197G, only bound to operators. These data are evidence that CI cooperativity promotes oligomerization that extends from operator sites to influence the thermodynamics and kinetics of CI-mediated looping."
"The PgdS enzyme is a poly-?-glutamic (?-PGA) hydrolase, which has potential application for a controllable degradation of ?-PGA by enzymatic depolymerization; however, the structure of PgdS is still unknown. Here, to study in detail the full-length PgdS structure, we analyze the low-resolution architecture of PgdS hydrolase from Bacillus subtilis in solution using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) method. Combining with other methods, like dynamic light scattering and mutagenesis analyses, a model for the full length structure and the possible substrate delivery route of PgdS are proposed. The results will provide useful hints for future investigations into the mechanisms of ?-PGA degradation by the PgdS hydrolase and may provide valuable practical information."
"Reactive electrophile species (RES), including prostaglandins, phytoprostanes and 12-oxo phytodienoic acid (OPDA), activate detoxification responses in plants and animals. However, the pathways leading to the activation of defense reactions related to abiotic or biotic stress as a function of RES formation, accumulation or treatment are poorly understood in plants. Here, the thiol-modification of proteins, including the RES-activated basic region/leucine zipper transcription factor TGA2, was studied. TGA2 contains a single cysteine residue (Cys186) that was covalently modified by reactive cyclopentenones but not required for induction of detoxification genes in response to OPDA or prostaglandin A1. Activation of the glutathione-S-transferase 6 (GST6) promoter was responsive to cyclopentenones but not to unreactive cyclopentanones, including jasmonic acid suggesting that thiol reactivity of RES is important to activate the TGA2-dependent signaling pathway resulting in GST6 activation We show that RES modify thiols in numerous proteins in vivo, however, thiol reactivity alone appears not to be sufficient for biological activity as demonstrated by the failure of several membrane permeable thiol reactive reagents to activate the GST6 promoter."
"Instulator proteins are central to domain organization and gene regulation in the genome. We used ectopic tethering of CHROMATOR (CHRIZ/CHRO) and dCTCF to pre-defined regions of the genome to dissect the influence of these proteins on local chromatin organization, to analyze their interaction with other key chromatin proteins and to evaluate the effects on transcription and replication. Specifically, using UAS-GAL4DBD system, CHRO and dCTCF were artificially recruited into highly compacted polytene chromosome bands that share the features of silent chromatin type known as intercalary heterochromatin (IH). This led to local chromatin decondensation, formation of novel DHSes and recruitment of several ""open chromatin"" proteins. CHRO tethering resulted in the recruitment of CP190 and Z4 (PZG), whereas dCTCF tethering attracted CHRO, CP190, and Z4. Importantly, formation of a local stretch of open chromatin did not result in the reactivation of silent marker genes yellow and mini-white immediately adjacent to the targeting region (UAS), nor did RNA polII become recruited into this chromatin. The decompacted region retained late replicated, similarly to the wild-type untargeted region."
"Despite increasing ability to store and analyze large amounts of data for organismal and ecological studies, the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images has largely remained time consuming and error-prone, particularly for tasks for which automation is difficult or impossible. Improving the efficiency of these tasks, which allows for more high quality data to be collected in a shorter amount of time, is therefore a high priority. The open-source web application, webpic, implements common web languages and widely available libraries and productivity apps to streamline the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images. In this paper, I introduce the framework of webpic and demonstrate one readily available feature of this application, linear measurements, using fossil leaf specimens. This application fills the gap between workflows accomplishable by individuals through existing software and those accomplishable by large, unmoderated crowds. It demonstrates that flexible web languages can be used to streamline time-intensive research tasks without the use of specialized equipment or proprietary software and highlights the potential for web resources to facilitate data collection in research tasks and outreach activities with improved efficiency."
"Thorough understanding of biodiversity is a fundamental prerequisite for biological research. A lack of taxonomic knowledge and species misidentifications are particularly critical for conservation. Here we present an example of Potamogeton floridanus, the Florida Pondweed, an endangered taxon endemic to a small area in the Florida panhandle, whose taxonomic status remained controversial for more than a century, and all previous attempts to elucidate its identity have failed. We applied molecular approaches to tackle the origin of the mysterious taxon and supplemented them with morphological and anatomical investigations of both historical herbarium collections and plants recently collected in the type area for a comprehensive taxonomic reassessment. Sequencing of two nuclear ribosomal markers and one chloroplast non-coding spacer resulted in the surprising discovery that P. floridanus is a hybrid of P. pulcher and P. oakesianus, with the former being the maternal parent. The hybrid colony is currently geographically isolated from the distribution range of P. oakesianus. We show that previous molecular analyses have failed to reveal its hybrid identity due to inadequate nuclear DNA sequence editing. This is an example how the uncritical use of automized sequence reads can hamper molecular species identifications and also affect phylogenetic tree construction and interpretation. This unique hybrid taxon, P. ×floridanus, adds another case study to the debate on hybrid protection; consequences for its conservation are discussed."
"Chagas disease also known as American trypanosomiasis is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Over the last 30 years, Chagas disease has expanded from a neglected parasitic infection of the rural population to an urbanized chronic disease, becoming a potentially emergent global health problem. T. cruzi strains were assigned to seven genetic groups (TcI-TcVI and TcBat), named discrete typing units (DTUs), which represent a set of isolates that differ in virulence, pathogenicity and immunological features. Indeed, diverse clinical manifestations (from asymptomatic to highly severe disease) have been attempted to be related to T.cruzi genetic variability. Due to that, several DTU typing methods have been introduced. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks such as high complexity and analysis time and all of them are based on genetic signatures. Recently, a novel method discriminated bacterial strains using a peptide identification-free, genome sequence-independent shotgun proteomics workflow. Here, we aimed to develop a Trypanosoma cruzi Strain Typing Assay using MS/MS peptide spectral libraries, named Tc-STAMS2.The Tc-STAMS2 method uses shotgun proteomics combined with spectral library search to assign and discriminate T. cruzi strains independently on the genome knowledge. The method is based on the construction of a library of MS/MS peptide spectra built using genotyped T. cruzi reference strains. For identification, the MS/MS peptide spectra of unknown T. cruzi cells are identified using the spectral matching algorithm SpectraST. The Tc-STAMS2 method allowed correct identification of all DTUs with high confidence. The method was robust towards different sample preparations, length of chromatographic gradients and fragmentation techniques. Moreover, a pilot inter-laboratory study showed the applicability to different MS platforms.This is the first study that develops a MS-based platform for T. cruzi strain typing. Indeed, the Tc-STAMS2 method allows T. cruzi strain typing using MS/MS spectra as discriminatory features and allows the differentiation of TcI-TcVI DTUs. Similar to genomic-based strategies, the Tc-STAMS2 method allows identification of strains within DTUs. Its robustness towards different experimental and biological variables makes it a valuable complementary strategy to the current T. cruzi genotyping assays. Moreover, this method can be used to identify DTU-specific features correlated with the strain phenotype."
"Intracellular traffic in Aspergillus nidulans hyphae must cope with the challenges that the high rates of apical extension (1?m/min) and the long intracellular distances (>100 ?m) impose. Understanding the ways in which the hyphal tip cell coordinates traffic to meet these challenges is of basic importance, but is also of considerable applied interest, as fungal invasiveness of animals and plants depends critically upon maintaining these high rates of growth. Rapid apical extension requires localization of cell-wall-modifying enzymes to hyphal tips. By combining genetic blocks in different trafficking steps with multidimensional epifluorescence microscopy and quantitative image analyses we demonstrate that polarization of the essential chitin-synthase ChsB occurs by indirect endocytic recycling, involving delivery/exocytosis to apices followed by internalization by the sub-apical endocytic collar of actin patches and subsequent trafficking to TGN cisternae, where it accumulates for ~1 min before being re-delivered to the apex by a RAB11/TRAPPII-dependent pathway. Accordingly, ChsB is stranded at the TGN by Sec7 inactivation but re-polarizes to the apical dome if the block is bypassed by a mutation in geaAgea1 that restores growth in the absence of Sec7. That polarization is independent of RAB5, that ChsB predominates at apex-proximal cisternae, and that upon dynein impairment ChsB is stalled at the tips in an aggregated endosome indicate that endocytosed ChsB traffics to the TGN via sorting endosomes functionally located upstream of the RAB5 domain and that this step requires dynein-mediated basipetal transport. It also requires RAB6 and its effector GARP (Vps51/Vps52/Vps53/Vps54), whose composition we determined by MS/MS following affinity chromatography purification. Ablation of any GARP component diverts ChsB to vacuoles and impairs growth and morphology markedly, emphasizing the important physiological role played by this pathway that, we propose, is central to the hyphal mode of growth."
"Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease, a major public health problem throughout Latin America. There is no vaccine and the only drugs have severe side effects. Efforts to generate new therapies are hampered by limitations in our understanding of parasite biology and disease pathogenesis. Studies are compromised by the complexity of the disease, the long-term nature of the infection, and the fact that parasites are barely detectable during the chronic stage. In addition, functional dissection of T. cruzi biology has been restricted by the limited flexibility of the genetic manipulation technology applicable to this parasite.Here, we describe two technical innovations, which will allow the role of the parasite in disease progression to be better assessed. First, we generated a T. cruzi reporter strain that expresses a fusion protein comprising red-shifted luciferase and green fluorescent protein domains. Bioluminescence allows the kinetics of infection to be followed within a single animal, and specific foci of infection to be pinpointed in excised tissues. Fluorescence can then be used to visualise individual parasites in tissue sections to study host-parasite interactions at a cellular level. Using this strategy, we have been routinely able to find individual parasites within chronically infected murine tissues for the first time. The second advance is the incorporation of a streamlined CRISPR/Cas9 functionality into this reporter strain that can facilitate genome editing using a PCR-based approach that does not require DNA cloning. This system allows the rapid generation of null mutants and fluorescently tagged parasites in a background where the in vivo phenotype can be rapidly assessed.The techniques described here will have multiple applications for studying aspects of T. cruzi biology and Chagas disease pathogenesis previously inaccessible to conventional approaches. The reagents and cell lines have been generated as a community resource and are freely available on request."
"Homologous recombination is central to repair DNA double-strand breaks, either accidently arising in mitotic cells or in a programed manner at meiosis. Crossovers resulting from the repair of meiotic breaks are essential for proper chromosome segregation and increase genetic diversity of the progeny. However, mechanisms regulating crossover formation remain elusive. Here, we identified through genetic and protein-protein interaction screens FIDGETIN-LIKE-1 INTERACTING PROTEIN (FLIP) as a new partner of the previously characterized anti-crossover factor FIDGETIN-LIKE-1 (FIGL1) in Arabidopsis thaliana. We showed that FLIP limits meiotic crossover together with FIGL1. Further, FLIP and FIGL1 form a protein complex conserved from Arabidopsis to human. FIGL1 interacts with the recombinases RAD51 and DMC1, the enzymes that catalyze the DNA strand exchange step of homologous recombination. Arabidopsis flip mutants recapitulate the figl1 phenotype, with enhanced meiotic recombination associated with change in counts of DMC1 and RAD51 foci. Our data thus suggests that FLIP and FIGL1 form a conserved complex that regulates the crucial step of strand invasion in homologous recombination."
"Zinc is an essential micronutrient for all living organisms and is involved in a plethora of processes including growth and development, and immunity. However, it is unknown if there is a common genetic and molecular basis underlying multiple facets of zinc function. Here we used natural variation in Arabidopsis thaliana to study the role of zinc in regulating growth. We identify allelic variation of the systemic immunity gene AZI1 as a key for determining root growth responses to low zinc conditions. We further demonstrate that this gene is important for modulating primary root length depending on the zinc and defence status. Finally, we show that the interaction of the immunity signal azelaic acid and zinc level to regulate root growth is conserved in rice. This work demonstrates that there is a common genetic and molecular basis for multiple zinc dependent processes and that nutrient cues can determine the balance of plant growth and immune responses in plants."
"Molting is an essential process in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans during which the epidermal apical extracellular matrix, termed the cuticle, is detached and replaced at each larval stage. The conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2/NEK8/NEK9 and NEKL-3/NEK6/NEK7, together with their ankyrin repeat partners, MLT-2/ANKS6, MLT-3/ANKS3, and MLT-4/INVS, are essential for normal molting. In nekl and mlt mutants, the old larval cuticle fails to be completely shed, leading to entrapment and growth arrest. To better understand the molecular and cellular functions of NEKLs during molting, we isolated genetic suppressors of nekl molting-defective mutants. Using two independent approaches, we identified CDC-42, a conserved Rho-family GTPase, and its effector protein kinase, SID-3/ACK1. Notably, CDC42 and ACK1 regulate actin dynamics in mammals, and actin reorganization within the worm epidermis has been proposed to be important for the molting process. Inhibition of NEKL-MLT activities led to strong defects in the distribution of actin and failure to form molting-specific apical actin bundles. Importantly, this phenotype was reverted following cdc-42 or sid-3 inhibition. In addition, repression of CDC-42 or SID-3 also suppressed nekl-associated defects in trafficking, a process that requires actin assembly and disassembly. Expression analyses indicated that components of the NEKL-MLT network colocalize with both actin and CDC-42 in specific regions of the epidermis. Moreover, NEKL-MLT components were required for the normal subcellular localization of CDC-42 in the epidermis as well as wild-type levels of CDC-42 activation. Taken together, our findings indicate that the NEKL-MLT network regulates actin through CDC-42 and its effector SID-3. Interestingly, we also observed that downregulation of CDC-42 in a wild-type background leads to molting defects, suggesting that there is a fine balance between NEKL-MLT and CDC-42-SID-3 activities in the epidermis."
"The broadly conserved signaling nucleotide cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is essential for viability in most bacteria where it has been studied. However, characterization of the cellular functions and metabolism of c-di-AMP has largely been confined to the class Bacilli, limiting our functional understanding of the molecule among diverse phyla. We identified the cyclase responsible for c-di-AMP synthesis and characterized the molecule's role in survival of darkness in the model photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. In addition to the use of traditional genetic, biochemical, and proteomic approaches, we developed a high-throughput genetic interaction screen (IRB-Seq) to determine pathways where the signaling nucleotide is active. We found that in S. elongatus c-di-AMP is produced by an enzyme of the diadenylate cyclase family, CdaA, which was previously unexplored experimentally. A cdaA-null mutant experiences increased oxidative stress and death during the nighttime portion of day-night cycles, in which potassium transport is implicated. These findings suggest that c-di-AMP is biologically active in cyanobacteria and has non-canonical roles in the phylum including oxidative stress management and day-night survival. The pipeline and analysis tools for IRB-Seq developed for this study constitute a quantitative high-throughput approach for studying genetic interactions."
"Human GWAS of obesity have been successful in identifying loci associated with adiposity, but for the most part, these are non-coding SNPs whose function, or even whose gene of action, is unknown. To help identify the genes on which these human BMI loci may be operating, we conducted a high throughput screen in Drosophila Melanogaster. Starting with 78 BMI loci from two recently published GWAS meta-analyses, we identified fly orthologs of all nearby genes (± 250KB). We crossed RNAi knockdown lines of each gene with flies containing tissue-specific drivers to knock down (KD) the expression of the genes only in the brain and the fat body. We then raised the flies on a control diet and compared the amount of fat/triglyceride in the tissue-specific KD group compared to the driver-only control flies. 16 of the 78 BMI GWAS loci could not be screened with this approach, as no gene in the 500-kb region had a fly ortholog. Of the remaining 62 GWAS loci testable in the fly, we found a significant fat phenotype in the KD flies for at least one gene for 26 loci (42%) even after correcting for multiple comparisons. By contrast, the rate of significant fat phenotypes in RNAi KD found in a recent genome-wide Drosophila screen (Pospisilik et al. (2010) is ~5%. More interestingly, for 10 of the 26 positive regions, we found that the nearest gene was not the one that showed a significant phenotype in the fly. Specifically, our screen suggests that for the 10 human BMI SNPs rs11057405, rs205262, rs9925964, rs9914578, rs2287019, rs11688816, rs13107325, rs7164727, rs17724992, and rs299412, the functional genes may NOT be the nearest ones (CLIP1, C6orf106, KAT8, SMG6, QPCTL, EHBP1, SLC39A8, ADPGK /ADPGK-AS1, PGPEP1, KCTD15, respectively), but instead, the specific nearby cis genes are the functional target (namely: ZCCHC8, VPS33A, RSRC2; SPDEF, NUDT3; PAGR1; SETD1, VKORC1; SGSM2, SRR; VASP, SIX5; OTX1; BANK1; ARIH1; ELL; CHST8, respectively). The study also suggests further functional experiments to elucidate mechanism of action for genes evolutionarily conserved for fat storage."
"The throughput of cell mechanical characterization has recently approached that of conventional flow cytometers. However, this very sensitive, label-free approach still lacks the specificity of molecular markers. Here we developed an approach that combines real-time 1D-imaging fluorescence and deformability cytometry in one instrument (RT-FDC), thus opening many new research avenues. We demonstrated its utility by using subcellular fluorescence localization to identify mitotic cells and test for mechanical changes in those cells in an RNA interference screen."
"During sepsis, the early innate response and inflammatory cytokine cascade are associated with activation of the coagulation cascade. Acute hypercoagulability can contribute to lethal sequela of vascular thrombosis, tissue ischemia, and organ failure. We investigated if amitriptyline (AMIT), an antidepressant drug with a number of anti-inflammatory effects, could ameliorate sepsis in a murine model of sepsis - cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). We hypothesized that AMIT treatment would reduce inflammation and mitigate sepsis-induced coagulopathy. Coagulation was measured using thromboelastometry and ferric chloride-induced carotid artery thrombosis. Our findings demonstrate a dynamic early hypercoagulability, followed by delayed hypocoagulability in septic mice. However, septic mice treated with AMIT were unaffected by these coagulation changes and exhibited a coagulation profile similar to sham mice. TNF? was markedly elevated in septic mice, but decreased in AMIT-treated mice. Exogenous administration of recombinant TNF? in naïve mice recapitulated the acute sepsis-induced hypercoagulability profile. Following sepsis and endotoxemia, peritoneal macrophages were the predominant source of TNF? expression. AMIT treatment significantly decreased macrophage TNF? expression and blunted M1 polarization. Altogether, during polymicrobial sepsis, AMIT treatment suppressed macrophage TNF? expression and the M1 phenotype, mitigating an initial hypercoagulable state, and protecting septic mice from delayed hypocoagulability. We propose that AMIT treatment is a promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of sepsis-associated coagulopathy and prevention of acute thromboembolic events or delayed bleeding complications."
"Severe sepsis is critical to health and can result in acute renal failure (ARF). Tissue factor (TF) and thrombomodulin (TM) play key roles in vascular endothelial functions by helping maintain microcirculation in the kidney. Budding uninhibited by benzimidazole-1 (Bub1) plays a role in Akt and JNK signaling, which control TF and TM, respectively. We hypothesized that Bub1 could control vascular endothelial function in sepsis. The aim of this study was to determine the role of Bub1 in septic ARF. We used Mouse cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) using low Bub1 expressing (Bub1) and wild-type (Bub1) mice in vivo and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) in vitro. Bub1 mice had a higher survival rate after CLP than Bub1. Bub1 mice had more severe ARF after CLP than Bub1 with blood biochemical and pathological analyses. TF expression in Bub1 mice and control HAEC (control) significantly increased in the septic model compared with Bub1 and Bub1 silenced HAEC (siBub1). TM expression in the control significantly decreased after LPS stimulation compared with siBub1. Akt and JNK phosphorylation of siBub1 were attenuated after LPS stimulation. Associations of Bub1 with Akt or JNK after LPS stimulation of HAEC were detected using immunoprecipitation, suggesting that Bub1 is involved in the phosphorylation of Akt and JNK after LPS stimulation. Bub1 insufficiency attenuates TF expression and reduces TM suppression by blocking Akt and JNK phosphorylation, respectively, thus leading to the prevention of ARF and death caused by sepsis."
"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produce mature blood cells throughout lifetime. Natural genetic diversity offers an important yet largely untapped reservoir for deciphering regulatory mechanisms of HSCs and hematopoiesis. In this review, we explore the role of latexin, identified by natural variation, in regulating homeostatic and stress hematopoiesis, unravel the underlying signaling pathways, and propose its therapeutic implication.Latexin acts endogenously in HSCs to negatively regulate their population size by enhancing apoptosis and by decreasing self-renewal. Deletion of latexin in vivo increases HSC repopulation capacity and survival, expands the entire hematopoietic system, and mitigates myelosuppression. Latexin inactivation downregulates thrombospondin 1 (Thbs1). It inhibits nuclear translocation of ribosomal protein subunit 3 (Rps3), a novel latexin-binding protein, and sensitizes hematopoietic cells to radiation-induced cell death. However, how latexin-Rps3 pathway regulates Thbs1 transcription is unclear. Latexin is downregulated in cancer cells because of promoter hypermethylation, but latexin-depleted mice do not inherently develop hematologic malignancies even with aging. The mechanism of action of latexin in tumorigenesis remains largely unknown.Understanding how latexin regulates HSC survival, self-renewal, and stress response will advance our knowledge of HSC biology. It will facilitate the development of a novel therapeutic strategy for hematopoietic regeneration and cancer treatment."
"Multiple factors are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection related cervical anomalies and its progression to cervical carcinoma (CaCx), but data vary with respect to the underlying HPV genotype and with population being studied. No data are available regarding the role of immunological imbalance in HPV infected CaCx pathogenesis from Northeast India, which has an ethnically distinct population, and was aimed to be addressed through this study. The study included 76 CaCx cases, 25 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) cases, and 50 healthy female controls. HPV screening and genotyping were performed by PCR. Differential expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?) was studied at serum level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and tissue level by immunohistochemistry and messenger RNA (mRNA) level by real-time PCR. The data were correlated with interferon gamma (IFN-?) and NF-??p65 levels at protein level, as well as HPV16 E6 and E7 expression at transcript level statistically. HPV infection and HPV16 genotype were predominant in the studied cohort. TNF-? was found to be downregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in CaCx cases compared to controls; and the gradient downregulation correlated with progression of the disease from normal?CIN?CaCx. TNF-? expression correlated with insufficient modulation of both IFN-? and NF-??p65. The HPV16 E6 and E7 transcripts were found to be sharply upregulated in CaCx cases strongly inversely correlated with the TNF-? expression. Significant role of TNF-? downregulation associated with insufficient IFN-? and total NF-??p65 modulation and the resulting significant upregulation of viral transcripts E6 and E7 are key to the HPV16 infection mediated CaCx pathogenesis in northeast Indian patients."
"Chemokines play a key role in immune regulation and response, and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis (TB). In this study, we investigated whether functional polymorphisms of the chemokines CCL5, CCL2, and CXCL8 are associated with pulmonary TB in a Moldavian population.A total of 250 patients with TB and 184 healthy controls were screened for CCL5 -403G/A (rs2107538), CCL5 In1.1T/C (rs2280789), CCL2 -2518A/G (rs1024611), and CXCL8 -251A/T (rs4073) polymorphisms using standard polymerase chain reaction techniques.None of the analyzed variants were found to be significantly associated with overall pulmonary TB susceptibility. However, the CCL5 In1.1T/C polymorphism was significantly associated with early-onset TB in patients younger than 30 (dominant model, odds ratio [OR]?=?3.01, p?=?0.0046) or younger than 40 years (dominant model, OR?=?2.17, p?=?0.0099), and the conducted case-only analysis demonstrated that CCL5 In1.1T/C C-allele carriers exhibited an earlier TB onset than TT homozygotes (36.14 years vs. 40.13 years, p?=?0.0065). In addition, nominal significance was observed for an association between TB incidence and both the eight paired genotypes in the overall patient cohort (0.017 < p?<?0.05) and the CCL2 -2518A/G polymorphism among males (dominant model, OR?=?0.55, p?=?0.041; log-additive model, OR?=?0.57, p?=?0.018).The CCL5 In1.1T/C polymorphism may modulate pulmonary early-onset TB risk."
"miR-27b is reported to participate in the proliferation and differentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and to regulate fat metabolism of rat HSCs by targeting retinoid X receptor ?. Our previous study also indicated that the recombinant P40 protein from Schistosoma japonicum (rSjP40) inhibited the activation of HSCs. In this study, we observed the expression of miR-27b in rSjP40-treated LX-2 cells and explored its potential mechanisms. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that rSjP40 inhibits the expression of miR-27b in LX-2 cells. Further results obtained by Western blot and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-27b regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?) expression in rSjP40-treated LX-2 cells by targeting the 3'-UTR of PPAR?. 5-AZA-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC), which inhibits methylation of HSCs, partially reversed rSjP40-induced down-regulation expression of miR-27b in LX-2 cells. 5-AZA-dC also partially reversed rSjP40-induced up-regulation expression of PPAR? in LX-2 cells. The increased expression of PPAR? in rSjP40-treated LX-2 cells may be partially due to miR-27b methylation. Therefore, our study provides further insight into the mechanism by which rSjP40 inhibits HSC activation and provides a basis for future study of the blocking effect of rSjP40 in liver fibrosis.-Zhu, D., Lyu, L., Shen, P., Wang, J., Chen, J., Sun, X., Chen, L., Zhang, L., Zhou, Q., Duan, Y. rSjP40 protein promotes PPAR? expression in LX-2 cells through microRNA-27b."
"Conventional metabolomic methods include extensive sample preparation steps and long analytical run times, increasing the likelihood of processing artifacts and limiting high throughput applications. We present here in vitro liquid extraction surface analysis mass spectrometry (ivLESA-MS), a variation on LESA-MS, performed directly on adherent cells grown in 96-well cell culture plates. To accomplish this, culture medium was aspirated immediately prior to analysis, and metabolites were extracted using LESA from the cell monolayer surface, followed by nano-electrospray ionization and MS analysis in negative ion mode. We applied this platform to characterize and compare lipidomic profiles of multiple breast cancer cell lines growing in culture (MCF-7, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-231) and revealed distinct and reproducible lipidomic signatures between the cell lines. Additionally, we demonstrated time-dependent processing artifacts, underscoring the importance of immediate analysis. ivLESA-MS represents a rapid in vitro metabolomic method, which precludes the need for quenching, cell harvesting, sample preparation, and chromatography, significantly shortening preparation and analysis time while minimizing processing artifacts. This method could be further adapted to test drugs in vitro in a high throughput manner."
"A piezoresistive sensor based on ultralight and superelastic aerogel is reported to fabricate MXene/reduced graphene oxide (MX/rGO) hybrid 3D structures and utilize their pressure-sensitive characteristics. The MX/rGO aerogel not only combines the rGO's large specific surface area and the MXene's (Ti3C2Tx) high conductivity but also exhibits rich porous structure, which leads to performance better than that of single-component rGO or MXene in terms of the pressure sensor. The large nanosheets of rGO can prevent the poor oxidization of MXene by wrapping MXene inside the aerogel. More importantly, the piezoresistive sensor based on the MX/rGO aerogel shows extremely high sensitivity (22.56 kPa-1), fast response time (<200 ms), and good stability over 10?000 cycles. The piezoresistive sensor based on the MX/rGO hybrid 3D aerogel can easily capture the signal below 10 Pa, thus clearly testing the pulse of an adult at random. Based on its superior performance, it also demonstrates potential applications in measuring pressure distribution, distinguishing subtle strain, and monitoring healthy activity."
"Functionalization of nanocrystals is essential for their practical application, but synthesis on nanocrystal surfaces is limited by incompatibilities with certain key reagents. The copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition is among the most useful methods for ligating molecules to surfaces, but has been largely useless for semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) because Cu+ions quickly and irreversibly quench QD fluorescence. To discover nonquenching synthetic conditions for Cu-catalyzed click reactions on QD surfaces, we developed a combinatorial fluorescence assay to screen >2000 reaction conditions to maximize cycloaddition efficiency while minimizing QD quenching. We identify conditions for complete coupling without significant quenching, which are compatible with common QD polymer surfaces and various azide/alkyne pairs. Based on insight from the combinatorial screen and mechanistic studies of Cu coordination and quenching, we find that superstoichiometric concentrations of Cu can promote full coupling if accompanied by ligands that selectively compete with the Cu from the QD surface but allow it to remain catalytically active. Applied to the conjugation of a K+channel-specific peptidyl toxin to CdSe/ZnS QDs, we synthesize unquenched QD conjugates and image their specific and voltage-dependent affinity for K+channels in live cells."
"Lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs) are reactive metabolites, which can covalently modify proteins and DNA and regulate diverse cellular processes. 2- trans-Hexadecenal (2-HD) is a byproduct of sphingolipid metabolism, involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, DNA damage, and apoptosis. In addition, the loss of ALDH3A2, an enzyme removing 2-HD in cells, is responsible for Sjörgen-Larsson Syndrome (SJS), suggesting that accumulation of 2-HD could lead to pathogenesis. However, the targets and the precise mechanisms of 2-HD are not well characterized. Herein, we report an alkyne-2-HD derivative as a bioorthogonal probe to explore the functions of 2-HD. We identified more than 500 potential cellular targets. Among them, the pro-apoptotic protein Bax can be covalently modified by 2-HD directly at the conserved Cys62 residue. Our work provided new chemical tools to explore the cellular functions of LDEs and revealed new mechanistic insights of the deregulation of lipid metabolism in diseases."
"Epidemiological, biological, and molecular data suggest links between endometriosis and endometrial cancer, with recent epidemiological studies providing evidence for an association between a previous diagnosis of endometriosis and risk of endometrial cancer. We used genetic data as an alternative approach to investigate shared biological etiology of these two diseases. Genetic correlation analysis of summary level statistics from genomewide association studies (GWAS) using LD Score regression revealed moderate but significant genetic correlation (rg = 0.23, P = 9.3 × 10-3), and SNP effect concordance analysis provided evidence for significant SNP pleiotropy (P = 6.0 × 10-3) and concordance in effect direction (P = 2.0 × 10-3) between the two diseases. Cross-disease GWAS meta-analysis highlighted 13 distinct loci associated at P ? 10-5with both endometriosis and endometrial cancer, with one locus (SNP rs2475335) located within PTPRD associated at a genomewide significant level (P = 4.9 × 10-8, OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.07-1.15). PTPRD acts in the STAT3 pathway, which has been implicated in both endometriosis and endometrial cancer. This study demonstrates the value of cross-disease genetic analysis to support epidemiological observations and to identify biological pathways of relevance to multiple diseases."
"Cervical microbiota composition is associated with cervical HPV infection and CIN severity. Previous studies only assessed the total association between cervical microbiota and HPV infections or CINs, and yet no study reported the direct and indirect associations between cervical microbiota and CINs mediated by HPV infection, respectively. The aim of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect associations between microbiotas and CIN severity. Cervical microbiota of 126 women with CIN 1- (normal cytology and CIN 1) and 40 with CIN 2+ (CIN 2 and CIN 3) were analyzed using Illumina sequencing based on the 16S rRNA gene. HPV was detected using a highly sensitive PCR primer set (SPF1/GP6+). Indirect effects of Pseudomonas stutzeri, Bacteroides fragilis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Atopobium vaginae, and Streptococcus agalactiae mediated by HPV infection on CIN status were observed. The directions of the direct and the indirect associations between CIN status and Ps. stutzeri were opposite. The directions of the direct and the indirect associations between CIN status and A. vaginae were the same. B. fragilis, L. delbrueckii, and S. agalactiae only had indirect association with CIN status. In summary, our study provided suggestive evidence that some microbial populations could have direct or indirect effects mediated by affecting HPV infection on CIN progression. Besides HPV infection, microbial community composition possibly plays a role in cervical carcinogenesis."
"Autophagy and unfolded protein response (UPR) appear to be important for skeletal muscle homeostasis and may be altered by exercise. Our aim was to investigate the effects of resistance exercise and training on indicators of UPR and autophagy in healthy untrained young men (n = 12, 27 ± 4 years) and older men (n = 8, 61 ± 6 years) as well as in resistance-trained individuals (n = 15, 25 ± 5 years).Indicators of autophagy and UPR were investigated from the muscle biopsies after a single resistance exercise bout and after 21 weeks of resistance training.Lipidated LC3II as an indicator of autophagosome content increased at 48 hours post resistance exercise (P < 0.05) and after a resistance-training period (P < 0.01) in untrained young men but not in older men. Several UPRERmarkers, typically induced by protein misfolding in endoplasmic reticulum, were increased at 48 hours post resistance exercise in untrained young and older men (P < 0.05) but were unaltered after the 21-week resistance-training period regardless of age. UPR was unchanged within the first few hours after the resistance exercise bout regardless of the training status. Changes in autophagy and UPRERindicators did not correlate with a resistance-training-induced increase in muscle strength and size.Autophagosome content is increased by resistance training in young previously untrained men, but this response may be blunted by aging. However, unfolded protein response is induced by an unaccustomed resistance exercise bout in a delayed manner regardless of age. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
"Tick-borne Babesia parasites are responsible for costly diseases worldwide. Improved control and prevention tools are urgently needed, but development of such tools is limited by numerous gaps in knowledge of the parasite-host relationships. We hereby used atomic force microscopy (AFM) and frequency-modulated Kelvin probe potential microscopy (FM-KPFM) techniques to compare size, texture, roughness and surface potential of normal and infected Babesia bovis, B. bigemina and B. caballi erythrocytes to better understand the physical properties of these parasites. In addition, AFM and FM-KPFM allowed a detailed view of extraerythrocytic merozoites revealing shape, topography and surface potential of paired and single parasites. B. bovis-infected erythrocytes display distinct surface texture and overall roughness compared to noninfected erythrocytes. Interestingly, B. caballi-infected erythrocytes do not display the surface ridges typical in B. bovis parasites. Observations of extraerythrocytic B. bovis, B. bigemina and B. caballi merozoites using AFM revealed differences in size and shape between these three parasites. Finally, similar to what was previously observed for Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes, FM-KPFM images reveal an unequal electric charge distribution, with higher surface potential above the erythrocyte regions that are likely associated with Babesia parasites than over its remainder regions. In addition, the surface potential of paired extraerythrocytic B. bovis Mo7 merozoites revealed an asymmetric potential distribution. These observations may be important to better understand the unique cytoadhesive properties of B. bovis-infected erythrocytes, and to speculate on the role of differences in the distribution of surface charges in the biology of the parasites."
"Polyploids are predicted to have greater niche breadth and larger ranges than diploids because of higher ecological tolerances, self-compatibility, and increased genetic variation. However, empirical support for this prediction is mixed, and most studies compare diploids and polyploids, rather than accounting for quantitative variation in ploidy. We test the prediction that species of higher ploidy have greater range breadth and abiotic breadth than those of lower ploidy.We estimate range breadth (latitudinal range, altitudinal range, and range size) and abiotic breadth (range in temperature, precipitation, and ultraviolet-B irradiance) for 109 species in the Potentilleae tribe of Rosaceae. We assess the contribution of ploidy to variation in range breadth, while accounting for shared evolutionary history and time of species divergence using phylogenetic comparative methods.Ploidy varied widely among species from 2× to 12×. Phylogenetic relatedness explained little of the variation in ploidy, range breadth, and abiotic breadth. Transitions to higher ploidy were associated with reduced latitudinal and altitudinal ranges, smaller overall range size, and reduced abiotic breadth for temperature and UV-B.In contrast to predictions, this study shows that transitions to higher ploidy are associated with reduced range size and abiotic breadth. It also highlights the importance of considering continuous variation in ploidy when evaluating ecological correlates with ploidy. We discuss how genome duplication may contribute to the observed negative relationship between ploidy and range breadth."
"                    Background:
                    Bemisia tabaci
species (B. tabaci), or whiteflies, are the world's most devastating insect pests. They cause billions of dollars (US) of damage each year, and are leaving farmers in the developing world food insecure. Currently, all publically available transcriptome data forB. tabaciare generated from pooled samples, which can lead to high heterozygosity and skewed representation of the genetic diversity. The ability to extract enough RNA from a single whitefly has remained elusive due to their small size and technological limitations.Methods:In this study, we optimised a single whitefly RNA extraction procedure, and sequenced the transcriptome of four individual adult Sub-Saharan Africa 1 (SSA1)B. tabaci.Transcriptome sequencing resulted in 39-42 million raw reads.De novoassembly of trimmed reads yielded between 65,000-162,000 Contigs acrossB. tabacitranscriptomes.Results:Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrion cytochrome I oxidase (mtCOI) grouped the four whiteflies within the SSA1 clade. BLASTn searches on the four transcriptomes identified five endosymbionts; the primary endosymbiontPortieraaleyrodidarumand four secondary endosymbionts:Arsenophonus, Wolbachia, Rickettsia,andCardinium spp.that were predominant across all four SSA1 B.tabacisamples with prevalence levels of between 54.1 to 75%. Amino acid alignments of theNusG gene ofP. aleyrodidarumfor the SSA1B. tabacitranscriptomes of samples WF2 and WF2b revealed an eleven amino acid residue deletion that was absent in samples WF1 and WF2a. Comparison of the protein structure of theNusG protein fromP. aleyrodidarumin SSA1 with knownNusG structures showed the deletion resulted in a shorter D loop.Conclusions:The use of field-collected specimens means time and money will be saved in future studies using single whitefly transcriptomes in monitoring vector and viral interactions. Our method is applicable to any small organism where RNA quantity has limited transcriptome studies."
"Because no approved medications exist for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), patients must use off-label drugs or create their own formulations. We assessed the efficacy of a standardized compounded budesonide suspension for treatment of EoE.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of EoE patients at the University of North Carolina treated with compounded budesonide dispensed by a specialty compounding pharmacy. Outcomes (symptomatic global response [yes/no], endoscopic response [% with individual findings], and histologic response [absolute eosinophil count; % with <15 eos/hpf])were assessed after the initial and last treatment in our system.We identified 48 patients treated with compounded budesonide (mean age 33.6; 69% male; 96% white; 2.4 mg mean initial dose). After a mean length of follow-up of 17.0 months (range: 4.2 - 56.3), there was a significant decrease in symptoms of dysphagia (95% vs. 32%, p < 0.001), improvements in heartburn (37% vs. 11%, p=0.06) and global symptom response (81%). The median of the peak eosinophil counts decreased from 55 to 20 eos/hpf (p<0.001) with 42% achieving a response of <15 eos/hpf. Esophageal candidiasis was rare (6%). In the 18 patients with prior non-response to corticosteroids or dietary elimination, 83% had symptomatic and 38% had histologic response.Compounded budesonide suspension produced a durable symptomatic, endoscopic, and histologic response in a cohort followed for more than a year. Many patients previously refractory to prior therapy responded to compounded budesonide. This formulation can be used clinically until there are approved drugs with esophageal formulations for EoE."
"Computational single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods have been successfully applied to experiments representing a single condition, technology, or species to discover and define cellular phenotypes. However, identifying subpopulations of cells that are present across multiple data sets remains challenging. Here, we introduce an analytical strategy for integrating scRNA-seq data sets based on common sources of variation, enabling the identification of shared populations across data sets and downstream comparative analysis. We apply this approach, implemented in our R toolkit Seurat (http://satijalab.org/seurat/), to align scRNA-seq data sets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced using two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across data sets, while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis. Our approach facilitates general comparisons of scRNA-seq data sets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution."
"The lineage relationships among the hundreds of cell types generated during development are difficult to reconstruct. A recent method, GESTALT, used CRISPR-Cas9 barcode editing for large-scale lineage tracing, but was restricted to early development and did not identify cell types. Here we present scGESTALT, which combines the lineage recording capabilities of GESTALT with cell-type identification by single-cell RNA sequencing. The method relies on an inducible system that enables barcodes to be edited at multiple time points, capturing lineage information from later stages of development. Sequencing of ?60,000 transcriptomes from the juvenile zebrafish brain identified >100 cell types and marker genes. Using these data, we generate lineage trees with hundreds of branches that help uncover restrictions at the level of cell types, brain regions, and gene expression cascades during differentiation. scGESTALT can be applied to other multicellular organisms to simultaneously characterize molecular identities and lineage histories of thousands of cells during development and disease."
"Large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data sets that are produced in different laboratories and at different times contain batch effects that may compromise the integration and interpretation of the data. Existing scRNA-seq analysis methods incorrectly assume that the composition of cell populations is either known or identical across batches. We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. Using multiple droplet-based scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our MNN batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells."
"The lifecycle of Leishmania, the causative agent of leishmaniasis, alternates between promastigote and amastigote stages inside the insect and vertebrate hosts, respectively. While pathogenic symptoms of leishmaniasis can vary widely, from benign cutaneous lesions to highly fatal visceral disease forms depending on the infective species, all Leishmania species reside inside host macrophages during the vertebrate stage of their lifecycle. Leishmania infectivity is therefore directly related to its ability to invade, survive and replicate within parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) inside macrophages. Thus, assessing the parasite's ability to replicate intracellularly serves as a dependable method for determining virulence. Studying leishmaniasis development using animal models is time-consuming, tedious and often difficult, particularly with the pathogenically important visceral forms. We describe here a methodology to follow the intracellular development of Leishmania in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). Intracellular parasite numbers are determined at 24 h intervals for 72 - 96 h following infection. This method allows for a reliable determination of the effects of various genetic factors on Leishmania virulence. As an example, we show how a single allele deletion of the Leishmania Mitochondrial Iron Transporter gene (LMIT1) impairs the ability of the Leishmania amazonensis mutant strain LMIT1/?Lmit1 to grow inside BMMs, reflecting a drastic reduction in virulence compared to wild-type. This assay also allows precise control of experimental conditions, which can be individually manipulated to analyze the influence of various factors (nutrients, reactive oxygen species, etc.) on the host-pathogen interaction. Therefore, the appropriate execution and quantification of BMM infection studies provide a non-invasive, rapid, economical, safe and reliable alternative to conventional animal model studies."
"Mechanisms that involve whole genome polyploidy play important roles in development and evolution; also, an abnormal generation of tetraploid cells has been associated with both the progression of cancer and the development of drug resistance. Until now, it has not been feasible to easily manipulate the ploidy of a multicellular animal without generating mostly sterile progeny. Presented here is a simple and rapid protocol for generating tetraploid Caenorhabditis elegans animals from any diploid strain. This method allows the user to create a bias in chromosome segregation during meiosis, ultimately increasing ploidy in C. elegans. This strategy relies on the transient reduction of expression of the rec-8 gene to generate diploid gametes. A rec-8 mutant produces diploid gametes that can potentially produce tetraploids upon fertilization. This tractable scheme has been used to generate tetraploid strains carrying mutations and chromosome rearrangements to gain insight into chromosomal dynamics and interactions during pairing and synapsis in meiosis. This method is efficient for generating stable tetraploid strains without genetic markers, can be applied to any diploid strain, and can be used to derive triploid C. elegans. This straightforward method is useful for investigating other fundamental biological questions relevant to genome instability, gene dosage, biological scaling, extracellular signaling, adaptation to stress, development of resistance to drugs, and mechanisms of speciation."
"Visualizing the formation of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) from living specimens has been challenging due to the fact that most live imaging techniques require propagation of light through glass, but on glass macrophage fusion is a rare event. This protocol presents the fabrication of several optical-quality glass surfaces where adsorption of compounds containing long-chain hydrocarbons transforms glass into a fusogenic surface. First, preparation of clean glass surfaces as starting material for surface modification is described. Second, a method is provided for the adsorption of compounds containing long-chain hydrocarbons to convert non-fusogenic glass into a fusogenic substrate. Third, this protocol describes fabrication of surface micropatterns that promote a high degree of spatiotemporal control over MGC formation. Finally, fabricating glass bottom dishes is described. Examples of use of this in vitro cell system as a model to study macrophage fusion and MGC formation are shown."
"A defining feature and necessary step of the retrovirus life cycle is the integration of the viral genome into the host genome. All retroviruses encode an integrase (IN) enzyme that catalyzes the covalent joining of viral to host DNA, which is known as strand transfer. Integration may be modeled in vitro with recombinant retroviral IN and DNA oligomers mimicking the ends of the viral genome. In order to more closely recapitulate the integration reaction that occurs in vivo, integration complexes are assembled from recombinant IN and synthetic oligomers by dialysis in a reduced salt concentration buffer. The integration complex, called an intasome, may be purified by size exclusion chromatography. In the case of prototype foamy virus (PFV), the intasome is a tetramer of IN and two DNA oligomers and is readily separated from monomeric IN and free oligomer DNA. The integration efficiency of PFV intasomes may be assayed under a variety of experimental conditions to better understand the dynamics and mechanics of retroviral integration."
"Metastasis is responsible for most cancer deaths. Despite extensive research, the mechanistic understanding of the complex processes governing metastasis remains incomplete. In vivo models are paramount for metastasis research, but require refinement. Tracking spontaneous metastasis by non-invasive in vivo imaging is now possible, but remains challenging as it requires long-time observation and high sensitivity. We describe a longitudinal combined radionuclide and fluorescence whole-body in vivo imaging approach for tracking tumor progression and spontaneous metastasis. This reporter gene methodology employs the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) fused to a fluorescent protein (FP). Cancer cells are engineered to stably express NIS-FP followed by selection based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Corresponding tumor models are established in mice. NIS-FP expressing cancer cells are tracked non-invasively in vivo at the whole-body level by positron emission tomography (PET) using the NIS radiotracer [18F]BF4-. PET is currently the most sensitive in vivo imaging technology available at this scale and enables reliable and absolute quantification. Current methods either rely on large cohorts of animals that are euthanized for metastasis assessment at varying time points, or rely on barely quantifiable 2D imaging. The advantages of the described method are: (i) highly sensitive non-invasive in vivo 3D PET imaging and quantification, (ii) automated PET tracer production, (iii) a significant reduction in required animal numbers due to repeat imaging options, (iv) the acquisition of paired data from subsequent imaging sessions providing better statistical data, and (v) the intrinsic option for ex vivo confirmation of cancer cells in tissues by fluorescence microscopy or cytometry. In this protocol, we describe all steps required for routine NIS-FP-afforded non-invasive in vivo cancer cell tracking using PET/CT and ex vivo confirmation of in vivo results. This protocol has applications beyond cancer research whenever in vivo localization, expansion and long-time monitoring of a cell population is of interest."
"This article describes the experimental procedures used to observe if PRP can positively affect tendon healing. There are 4 main steps to follow: induce a lesion in the Achilles tendon; prepare PRP and inject it (or the saline solution); remove the tendon; and perform biomechanical, molecular, and histological evaluations. At each step, all the procedures and methods are described in detail, so they can be reproduced easily. Achilles tendons have been surgically sectioned (removal of a 5-mm long section). Afterwards, PRP or saline solution was injected to study whether PRP has a positive effect on the healing of the tendon. Three groups of 40 animals (a total of 120 rats were used in this study) were subdivided into 2 subgroups: PRP injection group and a saline injection control group. Rats were sacrificed at increasing time points (Group A: 5 days; Group B: 15 days; Group C: 30 days) and tendons were removed. 90 tendons underwent biomechanical testing before performing transcriptomic analysis and the 30 remaining tendons were submitted to histological analysis."
"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a highly polarized multi-functional epithelium that is located between the neural retina and the choroid of the eye. It is a single sheet of pigmented cells that are hexagonally packed and connected by tight junctions. The main functions of the RPE include absorption of light, phagocytosis of the shed photoreceptor outer segments, spatial buffering of ions, transport of nutrients, ions and water as well as active involvement in the visual cycle. With such important and diverse functions, it is critically important to study the biology of RPE cells. A number of RPE cell lines have been established; however, passaged and immortalized cells are known to quickly lose some of the morphological and physiological characteristics of natural RPE cells. Thus, primary cells are more suitable for studying different aspects of RPE cell biology and function. Mouse primary RPE cell culture is very useful to researchers since mouse models are widely used in biological studies, however collecting RPE cells from mouse is also very challenging due to their small size. Here, we present a protocol for establishing primary mouse RPE cell cultures which includes enucleation and dissection of the eyes and isolation of the RPE sheets to yield the cells for culturing. This method enables efficient cell recovery. The RPE cells obtained from two mice can reach confluency on one 12 mm polyester membrane insert pre-loaded in culture plate after one week of culture and display some of the original properties of bona fide RPE cells such as hexagonal shape and pigmentation after two weeks of culture."
"Osteoclasts are unique bone-resorbing cells that differentiate from the monocyte/macrophage lineage of bone marrow. Dysfunction of osteoclasts may result in a series of bone metabolic diseases, including osteoporosis. To develop pharmaceutical targets for the prevention of pathological bone mass loss, the mechanisms by which osteoclasts differentiate from precursors must be understood. The ability to isolate and culture a large number of osteoclasts in vitro is critical in order to determine the role of specific genes in osteoclast differentiation. Inactivation of the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) in osteoclasts can decrease osteoclast number and increase bone mass; however, the underlying mechanisms require further study. In the present study, a RANKL-based protocol to isolate and culture osteoclasts from mouse bone marrow and to study the influence of mTORC1 inactivation on osteoclast formation is described. This protocol successfully resulted in a large number of giant osteoclasts, typically within one week. Deletion of Raptor impaired osteoclast formation and decreased the activity of secretory tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, indicating that mTORC1 is critical for osteoclast formation."
"This protocol demonstrates the capability of low-field electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-based techniques in combination with functional paramagnetic probes to provide quantitative information on the chemical tumor microenvironment (TME), including pO2, pH, redox status, concentrations of interstitial inorganic phosphate (Pi), and intracellular glutathione (GSH). In particular, an application of a recently developed soluble multifunctional trityl probe provides unsurpassed opportunity for in vivo concurrent measurements of pH, pO2 and Pi in Extracellular space (HOPE probe). The measurements of three parameters using a single probe allow for their correlation analyses independent of probe distribution and time of the measurements."
"Cellular senescence, a major tumor-suppressive cell fate, has emerged from humble beginnings as an in vitro phenomenon into recognition as a fundamental mechanism of aging. In the process, senescent cells have attracted attention as a therapeutic target for age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Given the aging global population and the inadequacy of current medical management, attenuating the health care burden of CVD would be transformative to clinical practice. Here, we review the evidence that cellular senescence drives CVD in a bimodal fashion by both priming the aged cardiovascular system for disease and driving established disease forward. Hence, the growing field of senotherapy (neutralizing senescent cells for therapeutic benefit) is poised to contribute to both prevention and treatment of CVD."
"Hispanic Americans consistently exhibit an intergenerational increase in the prevalence of many noncommunicable chronic physical and mental disorders.We review and synthesize evidence suggesting that a constellation of prenatal and postnatal factors may play crucial roles in explaining this trend. We draw from relevant literature across several disciplines, including epidemiology, anthropology, psychology, medicine (obstetrics, neonatology), and developmental biology.Our resulting model is based on evidence that among women, the process of postmigration cultural adjustment (i.e., acculturation) is associated, during pregnancy and after delivery, with psychological and behavioral states that can affect offspring development in ways that may alter susceptibility to noncommunicable chronic disease risk in subsequent-generation Hispanic Americans. We propose one integrated process model that specifies the biological, behavioral, psychological, and sociocultural pathways by which maternal acculturation may influence the child's long-term health. We synthesize evidence from previous studies to describe how acculturation among Hispanic American mothers is associated with alterations to the same biobehavioral systems known to participate in the processes of prenatal and postnatal developmental programming of disease risk. In this manner, we focus on the concepts of biological and cultural mother-to-child transmission across the prenatal and postnatal life phases. We critique and draw from previous hypotheses that have sought to explain this phenomenon (of declining health across generations). We offer recommendations for examining the transgenerational effects of acculturation.A life course model with a greater focus on maternal health and well-being may be key to understanding transgenerational epidemiological trends in minority populations, and interventions that promote women's wellness may contribute to the elimination or reduction of health disparities."
"The number of pharmacological treatments available for COPD has increased markedly in the last years, mostly corresponding to new agents, combinations and devices within know pharmacological classes. Hierarchizing these options is not straightforward since expected effects are limited by the intrinsically fixed character of the underlying lung damage. In addition, all options have not been directly compared face-to-face. Therefore, guidelines derive from some level of subjective interpretation of the available evidence. Determining which magnitude of change can be taken as clinically relevant is complex although crucial to define long-term strategies. Similarly, estimating not only the possible benefits but also the risks of treatments at the individual level is of major importance to guide choices. In the future biomarkers may be of help in that respect. They will hopefully emerge from progresses in systems biology and medicine. Before then, prescriptions should be restricted to the appropriate treatment indications, as established by high level studies and formalized by guidelines."
"Discerning false positives from true actives in high-throughput screening (HTS) output is fraught with difficulty as the reason of anomalous activity seen for compounds is often not clear-cut. In this study, we introduce a novel medium-throughput NMR assay for the identification of redox-cycling compounds (RCCs), which is based on detection of oxidation of a reducing agent. We compare its outcomes to those from horseradish peroxidase (HRP)/phenol red and resazurin (RZ)-based assays that are more commonly used for triaging HTS outputs. Data from NMR, RZ, and HRP redox assay are shown to correlate, with the NMR assay showing the greatest accuracy. In addition, historical data analysis was used to identify compounds frequently active in assays for redox-susceptible targets. We provide examples of compound classes found and conclude that the NMR redox assay offers a novel and reliable way of identifying RCCs at a medium throughput. The HRP and RZ assays are reasonable higher-throughput alternatives, with both showing similar sensitivity to redox-cycling and false-positive compounds. The RZ assay has a higher hit rate, reflecting its ability to pick up multiple modes of action."
"In this work, a new exploitation of the thermostable ?-glycosidase from Sulfolobus solfataricus expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to create functional foods for low lactose diets was evaluated. For this purpose, the lactose hydrolysis reaction using immobilized and soluble enzymes was investigated. Activity and stability at different conditions of pH and temperature were tested. The immobilization process had a big impact on the catalysis performance, leading to an enhancement of the enzymatic reaction rate on lactose, as demonstrated by the increasing of 2 and 2.5 folds of Kcatand Kcat/KM, respectively. Moreover, the maximal activity for the immobilized form was referred at pH 6.5 instead of 7.0, leading to an improvement of the catalytic performance at milk pHs. Although the soluble enzyme was already weakly inhibited by the reaction products, the immobilization further reduced the inhibitory action of glucose increasing the Kifrom 96.7 to 110.4 mM. Finally, the immobilized enzyme showed high hydrolysis rate in whole milk that yielded 99% of lactose breakdown in 10 and 30 min at 60 and 40°C, respectively. These results support the application of the immobilized ?-glycosidase for the development of new functional foods particularly suitable to the alleviation of lactose intolerance."
"We herein describe a case of pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) with rapidly progressing colon cancer. A 61-year-old man who had been receiving treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus for 3 years was hospitalized due to critical hypoxemia. Computed tomography, which had not shown any abnormalities 3 months previously, revealed a tumor in the ascending colon, multiple nodules in the liver, and the absence of any lung abnormalities. On day 3 of hospitalization, a sudden onset of severe dyspnea and tachycardia occurred, followed by death. Autopsy revealed microscopic metastatic tumor emboli in multiple pulmonary vessels with fibrin thrombus and intimal proliferation, which led to a diagnosis of PTTM."
"The dosage and frequency of lamotrigine administration for each patient must be prescribed carefully according to the disease, age, concomitant medications, and administration period. According to Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) reports, either the number of patients with adverse events caused by the inappropriate use of lamotrigine or the ratio of the patients who have benefited from the Relief System for Adverse Drug Reactions did not change even after the revision of the package insert in 2015. The procedure for auditing lamotrigine prescriptions was standardized to improve patient safety in our hospitals. The efficacy of standardization was evaluated by investigating the patients' records and prescriptions. A total of 77 patients treated with lamotrigine were examined to evaluate the appropriateness of the dosage and frequency of administration as well as the number of prescription enquiries made by pharmacists retrospectively. In addition, the presence of adverse events such as skin rash was examined using medical records. The number of inappropriate cases found and the prescription questions asked by pharmacists during the 24-month period before and after standardization were compared. The rate of inappropriate prescriptions after standardization was significantly lower than that before (12.1 vs. 29%; p<0.05). The rate of prescription questions raised after standardization was significantly higher than that before (37.0 vs. 1.7%; p<0.05). Moreover, there was no adverse event after standardization. Our standardization practice was effective to easily identify inappropriate prescriptions and provide physicians with the appropriate dosage or frequency of administration for the patients."
"The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze 6,613 diagnosed cancer cases in the Black Sea Turkish province of Giresun over a period of 12 years.Data of this retrospective crosssectional study was collected from 6,613 cancer patients at Prof. Dr. A. Ilhan Özdemir Education and Research Hospital between 2005- 2016. MINITAB 15 package software was used for statistical analysis. Chi-Square test and differences between two ratios significance test were used to calculate the relationship between two nominal (categorical) variables.Total 6,613 cancer patient's (3,759 men, 56.8% and 2,854 women, 43.2%) average age is 66.27±17.17. The most frequent types of cancer found among men included prostate (24.4%), bronchus-lung (12.5%) and colorectal (11.15%) cancer; whilst among for women it was breast (26%), thyroid (14.9%) and skin (10.6%) cancer, respectively. Kidney, bronchus-lung, skin, larynx, breast, bladder and thyroid cancer types were determined to be statistically significant according to gender (p<0.05).We reviewed the diagnosed cancer cases in Giresun province from 2005 to 2016. For men, the order of the most frequent cancer types mentioned is consistent with the statistics of both the European Union (EU) as well as the United States of America (USA); whereas for women it was consistent with Turkey's own national statistics. However, our findings state that thyroid cancer is the second most common cancer type among Turkish women, this is in contrast to most other parts of the world, the EU and USA."
"SummaryThis study aimed to understand how germ cell development occurs in females of Devario aequipinnatus, by morphologically describing oogenesis and the reproductive phases. Sexually mature females of D. aequipinnatus (n = 70) were obtained from commercial fisheries and delivered to the Laboratório de Ictiologia Neotropical, UNESP, Ilha Solteira, SP, Brazil. The ovaries were removed, fragmented and fixed following the usual techniques for light microscopy. The stages of ovarian development in D. aequipinnatus begin with the oogonia, which proliferate into new cells or differentiate into prophasic oocytes that, at the end of this process, form the ovarian follicle and end folliculogenesis. In the previtellogenic stage, the oocytes were characterized mainly by the gradual loss of basophilia and an increase in oocyte diameter. Vitellogenesis was marked mainly by the incorporation of yolk granules. Mature oocytes were defined by their migration from the nucleus to the micropyle. Postovulatory follicles and atresic oocytes were also observed. The reproductive phases were classified as: immature, early and final developing, spawning capable, regressing and regenerating. Therefore, the development of an understanding of cell modifications that occurs up to oogenesis is a basic step that is essential for the description of the reproductive biology of D. aequipinnatus, given the lack of information about the reproductive aspects of this species."
"Increased cardiovascular disease risk and prevalence associated with overweight and obesity is due, in part, to heightened inflammatory burden. The mechanisms underlying adiposity-related amplification of inflammation are not fully understood. Alterations in regulators of inflammatory processes such as microRNAs (miRs), however, is thought to play a pivotal role.The aim of this study was to determine the influence of overweight and obesity, independent of other cardiovascular risk factors, on circulating expression of miR-34a, miR-126, miR-146a, miR-150 and miR-181b.Forty-five sedentary, middle-aged (47-64 years) adults were studied: 15 normal weight (8M/7F; BMI: 23.3±0.3kg/m2); 15 overweight (8M/7F; 28.2±0.3 kg/m2); and 15 obese (7M/8F; 32.3±0.5 kg/m2). All subjects were non-smokers, normotensive and free of overt cardiometabolic disease. Circulating levels of the following inflammation-related miRs: miR-34a, miR-126, miR-146a, miR-150 and miR-181b were determined in plasma using standard RT-PCR techniques. miR expression was normalized to exogenous C. elegans miR-39 and reported as relative expression (AU).Circulating miR-34a was ~200% higher (P<0.05) in the obese compared with normal weight and overweight groups. Whereas, miR-126, miR-146a and miR-150 were significantly lower (~65%) in both the obese and overweight groups than the normal weight group. There were no significant group differences in circulating expression of miR-181b. miR-34a was positively related (r=0.40; P<0.05); whereas, miR-126 (r=-0.48), miR-146a (r=-0.32) and miR-150 (r=-0.36) levels were significantly inversely related to BMI.Overweight and obesity, independent of other cardiometabolic risk factors, negatively influences the circulating inflammation-related miRs. Dysregulation of circulating miRs may contribute mechanistically to the heightened inflammatory state associated with overweight and obesity."
"Study on bioactive molecules, capable of stabilizing G-Quadruplex structures is considered to be a potential strategy for anticancer drug development. Berberrubine (BER) and two of its analogs bearing alkyl phenyl and biphenyl substitutions at 13-position were studied for targeting human telomeric G-quadruplex DNA sequence. The structures of berberrubine and analogs were optimized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Time-dependent DFT (B3LYP) calculations were used to establish and understand the nature of the electronic transitions observed in UV-vis spectra of the alkaloid. The interaction of berberrubine and its analogs with human telomeric G-quadruplex DNA sequence 5'-(GGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG)-3' was investigated by biophysical techniques and molecular docking study. Both the analogs were found to exhibit higher binding affinity than natural precursor berberrrubine. 13-phenylpropyl analog (BER1) showed highest affinity [ (1.45 ± 0.03)× 105M-1] while the affinity of the 13-diphenyl analog (BER2) was lower at (1.03 ± 0.05) × 105M-1, and that of BER was (0.98 ± 0.03) × 105M-1. Comparative fluorescence quenching studies gave evidence for a stronger stacking interaction of the analog compared to berberrubine.The thiazole orange displacement assay has clearly established that the analogs were more effective in displacing the end stacked dye in comparison to berberrubine. Molecular docking study showed that each alkaloid ligand binds primarily at the G rich regions of hTelo G4 DNA which makes them G specific binder towards hTelo G4 DNA. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies of quadruplex- berberrubine analog interaction revealed an exothermic binding that was favoured by both enthalpy and entropy changes in BER in contrast to the analogs where the binding was majorly enthalpy dominated. A 1:1 binding stoichiometry was revealed in all the systems.This study establishes the potentiality of berberrubine analogs as a promising natural product based compounds as G-quadruplex specific ligands."
"The growing presence of research shared on social media, coupled with the increase in freely available research, invites us to ask whether scientific articles shared on platforms like Twitter diffuse beyond the academic community. We explore a new method for answering this question by identifying 11 articles from two open access biology journals that were shared on Twitter at least 50 times and by analyzing the follower network of users who tweeted each article. We find that diffusion patterns of scientific articles can take very different forms, even when the number of times they are tweeted is similar. Our small case study suggests that most articles are shared within single-connected communities with limited diffusion to the public. The proposed approach and indicators can serve those interested in the public understanding of science, science communication, or research evaluation to identify when research diffuses beyond insular communities."
"This study analyzed the associations between measured levels of aquaporin (AQP) mRNAs and clinical manifestations in patients with various types of otitis media (OM).AQP1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 mRNA levels were assayed by real-time PCR from 57 patients with chronic otitis media (COM), 24 patients with cholesteatomatous otitis media (choleOM), and 82 patients with otitis media with effusion (OME). The relationships of these mRNA levels with the presence of bacteria, the type of hearing loss, and clinical manifestations of OM types were evaluated.All eight AQP mRNAs were expressed in inflammatory tissue, chole matrix, and effusion fluid obtained from all 163 patients with OM. The levels in OME of AQP2, 4, 6, and 10 mRNA; and the levels in choleOM of AQP1, 3, 4, and 10 mRNA were elevated significantly compared to the corresponding levels in COM (p?<?.05). The expression level of AQP8 mRNA did not differ among OM types. Among samples positive for bacterial culture, AQP1 mRNA was significantly higher in OME than in COM and choleOM, AQP5 mRNA was significantly lower in OME than in COM and choleOM, and AQP10 mRNA was significantly higher in OME and choleOM than in COM (p?<?.05).The levels of expression of AQP mRNA are associated with the pathophysiology of OM."
"Humans are exposed to ionizing radiations in medical radiodiagnosis and radiotherapy that cause oxidative damages and degenerative diseases. Airplane pilots, and even more astronauts, are exposed to a variety of potentially harmful factors, including cosmic radiations. Among the phytochemicals, phenols are particularly efficient in countering the oxidative stress. In the present study, different extracts obtained from plant food, plant by-products and dietary supplements, have been compared for their antioxidant properties before and after irradiation of 140 cGy, a dose absorbed during a hypothetical stay of three years in the space. All the dry extracts, characterized in terms of vitamin C and phenolic content, remained chemically unaltered and maintained their antioxidant capability after irradiation. Our results suggest the potential use of these extracts as nutraceuticals to protect humans from oxidative damages, even when these extracts must be stored in an environment exposed to cosmic radiations as in a space station."
"Mitochondria, evolutionally acquired symbionts of eukaryotic cells, are essential cytoplasmic organelles. They are structurally dynamic organelles that continually go through fission and fusion processes in response to various stimuli. Tumor tissue is composed of not just cancer cells but also various cell types like fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem and immune cells. Mitochondrial dynamics of cancer cells has been shown to be significantly affected by features of tumor microenvironment such as hypoxia, inflammation and energy deprivation. The interactions of cancer cells with tumor microenvironment like hypoxia give rise to the inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity, causing chemoresistance. In this review, we will focus on the chemoresistance by tumoral heterogeneity in relation to mitochondrial dynamics of cancer cells. Recent findings in molecular mechanisms involved in the control of mitochondrial dynamics as well as the impact of mitochondrial dynamics on drug sensitivity in cancer are highlighted in the current review."
"Bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas are widespread in nature. In the last decades, members of this genus, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida, have acquired great interest because of their interactions with higher organisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the lung of cystic fibrosis patients, while P. putida is a soil bacterium able to establish a positive interaction with the plant rhizosphere. Members of Pseudomonas genus have a robust metabolism for amino acids and organic acids as well as aromatic compounds; however, these microbes metabolize a very limited number of sugars. Interestingly, they have three-pronged metabolic system to generate 6-phosphogluconate from glucose suggesting an adaptation to efficiently consume this sugar. This review focuses on the description of the regulatory network of glucose utilization in Pseudomonas, highlighting the differences between P. putida and P. aeruginosa. Most interestingly, It is highlighted a functional link between glucose assimilation and exotoxin A production in P. aeruginosa. The physiological relevance of this connection remains unclear, and it needs to be established whether a similar relationship is also found in other bacteria."
"The circadian clock is an important regulator of growth and development that has evolved to help organisms anticipate the predictably occurring events on the planet, such as light-dark transitions and adapt growth and development to these. This review looks back in history on how knowledge about the endogenous biological clock has been acquired over the centuries, with a focus on discoveries in plants. Key findings at the physiological, genetic, and molecular level are described and the role of the circadian clock in important molecular processes is reviewed. This article is protected by copyright.

"The MYO6 gene, if altered, can cause non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) either in autosomal dominant (AD) (DFNA22) or recessive form. This study identified MYO6 variants in the cohort of Korean AD NSHL families and investigated the audiological phenotypes of DFNA22 to suggest clinical guides for the counseling of DFNA22.Retrospective cohort study was performed on 81 AD NSHL families in two hospitals. Among them, five families (SH21, SB60, SB247, SB290, and SB305) segregating with MYO6 variant were genetically and clinically assessed.We identified two novel missense variants of MYO6: p.G223R (SB290) and p.T158R (SB305). A known heterozygous truncation variant, p.R205X, reported in our previous study (SH21, SB60), was identified (SB247). The overall frequency of DFNA22 among such cases was 6.2 %. Specifically, we found p.R205X from three of five DFNA22 families (60%). Five DFNA22 families demonstrated extremely diverse audiogram configurations and onset age with even intrafamilial variations, while the severity of hearing loss mostly ranged within moderate.We report a recurring predominant allele and two new missense variants of MYO6, highlighting the significant contribution of MYO6 to AD NSHL in the Korean population. Extremely diverse audiological configurations of DFNA22 suggests that MYO6 should be considered in future genetic studies of patients with AD NSHL. Gradual progression with a good speech audiometry score could provide physicians with clinical insight to advise patients to use hearing aids or consider middle ear implants, while in the case of certain exceptional circumstances, provide patients with the option to consider CI."
"Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) contains a cell subpopulation referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are responsible for tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The CSC markers have been used to isolate these cells and as biomarkers to predict overall survival.The CSC markers CD44, NANOG, OCT4, and BMI1 were investigated using reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinicopathological parameters.The CD44 overexpression was associated with disease-related death (P = 0.02) and worst prognosis. NANOG was upregulated in nontumoral margins and associated with T1/T2 classification, lymph node metastasis, and worst prognosis. OCT4 was associated with lymph node metastasis and worst overall survival. BMI1 and CD44v3 were overexpressed in tongue SCC. Coexpression of CD44++/NANOG++was associated with worst overall survival when compared with patients with CD44-/+/NANOG-/+.The CSC markers might play an important role not only in CSC trait acquisition but also in tongue SCC development and progression."
"Twin-Twin Transfusion syndrome is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Potential treatments require robust evaluation. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcome reporting across observational studies and randomised controlled trials assessing treatments for twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE and Medline were searched from inception to August 2016. Observational studies and randomised controlled trials reporting outcomes following a treatment for TTTS in monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies and monochorionic-triamniotic or dichorionic-triamniotic triplet pregnancies were included. We systematically extracted and categorised outcome reporting.Six randomised trials and 94 observational studies, reporting data from 20,071 maternal participants and 3,199 children, were included. Six different treatments were evaluated. Included studies reported sixty-two different outcomes, including 10 fetal, 28 neonatal, 6 early childhood and 18 maternal outcomes. The outcomes were inconsistently reported across trials. For example, when considering offspring mortality, 31 studies (31%) reported live birth, 31 studies (31%) reported intrauterine death, 49 studies (49%) reported neonatal mortality, and 17 studies (17%) reported perinatal mortality. Four studies (4%) reported respiratory distress syndrome. Only 19 (19%) of studies were designed for long-term follow-up and 11 of these studies (11%) reported cerebral palsy.Most studies evaluating treatments for TTTS, have often neglected to report clinically important outcomes, especially neonatal morbidity outcomes. Most studies are not designed for long-term follow-up. The development of a core outcome set could help standardised outcome collection and reporting in Twin-Twin Transfusion syndrome studies."
"Quite exactly 60 years ago, an article in Nature presented the first low-resolution model of a globular protein derived by direct structure determination. The work was part of an ongoing effort by John Kendrew and his colleagues at the Medical Research Council Unit for Molecular Biology in Cambridge (UK) that two years later led to the publication of the first atomic structure of the same protein, myoglobin.1,2In 1962, John Kendrew together with Max Perutz, working in the same laboratory, received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for their studies of the structures of globular proteins. This essay retraces the work that led to this extraordinary achievement. It centers on the contribution of John Kendrew although, as is well known, every result in science relies on the work of many people that contribute to it in myriads of ways. It reconstructs how Kendrew took up the challenge of protein X-ray crystallography, a field then still in its infancy. It recounts how Kendrew settled on sperm whale myoglobin as the best source for growing crystals, his early use of electronic computers and other resources he marshalled to achieve the atomic resolution of the protein structure. It discusses the role of models in achieving the result and their reception. The essay ends with a short outlook of Kendrew's career after his work on myoglobin and his other contributions to the establishment of the new science of molecular biology.

"Centrin is a member of the EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins, a highly conserved eukaryotic protein that binds to Ca2+. Its self-assembly plays a causative role in the fiber contraction that is associated with the cell division cycle and ciliogenesis. In this study, the crystal structure of N-terminal domain of Ciliate Euplotes octocarinatus centrin (N-EoCen) was determined by using the selenomethionine single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. The protein molecules formed homotrimers. Every protomer had two putative Ca2+ion-binding sites I and II, protomer A and C bound one Ca2+ion, while protomer B bound two Ca2+ions. A novel binding site III was observed and the Ca2+ion was located at the center of the homotrimer. Several hydrogen bonds, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the protomers contributed to the formation of the oligomer. Structural studies provided insight into the foundation for centrin aggregation and the roles of calcium ions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
"Although accumulating evidence demonstrates the crosstalk between melatonin and auxin as derivatives of tryptophan, the underlying signaling events remain unclear. In this study, we found that melatonin and auxin mediated the transcriptional levels of zinc finger of Arabidopsis thaliana (ZAT6) in a mutually antagonistic manner. ZAT6 negatively modulated the endogenous auxin level, and ZAT6 knockdown plants were less sensitive to melatonin-regulated auxin biosynthesis, indicating its involvement in melatonin-mediated auxin accumulation. Additionally, the identification of INDETERMINATE DOMAIN15 (IDD15) and INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID 17 (IAA17) in Arabidopsis that interacted with ZAT6 in vivo provided new insight of ZAT6-mediated auxin signaling. Further investigation showed that ZAT6 repressed the transcription activation of IDD15 on the YUC2 promoter, while ZAT6 inhibited the interaction of TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1) and IAA17 through competitively binding to IAA17. Thus, both auxin synthesis and the auxin response were negatively modulated by ZAT6. Taken together, ZAT6 is involved in melatonin-mediated auxin signaling through forming an interacting complex of auxin signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. This article is protected by copyright.

"Prostaglandin (PG) D2is the ligand for the G-protein coupled receptors DP1 (D-type prostanoid receptor 1) and DP2 (also known as chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule, expressed on Th2 cells; CRTH2). Both, DP1 and DP2 are expressed on the cellular surface of eosinophils; although it has become quite clear that PGD2induces eosinophil migration mainly via DP2 receptors, the role of DP1 in eosinophil responses has remained elusive. In this study, we addressed how DP1 receptor signaling complements the pro-inflammatory effects of DP2. We found that PGD2prolongs the survival of eosinophils via a DP1 receptor-mediated mechanism that inhibits the onset of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade. The DP1 agonist BW245c prevented the activation of effector caspases in eosinophils and protected mitochondrial membranes from depolarization which-as a consequence-sustained viability of eosinophils. DP1 activation in eosinophils enhanced the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-XL, but also induced pro-inflammatory genes, such as VLA-4 and CCR3. In HEK293 cells that overexpress recombinant DP1 and/or DP2 receptors, activation of DP1, but not DP2, delayed cell death and stimulated proliferation, along with induction of serum response element (SRE), a regulator of anti-apoptotic, early-response genes. We conclude that DP1 receptors promote the survival via SRE induction and induction of pro-inflammatory genes. Therefore, targeting DP1 receptors, along with DP2, may contribute to anti-inflammatory therapy in eosinophilic diseases."
"The nitrogen (N) fertilizer play an important role in tea plantation management, with significant impacts on the photosynthetic capacity, productivity and nutrition status of tea plants. The present study aimed to establish a method for the discrimination of N fertilizer levels using hyperspectral imaging technique.Spectral data were extracted from the region of interest (ROI), followed by the first derivative (D1) to reduce background noise. Five optimal wavelengths were selected by principal component analysis (PCA). Texture features were extracted from the images at optimal wavelengths by gray-level gradient co-occurrence matrix (GLGCM). Support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) were used to build classification models based on spectral data, optimal wavelengths, texture features, and data fusion, respectively. SVM model using fused data gave the best performance with highest correct classification rate (CCR) of 100% for prediction set.The overall results indicated that visible and near infrared hyperspectral imaging combined with SVM were effective in discriminating N fertilizer levels of tea plants."
"Ecological niche modeling (ENM) has been used to assess how abiotic variables influence species distributions and diversity. Baboons are broadly distributed throughout Africa, yet the degree of climatic specialization is largely unexplored for individual taxa. Also, the influence of climate on baboon phylogenetic divergence is unknown. In this study, we constructed ENMs to investigate how niches vary across Papio species to understand how climatic variables have influenced their biogeography and mode of speciation.We used Maxent to generate ENMs by collating locality data for six Papio species and climate information from WorldClim. In addition, we examined the degree of niche overlap among all possible pairs of taxa, which can provide insight into patterns of species diversity. Lastly, we conducted a Mantel test to assess the relationship between niche overlap and estimated time since divergence.Our models performed moderately to extremely well, with a mean area under the curve value of 0.868. The species with the best models include P. papio and P. kindae, whereas P. hamadryas had the poorest models. We found that most species pairs exhibited significantly different niches. Lastly, we found no significant correlation between niche overlap and divergence times.Niche models had good predictive power, which indicates Papio species distributions are correlated with climatic variables to varying degrees. Significantly little niche overlap and incomplete geographic boundaries suggests these models generally support a parapatric speciation scenario for the genus Papio."
"Acetic acid tolerance and xylose consumption are desirable traits for yeast strains used in industrial biotechnological processes. In this work, overexpression of a weak acid stress transcriptional activator encoded by the gene HAA1 and a phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase encoded by PRS3 in a recombinant industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain containing a xylose metabolic pathway was evaluated in the presence of acetic acid in xylose- or glucose-containing media. HAA1 or PRS3 overexpression resulted in superior yeast growth and higher sugar consumption capacities in the presence of 4 g/L acetic acid, and a positive synergistic effect resulted from the simultaneous overexpression of both genes. Overexpressing these genes also improved yeast adaptation to a non-detoxified hardwood hydrolysate with a high acetic acid content. Furthermore, the overexpression of HAA1 and/or PRS3 was found to increase the robustness of yeast cell wall when challenged with acetic acid stress, suggesting the involvement of the modulation of the cell wall integrity pathway. This study clearly shows HAA1 and/or, for the first time, PRS3 overexpression to play an important role in the improvement of industrial yeast tolerance towards acetic acid. The results expand the molecular toolbox and add to the current understanding of the mechanisms involved in higher acetic acid tolerance, paving the way for the further development of more efficient industrial processes."
"Viruses related to the herpes simplex viruses of humans are present in all nonhuman primate (NHP) species tested and cross species transmission has been documented. The herpesvirus present in macaques, Herpes B virus (BV) rarely causes disease in its natural macaque host. However, when transmitted to a nonnative host, BV has occasionally caused severe and even fatal disease if not treated immediately. Here we present a comprehensive review of the taxonomy, molecular biology, physiology, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of BV. We also summarizes what is known about related herpesviruses of other NHP species and the zoonotic potential of these viruses."
"Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate the vast majority of fast synaptic transmission in the nervous system. When the iGluR ion channel is in the open or conducting conformation, it is non-selective for monovalent cations, driving membrane excitation. Often the channel is also permeable to Ca2+. This process of Ca2+permeation and its physiological and pathological consequences depend strongly on the specific iGluR subtype as well as the specific subunits in the oligomeric complex. Recent evidence has highlighted additional levels of diversity to this process including a dependence on specific auxiliary subunits in non-NMDARs and post-translational modifications in NMDARs. Variousde novomissense mutations associated with neurological disease in NMDAR subunits have been identified in regions critical to Ca2+influx. These features highlight the dynamics of Ca2+influx mediated by iGluRs and its critical role in synaptic physiology and pathology."
"Organoids, organ-mimicking multicellular structures derived from pluripotent stem cells or organ progenitors, have recently emerged as an important system for both studies of stem cell biology and development of potential therapeutics; however, a large-scale culture of organoids and cryopreservation for whole organoids, a prerequisite for their industrial and clinical applications, has remained a challenge. Current organoid culture systems relying on embedding the stem or progenitor cells in bulk extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels (e.g., Matrigel™) have limited surface area for mass transfer and are not suitable for large-scale productions. Here, we demonstrate a capsule-based, scalable organoid production and cryopreservation platform. The capsules have a core-shell structure where the core consists of Matrigel™ that supports the growth of organoids, and the alginate shell form robust spherical capsules, enabling suspension culture in stirred bioreactors. Compared with conventional, bulk ECM hydrogels, the capsules, which could be produced continuously by a two-fluidic electrostatic co-spraying method, provided better mass transfer through both diffusion and convection. The core-shell structure of the capsules also leads to better cell recovery after cryopreservation of organoids probably through prevention of intracellular ice formation."
"Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) has been reported worldwide as the main agent related to acute hemorrhagic enteritis of high morbidity and variable mortality in puppies. The detection and characterization of this virus is essential to understand the etiology of the disease and to develop control measures. To characterize the virus circulating in Peruvian dogs and to provide new insights into the local diversity of CPV-2, rectal swabs from 39 puppies with clinical symptoms and with no history of previous vaccinations were analyzed. Total DNA was extracted by fast boiling method, and PCR and sequencing were performed using specific primers that amplify a 1316 bp fragment corresponding to the VP2 gene of CPV-2. CPV-2 was detected in 62% of the analyzed samples. The sequencing of PCR product was possible in 9 samples, which were identified as type 2a (4 samples) and type 2c (5 samples). A phylogenetic analysis of both variants circulating in Peruvian dogs showed similarities to Equatorian and Uruguayan strains. This work constitutes the first report about genetic characterization of CPV-2 in Peru."
"Rotavirus (RV), is an etiological agent of acute infantile diarrhea in both humans and animals including poultry. Among the eight accepted species/types of RVs, RV-A is genetically and antigenically the most diverse. RV-A associated enteritis is a major problem in the weaning and post-weaning piglets. Due to high genetic variability in the antigenic regions, RV-A is thought to have high interspecies jumping probability. In this study, comparatively a large sized sample (n = 757) was screened, where the samples were collected from diarrheic porcine population of north (Uttar Pradesh), North eastern (Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, Manipur, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh) and Southern states of India (Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu). The VP6 gene based reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR based screening of the samples for RV-A identified 42.4% (321/757) positivity, where highest identification was from Uttar Pradesh 119 (37.07%), followed by 74 (23.05%), 34 (10.6%), 31 (9.65%), 21 (6.54%), 15 (4.67%), 11 (3.43%), 8 (2.49%), 3 (0.93%), 3 (0.93%) and 2 (0.62%) from Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, Kerala, Manipur, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, respectively. Percentage identity calculation of the VP6 gene sequences from different porcine RV-A revealed 77.1-97.3% identity within the Indian porcine RV-A strains of the current study. Phylodendrogram and percent identity based analysis of the amplified and sequenced full length VP6 gene confirmed the presence of new VP6 genotypes (I1 and I5). Although, there are reports of detection of porcine RV-A based on VP6 gene from India, no lineage/genotype based characterization is available for the target gene. Till date, only a single VP6 type (I2) has been confirmed from pig population of India. Here, the findings confirm the circulation of diverse RV-A strains in porcine population in India."
"Cassava mosaic disease is a widespread disease of cassava in south Asia and the African continent. In India, CMD is known to be caused by two single-stranded DNA viruses (geminiviruses), Indian cassava mosaic virus (ICMV) and Sri Lankan cassava mosdaic virus (SLCMV). Previously, the diversity of ICMV and SLCMV in India has been studied using PCR, a sequence-dependent method. To have a more in-depth study of the variability of the above viruses and to detect any novel geminiviruses associated with CMD, sequence-independent amplification using rolling circle amplification (RCA)-based methods were used. CMD affected cassava plants were sampled across eighty locations in nine districts of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Twelve complete sequence of coat protein genes of the resident geminiviruses, comprising 256 amino acid residues were generated from the above samples, which indicated changes at only six positions. RCA followed by RFLP of the 80 samples indicated that most samples (47) contained only SLCMV, followed by 8, which were infected jointly with ICMV and SLCMV. In 11 samples, the pattern did not match the expected patterns from either of the two viruses and hence, were variants. Sequence analysis of an average of 700 nucleotides from 31 RCA-generated fragments of the variants indicated identities of 97-99% with the sequence of a previously reported infectious clone of SLCMV. The evidence suggests low levels of genetic variability in the begomoviruses infecting cassava, mainly in the form of scattered single nucleotide changes."
"Ever since their discovery just about 56 years ago in the cultivated mushroomAgaricus bisporus, many more viruses infecting fungi have been identified in a wide range of fungal taxa. With mostly being asymptomatic, especially the ones that are detrimental to their phytopathogenic hosts are intensively studied due to their considerable importance in developing novel plant protection measures. Contrary to the rapid accumulation of notable data on viruses of plant pathogenic microfungi, much less information have hitherto been obtained in regards to the viruses whose hosts are macrofungi. According to the current literature, only more than 80 distinct viruses bearing either linear dsRNA or linear positive sense ssRNA genome and infecting a total number of 34 macrofungal species represented with fourAscomycotaand 30Basidiomycotahave been identified so far. Among these 34 macrofungal species, 14 are cultivated edible and wild edible mushroom species. According to the 10th ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) Report, macrofungal viruses with linear dsRNA genome are classified into five families (Partitiviridae,Totiviridae,Chrysoviridae,EndornaviridaeandHypoviridae) and macrofungal viruses with linear positive sense ssRNA genome are classified into seven families (Betaflexiviridae,Gammaflexiviridae,Barnaviridae,Narnaviridae,Virgaviridae,BenyviridaeandTymoviridae). In this review, following a brief overview of some general characteristics of fungal viruses, an up to date knowledge on viruses infecting macrofungal hosts were presented by summarizing the previous, recent and prospective studies of the field."
"Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NH) is a common finding in newborn babies in Indonesia. Common and rare variants ofUGT1A1have been known to contribute to NH etiology. This study aims to identifyUGT1A1genetic variation and haplotype associated with NH in Indonesian population. DNA was isolated from 116 cases and 115 controls and a targeted-deep sequencing approach was performed on the promoter, UTRs, and exonic regions ofUGT1A1. Determining association of common variants and haplotype analysis were performed using PLINK and Haploview. Ten and 4 rare variants were identified in cases and controls, respectively. TheUGT1A1rare variants frequency in cases (5.17%) was higher than that in controls (1.7%). Four of those rare variants in cases (p.Ala61Thr, p.His300Arg, p.Lys407Asn, and p.Tyr514Asn) and three in controls (p.Tyr79X, p.Ala346Val, and p.Thr412Ser) are novel variants. The frequencies of p.Gly71Arg, p.Pro229Gln, and TA7common variants were not significantly different between cases and controls. A haplotype, consisting of 3 major alleles of 3' UTRs common variants (rs8330C>G, rs10929303C>T, and rs1042640C>G), was associated with NH incidence (p= 0.025) in this population. Using targeted-deep sequencing and haplotype analysis, we identified novelUGT1A1rare variants and disease-associated haplotype in NH in Indonesian population."
"The aim of the study was to determine the most commonly diagnosed neoplasms in the MRI scanned patient population and indicate correlations based on the descriptive variables.The SPSS software was used to determine the incidence of neoplasms within the specific diagnoses based on the descriptive variables of the studied population. Over a five year period, 791 patients and 839 MRI scans were identified in neoplasm category (C00-D48 according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10).More women (56%) than men (44%) represented C00-D48. Three categories of neoplasms were recorded. Furthermore, benign neoplasms were the most numerous, diagnosed mainly in patients in the fifth decade of life, and included benign neoplasms of the brain and other parts of the central nervous system.Males ? 30 years of age with neoplasms had three times higher MRI scans rate than females of the same age group; even though females had much higher scans rate in every other category. The young males are more often selected for these scans if a neoplasm is suspected. Finally, the number of MRI-diagnosed neoplasms showed a linear annual increase."
"The urinary metabolomic study based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) had been developed to investigate the possible antidepressant mechanism of chlorogenic acid (CGA) in a rat model of sleep deprivation (SD). According to pattern recognition analysis, there was a clear separation among big platform group (BP), sleep deprivation group (SD), and the CGA (model?+?CGA), and CGA group was much closer to the BP group by showing a tendency of recovering towards BP group. Thirty-six significantly changed metabolites related to antidepressant by CGA were identified and used to explore the potential mechanism. Combined with the result of the classic behavioral tests and biochemical indices, CGA has significant antidepressant effects in a rat model of SD, suggesting that the mechanism of action of CGA might be involved in regulating the abnormal pathway of nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism; glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; and arginine and proline metabolism. Our results also show that metabolomics analysis based on GC-MS is a useful tool for exploring biomarkers involved in depression and elucidating the potential therapeutic mechanisms of Chinese medicine."
"The recent advances in photocatalysis have opened a variety of new possibilities for energy and biomedical applications. In particular, plasmonic photocatalysis using hybridization of semiconductor materials and metal nanoparticles has recently facilitated the rapid progress in enhancing photocatalytic efficiency under visible or solar light. One critical underlying aspect of photocatalysis is that it generates and releases reactive oxygen species (ROS) as intermediate or final products upon light excitation or activation. Although plasmonic photocatalysis overcomes the limitation of UV irradiation, synthesized metal/semiconductor nanomaterial photocatalysts often bring up biohazardous and environmental issues. In this respect, this review article is centered in identifying natural photosensitizing organic materials that can generate similar types of ROS as those of plasmonic photocatalysis. In particular, we propose the idea of plasmonic photocatalyst-like fluorescent proteins for ROS generation under visible light irradiation. We recapitulate fluorescent proteins that have Type I and Type II photosensitization properties in a comparable manner to plasmonic photocatalysis. Plasmonic photocatalysis and protein photosensitization have not yet been compared systemically in terms of ROS photogeneration under visible light, although the phototoxicity and cytotoxicity of some fluorescent proteins are well recognized. A comprehensive understanding of plasmonic photocatalyst-like fluorescent proteins and their potential advantages will lead us to explore new environmental, biomedical, and defense applications."
"In this study, an alpha-amylase enzyme from a locally isolatedAspergillus flavusNSH9 was purified and characterized. The extracellular ?-amylase was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion-exchange chromatography at a final yield of 2.55-fold and recovery of 11.73%. The molecular mass of the purified ?-amylase was estimated to be 54 kDa using SDS-PAGE and the enzyme exhibited optimal catalytic activity at pH 5.0 and temperature of 50 °C. The enzyme was also thermally stable at 50 °C, with 87% residual activity after 60 min. As a metalloenzymes containing calcium, the purified ?-amylase showed significantly increased enzyme activity in the presence of Ca2+ions. Further gene isolation and characterization shows that the ?-amylase gene ofA. flavusNSH9 contained eight introns and an open reading frame that encodes for 499 amino acids with the first 21 amino acids presumed to be a signal peptide. Analysis of the deduced peptide sequence showed the presence of three conserved catalytic residues of ?-amylase, two Ca2+-binding sites, seven conserved peptide sequences, and several other properties that indicates the protein belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 13 capable of acting on ?-1,4-bonds only. Based on sequence similarity, the deduced peptide sequence ofA. flavusNSH9 ?-amylase was also found to carry two potential surface/secondary-binding site (SBS) residues (Trp 237 and Tyr 409) that might be playing crucial roles in both the enzyme activity and also the binding of starch granules."
"The bacterial flagellar hook is a short, highly curved tubular structure connecting the basal body as a rotary motor and the filament as a helical propeller to function as a universal joint to transmit motor torque to the filament regardless of its orientation. This highly curved form is known to be part of a supercoil as observed in the polyhook structure. The subunit packing interactions in theSalmonellahook structure solved in the straight form gave clear insights into the mechanisms of its bending flexibility and twisting rigidity.SalmonellaFlgE consists of four domains, D0, Dc, D1 and D2, arranged from inside to outside of the tube, and an atomic model of the supercoiled hook built to simulate the hook shape observed in the native flagellum suggested that the supercoiled form is stabilized by near-axial interactions of the D2 domains on the inner surface of the supercoil. Here we show that the deletion of domain D2 from FlgE makes the hook straight, providing evidence to support the proposed hook supercoiling mechanism that it is the near-axial interactions between the D2 domains that stabilize the highly curved hook structure."
"During the breeding season, male harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) make underwater acoustic displays using vocalizations known as roars. These roars have been shown to function in territory establishment in some breeding areas and have been hypothesized to be important for female choice, but the function of these sounds remains unresolved. This study consisted of a series of playback experiments in which captive female harbor seals were exposed to recordings of male roars to determine if females respond to recordings of male vocalizations and whether or not they respond differently to roars from categories with different acoustic characteristics. The categories included roars with characteristics of dominant males (longest duration, lowest frequency), subordinate males (shortest duration, highest frequency), combinations of call parameters from dominant and subordinate males (long duration, high frequency and short duration, low frequency), and control playbacks of water noise and water noise with tonal signals in the same frequency range as male signals. Results indicate that overall females have a significantly higher level of response to playbacks that imitate male vocalizations when compared to control playbacks of water noise. Specifically, there was a higher level of response to playbacks representing dominant male vocalization when compared to the control playbacks. For most individuals, there was a greater response to playbacks representing dominant male vocalizations compared to playbacks representing subordinate male vocalizations; however, there was no statistical difference between those two playback types. Additionally, there was no difference between the playbacks of call parameter combinations and the controls. Investigating female preference for male harbor seal vocalizations is a critical step in understanding the harbor seal mating system and further studies expanding on this captive study will help shed light on this important issue."
"Phenotypic variation along environmental gradients can provide evidence suggesting local adaptation has shaped observed morphological disparities. These differences, in traits such as body and extremity size, as well as skin and coat pigmentation, may affect the overall fitness of individuals in their environments. The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is a marsupial that shows phenotypic variation across its range, one that has recently expanded into temperate environments. It is unknown, however, whether the variation observed in the species fits adaptive ecogeographic patterns, or if phenotypic change is associated with any environmental factors. Using phenotypic measurements of over 300 museum specimens of Virginia opossum, collected throughout its distribution range, we applied regression analysis to determine if phenotypes change along a latitudinal gradient. Then, using predictors from remote-sensing databases and a random forest algorithm, we tested environmental models to find the most important variables driving the phenotypic variation. We found that despite the recent expansion into temperate environments, the phenotypic variation in the Virginia opossum follows a latitudinal gradient fitting three adaptive ecogeographic patterns codified under Bergmann's, Allen's and Gloger's rules. Temperature seasonality was an important predictor of body size variation, with larger opossums occurring at high latitudes with more seasonal environments. Annual mean temperature predicted important variation in extremity size, with smaller extremities found in northern populations. Finally, we found that precipitation and temperature seasonality as well as low temperatures were strong environmental predictors of skin and coat pigmentation variation; darker opossums are distributed at low latitudes in warmer environments with higher precipitation seasonality. These results indicate that the adaptive mechanisms underlying the variation in body size, extremity size and pigmentation are related to the resource seasonality, heat conservation, and pathogen-resistance hypotheses, respectively. Our findings suggest that marsupials may be highly susceptible to environmental changes, and in the case of the Virginia opossum, the drastic phenotypic evolution in northern populations may have arisen rapidly, facilitating the colonization of seasonal and colder habitats of temperate North America."
"The search for essential tremor (ET) genes is active, and it is only a matter of time before genetic tests become available. Genetic testing preferences in families have been studied in numerous other neurological disorders but there are no published data about ET.We surveyed 34 ET probands and their relatives (43 affected, 28 unaffected) enrolled in our Family Study of Essential Tremor to assess their interest in genetic testing. We examined whether clinical factors influenced their interest in testing. Clinical utility (""Your physician will be able to use the information obtained to improve your care"") and penetrance (""How likely an individual who carries an ET gene is to develop ET"") were defined for participants.Interest in genetic testing was high in ET families (90/105 [85.7%]). There was a significant difference between affected (including probands and affected relatives) and unaffected relatives in terms of their interest in genetic testing, with the former being more interested (70/77 [90.9%] vs. 20/28 [71.4%] p = 0.04). Participants were more likely to want testing in the scenarios with high clinical utility; disease penetrance was not a determining factor (all p < 0.05). Sixteen hypothetical factors were identified that might influence a participant's decision to undergo genetic testing for ET.Interest in genetic testing was high in ET families. While genetic testing is not currently available for ET, the hunt for ET genes is ongoing, and this is a highly familial disorder. Understanding genetic testing preferences will greatly aid clinicians once a genetic test becomes available."
"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of heat-killedLactobacillus paracaseiNFRI 7415 on kidney and bone in mice fed an ethanol-containing diet with stress. Eight-week-old Cril??:??CD1 mice were fed a control diet (CD), an alcohol diet (AD) (35.8% of total energy from ethanol), or an alcohol diet containing 20% heat-killedLb. paracaseiNFRI 7415 (107?CFU/g) (LD) for 4 weeks. Mice in the AD and LD groups also underwent restraint stress for two weeks from 13 days. The mice were placed in a 50?mL plastic tube, which had a small hole drilled around its base to allow ventilation, and restrained for 1?h every day. High final body weight was in the following order: CD, LD, and AD (p< 0.05). The heat-killedLb. paracaseiNFRI 7415 lowered liver total cholesterol concentration and plasma glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) level. In addition, fecal bile acids of the LD group were higher than in the AD group (p< 0.05). The glomerulus of the kidney in the AD group was observed to be more fibrotic than in the CD and LD groups with azan stain. Immunostaining confirmed that brown areas indicating the existence of mesangial cells were increased in the AD group, but not in the CD and LD groups. These results indicated that the heat-killedLb. paracaseiNFRI 7415 inhibited mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis by alcohol intake with stress."
"We evaluated the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes with chronic liver disease.Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels ?7.0%) and chronic liver disease were included in this study. Sixteen patients (HbA1c level, 7.2%±0.6%(55.2 mmol/mol)) were randomized to receive 900?mg UDCA for 12 weeks followed by 50?mg sitagliptin add-on therapy for 12 weeks (UDCA-first group; n=8) or 50?mg sitagliptin for 12 weeks followed by 900?mg UDCA add-on therapy for 12 weeks (sitagliptin-first group; n=8). All patients underwent a liquid high-fat meal test before and after 12 or 24 weeks of treatment.The baseline characteristics were similar between the UDCA-first and sitagliptin-first groups. There was a decrease in body weight (72.5±8.4?to 70.6±8.6?kg; P=0.04) and the HbA1c level (7.0%±0.3%?to 6.4%±0.5%(53.0 to 46.4?mmol/mol); P=0.01) in the UDCA-first group. The HbA1c level decreased further after sitagliptin administration (6.4%±0.5%?to 6.0%±0.4%(46.4 to 42.1?mmol/mol); P<0.01). Although there were no initial changes in the weight and HbA1c level in the sitagliptin-first group, the HbA1c level decreased after UDCA addition (7.1%±1.1%?to 6.6%±0.9%(54.1 to 48.6?mmol/mol); P=0.04). UDCA alone increased the area under the curve0-30for GLP-1 response (115.4±47.2?to 221.9±48.9?pmol·min/L; P<0.01), but not the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide response, in the UDCA-first group.UDCA treatment resulted in a greater reduction in HbA1c levels, and an increased early phase GLP-1 secretion.NCT01337440."
"Various hypotheses have been proposed for why the traits distinguishing humans from other primates originally evolved, and any given trait may have been explained both as an adaptation to different environments and as a result of demands from social organization or sexual selection. To find out how popular the different explanations are among scientists, we carried out an online survey among authors of recent scientific papers in journals covering relevant fields of science (paleoanthropology, paleontology, ecology, evolution, human biology). Some of the hypotheses were clearly more popular among the 1,266 respondents than others, but none was universally accepted or rejected. Even the most popular of the hypotheses were assessed ""very likely"" by <50% of the respondents, but many traits had 1-3 hypotheses that were found at least moderately likely by >70% of the respondents. An ordination of the hypotheses identified two strong gradients. Along one gradient, the hypotheses were sorted by their popularity, measured by the average credibility score given by the respondents. The second gradient separated all hypotheses postulating adaptation to swimming or diving into their own group. The average credibility scores given for different subgroups of the hypotheses were not related to respondent's age or number of publications authored. However, (paleo)anthropologists were more critical of all hypotheses, and much more critical of the water-related ones, than were respondents representing other fields of expertise. Although most respondents did not find the water-related hypotheses likely, only a small minority found them unscientific. The most popular hypotheses were based on inherent drivers; that is, they assumed the evolution of a trait to have been triggered by the prior emergence of another human-specific behavioral or morphological trait, but opinions differed as to which of the traits came first."
"Mangrove plants comprise plants with similar ecological features that have enabled them to adapt to life between the sea and the land. Within a geographic region, different mangrove species share not only similar adaptations but also similar genetic structure patterns. Along the eastern coast of South America, there is a subdivision between the populations north and south of the continent's northeastern extremity. Here, we aimed to test for this north-south genetic structure inRhizophora mangle,a dominant mangrove plant in the Western Hemisphere. Additionally, we aimed to study the relationships betweenR. mangle, R. racemosa,andR. × harrisoniiand to test for evidence of hybridization and introgression. Our results confirmed the north-south genetic structure pattern inR. mangleand revealed a less abrupt genetic break in the northern population than those observed inAvicenniaspecies, another dominant and widespread mangrove genus in the Western Hemisphere. These results are consistent with the role of oceanic currents influencing sea-dispersed plants and differences betweenAvicenniaandRhizophorapropagules in longevity and establishment time. We also observed that introgression and hybridization are relevant biological processes in the northeastern coast of South America and that they are likely asymmetric towardR. mangle,suggesting that adaptation might be a process maintaining this hybrid zone."
"Climate change alters the abiotic constraints faced by plants, including increasing temperature and water stress. These changes may affect flower development and production of flower rewards, thus altering plant-pollinator interactions. Here, we investigated the consequences of increased temperature and water stress on plant growth, floral biology, flower-reward production, and insect visitation of a widespread bee-visited species,Borago officinalis. Plants were grown for 5 weeks under three temperature regimes (21, 24, and 27°C) and two watering regimes (well-watered and water-stressed). Plant growth was more affected by temperature rise than water stress, and the reproductive growth was affected by both stresses. Vegetative traits were stimulated at 24°C, but impaired at 27°C. Flower development was mainly affected by water stress, which decreased flower number (15 ± 2 flowers/plant in well-watered plants vs. 8 ± 1 flowers/plant under water stress). Flowers had a reduced corolla surface under temperature rise and water stress (3.8 ± 0.5 cm2in well-watered plants at 21°C vs. 2.2 ± 0.1 cm2in water-stressed plants at 27°C). Both constraints reduced flower-reward production. Nectar sugar content decreased from 3.9 ± 0.3 mg/flower in the well-watered plants at 21°C to 1.3 ± 0.4 mg/flower in the water-stressed plants at 27°C. Total pollen quantity was not affected, but pollen viability decreased from 79 ± 4% in the well-watered plants at 21°C to 25 ± 9% in the water-stressed plants at 27°C. Flowers in the well-watered plants at 21°C received at least twice as many bumblebee visits compared with the other treatments. In conclusion, floral modifications induced by abiotic stresses related to climate change affect insect behavior and alter plant-pollinator interactions."
"Global change has the potential to affect river flow conditions which are fundamental determinants of physical habitats. Predictions of the effects of flow alterations on aquatic biota have mostly been assessed based on species ecological traits (e.g., current preferences), which are difficult to link to quantitative discharge data. Alternatively, we used empirically derived predictive relationships for species' response to flow to assess the effect of flow alterations due to climate change in two contrasting central European river catchments. Predictive relationships were set up for 294 individual species based on (1) abundance data from 223 sampling sites in the Kinzig lower-mountainous catchment and 67 sites in the Treene lowland catchment, and (2) flow conditions at these sites described by five flow metrics quantifying the duration, frequency, magnitude, timing and rate of flow events using present-day gauging data. Species' abundances were predicted for three periods: (1) baseline (1998-2017), (2) horizon 2050 (2046-2065) and (3) horizon 2090 (2080-2099) based on these empirical relationships and using high-resolution modeled discharge data for the present and future climate conditions. We compared the differences in predicted abundances among periods for individual species at each site, where the percent change served as a proxy to assess the potential species responses to flow alterations. Climate change was predicted to most strongly affect the low-flow conditions, leading to decreased abundances of species up to -42%. Finally combining the response of all species over all metrics indicated increasing overall species assemblage responses in 98% of the studied river reaches in both projected horizons and were significantly larger in the lower-mountainous Kinzig compared to the lowland Treene catchment. Such quantitative analyses of freshwater taxa responses to flow alterations provide valuable tools for predicting potential climate-change impacts on species abundances and can be applied to any stressor, species, or region."
"An organism's life history is closely interlinked with its allocation of energy between growth and reproduction at different life stages. Theoretical models have established that diminishing returns from reproductive investment promote strategies with simultaneous investment into growth and reproduction (indeterminate growth) over strategies with distinct phases of growth and reproduction (determinate growth). We extend this traditional, binary classification by showing that allocation-dependent fecundity and mortality rates allow for a large diversity of optimal allocation schedules. By analyzing a model of organisms that allocate energy between growth and reproduction, we find twelve types of optimal allocation schedules, differing qualitatively in how reproductive allocation increases with body mass. These twelve optimal allocation schedules include types with different combinations of continuous and discontinuous increase in reproduction allocation, in which phases of continuous increase can be decelerating or accelerating. We furthermore investigate how this variation influences growth curves and the expected maximum life span and body size. Our study thus reveals new links between eco-physiological constraints and life-history evolution and underscores how allocation-dependent fitness components may underlie biological diversity."
"Statistical analyses are an integral component of scientific research, and for decades, biologists have applied transformations to data to meet the normal error assumptions forFandttests. Over the years, there has been a movement from data transformation toward model reformation-the use of non-normal error structures within the framework of the generalized linear model (GLM). The principal advantage of model reformation is that parameters are estimated on the original, rather than the transformed scale. However, data transformation has been shown to give better control over type I error, for simulated data with known error structures. We conducted a literature review of statistical textbooks directed toward biologists and of journal articles published in the primary literature to determine temporal trends in both the text recommendations and the practice in the refereed literature over the past 35 years. In this review, a trend of increasing use of reformation in the primary literature was evident, moving from no use of reformation before 1996 to >50% of the articles reviewed applying GLM after 2006. However, no such trend was observed in the recommendations in statistical textbooks. We then undertook 12 analyses based on published datasets in which we compared the type I error estimates, residual plot diagnostics, and coefficients yielded by analyses using square root transformations, log transformations, and the GLM. All analyses yielded acceptable residual versus fit plots and had similarp-values within each analysis, but as expected, the coefficient estimates differed substantially. Furthermore, no consensus could be found in the literature regarding a procedure to back-transform the coefficient estimates obtained from linear models performed on transformed datasets. This lack of consistency among coefficient estimates constitutes a major argument for model reformation over data transformation in biology."
"Anthocyanin pigments have become a model trait for evolutionary ecology as they often provide adaptive benefits for plants. Anthocyanins have been traditionally quantified biochemically or more recently using spectral reflectance. However, both methods require destructive sampling and can be labor intensive and challenging with small samples. Recent advances in digital photography and image processing make it the method of choice for measuring color in the wild. Here, we use digital images as a quick, noninvasive method to estimate relative anthocyanin concentrations in species exhibiting color variation. Using a consumer-level digital camera and a free image processing toolbox, we extracted RGB values from digital images to generate color indices. We tested petals, stems, pedicels, and calyces of six species, which contain different types of anthocyanin pigments and exhibit different pigmentation patterns. Color indices were assessed by their correlation to biochemically determined anthocyanin concentrations. For comparison, we also calculated color indices from spectral reflectance and tested the correlation with anthocyanin concentration. Indices perform differently depending on the nature of the color variation. For both digital images and spectral reflectance, the most accurate estimates of anthocyanin concentration emerge from anthocyanin content-chroma ratio, anthocyanin content-chroma basic, and strength of green indices. Color indices derived from both digital images and spectral reflectance strongly correlate with biochemically determined anthocyanin concentration; however, the estimates from digital images performed better than spectral reflectance in terms ofr2and normalized root-mean-square error. This was particularly noticeable in a species with striped petals, but in the case of striped calyces, both methods showed a comparable relationship with anthocyanin concentration. Using digital images brings new opportunities to accurately quantify the anthocyanin concentrations in both floral and vegetative tissues. This method is efficient, completely noninvasive, applicable to both uniform and patterned color, and works with samples of any size."
"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of oregano essential oil (OEO) on the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex TLR 2/4 gene expression and depressive like behavior induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Sucrose preference and forced swim tests were adopted to examine the antidepressant effect. Control (CON), OEO, CUS, and CUS + OEO groups were used. The OEO and CUS + OEO groups received OEO (0.2 mL/kg, i.p.), CON and CUS received saline (0.2 mL/kg, i.p.), and the positive drug groups of CUS rats received fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) and diazepam (3 mg/kg) once daily for 14 days. The expression of TLR 2/4 was determined using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction with the SYBR green reporter dye. The compositions of the OEO were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The main constituents were thymol (20.72%), gamma-terpinene (8.83%), borneol (8.72%), cymene (6.83%), carvacrol (6.274%), alfa-terpinene (5.26%), and sabinene (4.92%). Administration of OEO significantly alleviated the depressive symptoms of CUS. A higher level of TLR2/4 mRNA was seen in the brain of CUS group (P< 0.05). The CUS-induced increases in the TLR2/4 levels were not reversed by OEO. According to the present study OEO may have the antidepressant-like activity but have no effect on the stress-induced TLR-2/4 upregulation."
"Most of the natural habitat in tropical regions exists as scattered fragments embedded in a matrix of different agricultural uses. As a result of this agricultural expansion, habitat loss and fragmentation have become the main drivers of biodiversity loss. Understanding the long-term effects of agricultural management on populations is of great importance for the development of successful conservation strategies. Our study uses genetic data to determine the effect of agricultural management practices on the population structure of a common tropical forest rodent (Heteromys desmarestianus goldmani). We sampled 136 individuals from one forest fragment and three coffee farms representing varying degrees of management intensity in southern Mexico. Using microsatellite markers, we evaluated the genetic structure ofH. d. goldmaniin the study area. Our results show higher genetic differentiation and lower connectivity for individuals within high and medium intensity coffee farms than for those near and within the forest fragments. Our results suggest that the population structure observed is driven by landscape characteristics other than distance."
"The postgenomic era is featured by massive data collection and analyses from various large scale-omics studies. Despite the promising capability of systems biology and bioinformatics to handle large data sets, data interpretation, especially the translation of -omics data into clinical implications, has been challenging.In this perspective, some important conceptual and technological limitations of current systems biology are discussed in the context of the ultimate importance of the genome beyond the collection of all genes. Following a brief summary of the contributions of molecular cytogenetics/cytogenomics in the pre- and post-genomic eras, new challenges for postgenomic research are discussed. Such discussion leads to a call to search for a new conceptual framework and holistic methodologies.Throughout this synthesis, the genome theory of somatic cell evolution is highlighted in contrast to gene theory, which ignores the karyotype-mediated higher level of genetic information. Since ""system inheritance"" is defined by the genome context (gene content and genomic topology) while ""parts inheritance"" is defined by genes/epigenes, molecular cytogenetics and cytogenomics (which directly study genome structure, function, alteration and evolution) will play important roles in this postgenomic era."
"The question how evolution and speciation work is one of the major interests of biology. Especially, genetic including karyotypic evolution within primates is of special interest due to the close phylogenetic position of Macaca and Homo sapiens and the role as in vivo models in medical research, neuroscience, behavior, pharmacology, reproduction and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).Karyotypes of five macaque species from South East Asia and of one macaque species as well as mandrill from Africa were analyzed by high resolution molecular cytogenetics to obtain new insights into karyotypic evolution of old world monkeys. Molecular cytogenetics applying human probes and probe sets was applied in chromosomes of Macaca arctoides, M. fascicularis, M. nemestrina, M. assamensis, M. sylvanus, M. mulatta and Mandrillus sphinx. Established two- to multicolor-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approaches were applied. Locus-specific probes, whole and partial chromosome paint probes were hybridized. Especially the FISH-banding approach multicolor-banding (MCB) as well as probes oriented towards heterochromatin turned out to be highly efficient for interspecies comparison.Karyotypes of all seven studied species could be characterized in detail. Surprisingly, no evolutionary conserved differences were found among macaques, including mandrill. Between the seven here studied and phenotypically so different species we expected several via FISH detectable karyoypic and submicroscopic changes and were surprised to find none of them on a molecular cytogenetic level. Spatial separation, may explain the speciation and different evolution for some of them, like African M. sylvanus, Mandrillus sphinx and the South Asian macaques. However, for the partially or completely overlapping habitats of the five studied South Asian macaques the species separation process can also not be deduced to karyotypic separation."
"This mini-review is devoted to the problem genetic meaning of main polytene chromosome structures - bands and interbands. Generally, densely packed chromatin forms black bands, moderately condensed regions form grey loose bands, whereas decondensed regions of the genome appear as interbands. Recent progress in the annotation of the Drosophila genome and epigenome has made it possible to compare the banding pattern and the structural organization of genes, as well as their activity. This was greatly aided by our ability to establish the borders of bands and interbands on the physical map, which allowed to perform comprehensive side-by-side comparisons of cytology, genetic and epigenetic maps and to uncover the association between the morphological structures and the functional domains of the genome. These studies largely conclude that interbands 5'-ends of housekeeping genes that are active across all cell types. Interbands are enriched with proteins involved in transcription and nucleosome remodeling, as well as with active histone modifications. Notably, most of the replication origins map to interband regions. As for grey loose bands adjacent to interbands, they typically host the bodies of house-keeping genes. Thus, the bipartite structure composed of an interband and an adjacent grey band functions as a standalone genetic unit. Finally, black bands harbor tissue-specific genes with narrow temporal and tissue expression profiles. Thus, the uniform and permanent activity of interbands combined with the inactivity of genes in bands forms the basis of the universal banding pattern observed in various Drosophila tissues."
"Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The poor prognosis of this disease highlights the urgent need to develop more effective therapies. Activation of the STAT3 represents a potential drug target for pancreatic cancer therapy. Currently, clinically available small-molecule inhibitors targeting STAT3 are lacking.Through bioassay screening and molecular docking, we identified a small molecule L61H46 that can potently target constitutive STAT3 signaling and kill human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.L61H46 effectively reduced colony formation and the viability of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in the range between 0.86 and 2.83 µM. L61H46 significantly inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation (Tyr705) and the subsequent nucleus translocation but did not downregulate STAT1 phosphorylation. Moreover, L61H46 demonstrated a potent activity in suppressing pancreatic tumor growth in BXPC-3 xenograft model in vivo. Furthermore, L61H46 showed no signs of adverse effects on liver, heart, and kidney cells in vivo.Collectively, our results suggest that L61H46 could be further optimized into a highly potent STAT3 inhibitor for the treatment of pancreatic cancer."
"Melanin and manganese are both indispensable natural substances that play crucial roles in the human body. Melanin has been used as a multimodality imaging nanoplatform for biology science research because of its natural binding ability with metal ions (eg,64Cu2+, Fe3+, and Gd3+). Because of its effects on T1 signal enhancement, Mn-based nanoparticles have been used in magnetic resonance (MR) quantitative cell tracking in vivo. Stem cell tracking in vivo is an essential technology used to characterize engrafted stem cells, including cellular viability, biodistribution, differentiation capacity, and long-term fate.In the present study, manganese(II) ions chelated to melanin nanoparticles [MNP-Mn(II)] were synthesized. The characteristics, stem cell labeling efficiency, and cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles were evaluated. MR imaging of the labeled stem cells in vivo and in vitro were also further performed. In T1 relaxivity (r1), MNP-Mn(II) were significantly more abundant than Omniscan. Bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) can be labeled easily by coincubating with MNP-Mn(II), suggesting that MNP-Mn(II) had high biocompatibility.Cell Counting Kit-8 assays revealed that MNP-Mn(II) had almost no cytotoxicity when used to label BMSCs, even with a very high concentration (1,600 µg/mL). BMSCs labeled with MNP-Mn(II) could generate a hyperintense T1 signal both in vitro and in vivo, and the hyperintense T1 signal in vivo persisted for at least 28 days.Taken together, our results showed that MNP-Mn(II) possessed many excellent properties for potential quantitative stem cell tracking in vivo."
"The aim of the research genetic study was to investigate the association between variants (C1431T and Pro12Ala) of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARgamma-2) gene, Trp64Arg polymorphism of the beta-3-adrenergic receptor gene and lipid profile in Polish population including group of 103 patients with connective tissue disease (CTD) and 103 sex-and age-matched controls in context of statin use.Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured by routine methods, followed by genotyping (TagMan®Genotyping Assays, PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis). Nearly 30% of CTD patients used statins and 10% of the control group.Although there were no differences between alleles and genotypes prevalence between CTD vs control groups, interesting lipid-gene associations were noted in this study. A higher level of triglycerides (TAG) and TAG/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratios was observed in CTD patients compared to controls. Similar differences were noted in CTD and control groups without statin treatment. Atherogenic markers: the atherogenic index of plasma, TAG/HDL and low-density lipoprotein/HDL ratio were low in the analyzed groups. Of the six analyzed polymorphisms, the Pro12Pro or C14131C or Trp64Trp genotypes were related to higher TAG and TAG/HDL ratios in patients with CTD; however, the highest TAG values were observed in the presence of the Trp64Trp genotype.Lipid disorders were present in both groups independent of statin treatment (mixed dyslipidemia and hypercholesterolemia were observed in the CTD and control groups, respectively). The risk of dyslipidemia increases with age. The presence of Pro12Pro, C14131C and Trp64Trp genotypes is related to higher TAG level in CTDs, and of these the Trp64Trp variant most reliably predicts hypertriglyceridemia."
"Scents play an important role in the life of most terrestrial mammals and may transmit valuable information about conspecifics. Olfaction was long considered of low importance in Old World monkeys due to their relative reduction of olfactory structures and low incidence of scent-marking behavior but has been increasingly recognized for mediating social relationships in recent years. Yet, studies investigating the composition of their chemical cues remain scarce. In the present study, we analyzed the potential information content of chemicals present on the skin of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). We collected axillary secretions from 60 animals of the semifree-ranging population on Cayo Santiago (Puerto Rico, USA) with precleaned cotton swabs from which the secretions were subsequently extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Rhesus macaque axillary odorants varied in their overall similarity and composition. This variation was attributable to differences in sex, group membership, and kinship and further appeared to reflect age and rank in parts of our sample. The compounds most strongly associated with this variation primarily comprised larger molecular weight aldehydes and steroids. Such compounds are considered to be perceivable by the primate olfactory system through close-range interactions or through breakdown into smaller molecules by bacterial fermentation. Overall, our results provide additional evidence that odors of Old World monkeys reflect a wealth of potential information about their carrier, which provides the basis for chemical communication via body odors; however, its use by conspecifics needs to be confirmed in bioassays.One prerequisite for olfactory communication is the presence of systematic variation in animal odors that is related to attributes such as age, sex, or kinship. The composition of odors has been examined in numerous mammals but, with the exception of humans, remains poorly understood in Old World monkeys and apes, taxonomic groups in which most species do not show scent-marking behavior. In the present study, we show that the composition of axillary secretions of an Old World monkey, the rhesus macaque, reflects sex, group membership, relatedness, and possibly also age and rank. This variation thus provides a basis for olfactory communication in Old World monkeys."
"Predation is a ubiquitous threat that often plays a central role in determining community dynamics. Predators can impact prey species by directly consuming them, or indirectly causing prey to modify their behavior. Direct consumption has classically been the focus of research on predator-prey interactions, but substantial evidence now demonstrates that the indirect effects of predators on prey populations are at least as strong as, if not stronger than, direct consumption. Social animals, particularly those that live in confined colonies, rely on coordinated actions that may be vulnerable to the presence of a predator, thus impacting the society's productivity and survival. To examine the effect of predators on the behavior of social animal societies, we observed the collective foraging of social spider colonies (Stegodyphus dumicola) when they interact with dangerous predatory ants either directly, indirectly, or both. We found that when colonies were exposed directly and indirectly to ant cues, they attacked prey with approximately 40-50% fewer spiders, and 40-90% slower than colonies that were not exposed to any predator cues. Furthermore, exposure to predatory ants disassociated the well-documented positive relationship between colony behavioral composition (proportion of bold spiders) and foraging aggressiveness (number of attackers) inS.dumicola, which is vital for colony growth. Thus, the indirect effects of predator presence may limit colony success. These results suggest that enemy presence could compromise the organizational attributes of animal societies."
"The objective of this study was to optimize the extraction of protein by applying a multi-enzymatic pretreatment to okara, a byproduct from soymilk processing. The multi-enzyme complex Viscozyme, containing a variety of carbohydrases, was used to hydrolyze the okara cell walls and facilitate extraction of proteins. Enzyme-assisted extraction was carried out under different temperatures (37-53 °C), enzyme concentrations (1.5-4%) and pH values (5.5-6.5) according to a central composite rotatable design. After extraction, the protein was concentrated by isoelectric precipitation. The optimal conditions for maximum protein content and recovery in protein concentrate were 53 °C, pH 6.2 and 4% of enzyme concentration. Under these conditions, protein content of 56% (dry weight basis) and a recovery of 28% were obtained, representing an increase of 17 and 86%, respectively, compared to the sample with no enzymatic pretreatment. The multi-enzyme complex Viscozyme hydrolyzed the structural cell wall polysaccharides, improving extraction and obtaining protein concentrate from the okara. An electrophoretic profile of the protein concentrate showed two distinct bands, corresponding to the acidic and basic subunits of the protein glycinin. There were no limiting amino acids in the protein concentrate, which had a greater content of arginine."
"TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae TEL1gene is an ortholog of the humanATM(Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene.S. cerevisiae tel1mutant (tel1?) lacking Tel1p, share some of the cellular defects withATMmutation that includes prevention of oxidative damage repair, premature aging and apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of quercetin on the sensitivity of yeastS. cerevisiae tel1?cells exposed to oxidative, apoptotic and DNA damaging stress and viability oftel1?cells during chronological aging. Quercetin improved the stress resistance oftel1? cells when challenged with oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), menadine bisulphite (MBS) and tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Quercetin protected thetel1?cells from acetic acid-induced apoptotic cell death and sensitivity against hydroxyurea. We found that quercetin attenuated ROS accumulation and apoptotic markers intel1?cells and therefore an increase in cell viability during chronological aging. Our results from theS. cerevisiaemodel, suggest that use of quercetin as a food supplement might alleviate oxidative stress mediated DNA damage, apoptosis and age related damaging effects in AT patients and also improve health beneficial effects in humans."
"Saffron quality is commonly determined by three parameters: color, aroma, and taste. Several factors including harvesting and post-harvesting conditions, affect these parameters. In this study, the effect of storage time on saffron quality was evaluated. At first, the relative concentration of the saffron secondary metabolites in freshly dried and 2 years stored saffron samples prepared with ISO 3632 and UA-DLLME methods and then measured using UV-Vis and GC-FID techniques. In order to find saffron storage time biomarkers, the obtained data were subjected to several data analysis steps including data preprocessing, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and variable selection methods. Based on the obtained main biomarkers and proposed molecule mechanism, it can be concluded that during the storage periods, the intensity of saffron color reduces, while its aroma increases, reflecting a negative correlation between them. Freshly dried samples have a higher level of the crocins as coloring agents, ?-isophorone, 4-hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohex-2-enone and picrocrocin, while the stored samples were more abundant by safranal as the main saffron aroma agent."
"The aim of this work was to explore the possibility of the application of cloud point extraction (CPE) method in micelle media to recovery betaine from beet molasses. Response surface method was employed to assess the effects of surfactant concentration, molasses concentration, incubation time, pH, electrolyte concentration, mixing time, and surfactant type on efficiency of betaine recovery from beet molasses. Also, a mathematical model was developed to predict the effect of each variable and their interactions on the efficiency of betaine recovery. The model showed that best surfactant was Triton X-114 and under the optimum conditions, betaine recovery from beet molasses was achieved up to 80% when three CPE steps with total of 1.5% (w/v) of surfactant were used. Subsequently, betaine was recovered nearly 100% from surfactant rich phase after adjusting pH at 2.5 and re-incubation at 40 °C. The results showed that the proposed method is suitable for extraction of betaine from beet molasses."
"BACKGROUND This report presents therapeutic decision-making and management of refractory, life-threatening duodenal bleeding in a young man with recurrent metastatic retroperitoneal paraganglioma. CASE REPORT The patient had been symptom free for 8 years after radioactive MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) therapy. Failure of endoscopic or angiographic bleeding control led to urgent need to evaluate possible endocrine functional status, tumor curability, safety of incomplete resection, intra- and postoperative support needs, and anticipated recovery potential and postoperative function. Aside from these considerations, impact of tumor biology, alternative therapeutic options, current management guidelines, and ethical challenges of resource utilization for such complex palliative operative intervention were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS Based on the observed outcomes after an urgent presentation of an unusual tumor-related complication, palliation-intent therapy was justifiable even if significant treatment-related risks were expected and complex resources were required."
"Admissions committees in dental schools are charged with the responsibility of selecting candidates who will succeed in school and become successful members of the profession. Identifying students who will have academic difficulty is challenging. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of pre-admission variables for the first-year performance of six classes at one U.S. dental school. The authors hypothesized that the variables undergraduate grade point average (GPA), undergraduate science GPA (biology, chemistry, and physics), and Dental Admission Test (DAT) scores would predict the level of performance achieved in the first year of dental school, measured by year-end GPA. Data were collected in 2015 from school records for all 297 students in the six cohorts who completed the first year (Classes of 2007 through 2013). In the results, statistically significant correlations existed between all pre-admission variables and first-year GPA, but the associations were only weak to moderate. Lower performing students at the end of the first year (lowest 10% of GPA) had, on average, lower pre-admission variables than the other students, but the differences were small (?10.8% in all categories). When all the pre-admission variables were considered together in a multiple regression analysis, a significant association was found between pre-admission variables and first-year GPA, but the association was weak (adjusted R2=0.238). This weak association suggests that these students' first-year dental school GPAs were mostly determined by factors other than the pre-admission variables studied and has resulted in the school's placing greater emphasis on other factors for admission decisions."
"The aim of this study was to determine if lower scores on the Perceptual Ability Test (PAT) of the Dental Admission Test (DAT) predicted which dental students required remediation in three preclinical restorative dentistry courses at Rutgers School of Dental Medicine. The academic records of 489 dental students from the graduating Classes of 2010 through 2015 were evaluated. The results showed that, for all three courses (Preclinical General Dentistry I, Preclinical General Dentistry II, and Preclinical Fixed Prosthodontics), the remediating students had significantly lower mean PAT scores than did the passing students. A one-unit decrease in a student's PAT score was associated with a 43% increase in the odds of remediating the Preclinical General Dentistry I lab, a 29% increase in the odds of remediating the Preclinical Fixed Prosthodontics lab, and a 47% increase in the odds of remediating the Preclinical General Dentistry II lab. The mean PAT score for passing students was 18.84 (standard deviation 2.35), and the mean PAT score for students requiring remediation was 17.03 (standard deviation 2.18). Studies like this can be useful because if students at risk of failing these courses are identified early and appropriate supports are provided, the need for remediation may be reduced if not eliminated."
"This Point/Counterpoint considers whether providing dental students with academic career training and teaching experiences during their predoctoral education would be valuable to recruit dental academicians. While training the next generation of dentists continues to be the primary focus for dental schools, the cultivation and recruitment of dental faculty members from the pool of dental students remain challenges. Viewpoint 1 supports the position that providing dental students with exposure to academic career opportunities has positive value in recruiting new dental faculty. The advantages of academic careers training as a required educational experience in dental schools and as a potential means to recruit dental students into the ranks of faculty are described in this viewpoint. In contrast, Viewpoint 2 contends that such career exposure has limited value and argues that, across the board, allocation of resources to support preparation for academic careers would have a poor cost-benefit return on investment. Adding a requirement for educational experiences for all students would overburden institutions, students, and faculty according to this viewpoint. The authors agree that research is needed to determine how and where to make predoctoral curricular changes that will have maximum impact on academic recruitment."
"In human pancreatic islets, the neurotransmitter ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an extracellular signaling molecule synthesized by and released from the insulin-secreting ? cells. The effective, physiological GABA concentration range within human islets is unknown. Here we use native GABAAreceptors in human islet ? cells as biological sensors and reveal that 100-1000nM GABA elicit the maximal opening frequency of the single-channels. In saturating GABA, the channels desensitized and stopped working. GABA modulated insulin exocytosis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. GABAAreceptor currents were enhanced by the benzodiazepine diazepam, the anesthetic propofol and the incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) but not affected by the hypnotic zolpidem. In type 2 diabetes (T2D) islets, single-channel analysis revealed higher GABA affinity of the receptors. The findings reveal unique GABAAreceptors signaling in human islets ? cells that is GABA concentration-dependent, differentially regulated by drugs, modulates insulin secretion and is altered in T2D."
"Depending on the length of their carbon backbone and their saturation status, natural fatty acids have rather distinct biological effects. Thus, longevity of model organisms is increased by extra supply of the most abundant natural cis-unsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid, but not by that of the most abundant saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid. Here, we systematically compared the capacity of different saturated, cis-unsaturated and alien (industrial or ruminant) trans-unsaturated fatty acids to provoke cellular stress in vitro, on cultured human cells expressing a battery of distinct biosensors that detect signs of autophagy, Golgi stress and the unfolded protein response. In contrast to cis-unsaturated fatty acids, trans-unsaturated fatty acids failed to stimulate signs of autophagy including the formation of GFP-LC3B-positive puncta, production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, and activation of the transcription factor TFEB. When combined effects were assessed, several trans-unsaturated fatty acids including elaidic acid (the trans-isomer of oleate), linoelaidic acid, trans-vaccenic acid and palmitelaidic acid, were highly efficient in suppressing autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by palmitic, but not by oleic acid. Elaidic acid also inhibited autophagy induction by palmitic acid in vivo, in mouse livers and hearts. We conclude that the well-established, though mechanistically enigmatic toxicity of trans-unsaturated fatty acids may reside in their capacity to abolish cytoprotective stress responses induced by saturated fatty acids."
"The raccoon (Procyon lotor) and the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) belong to a group of the invasive species. The introduced species as potential reservoirs for vector-borne pathogens have been the subject of recent research, though there are still no data with reference to the European population of the raccoon, and few studies concern only the raccoon dog. This study shows the occurrence of Anaplasmataceae representatives in raccoons and a sympatric population of the raccoon dogs obtained from the area of Poland and Germany. During the study, the occurrence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum ecotype I in the introduced raccoon in northwestern Poland was revealed. Additionally, Candidatus Neoehrlichia sp. (FU98) was identified for the first time in the raccoon dog in Central Europe and thereby the raccoon dog is a new host for this pathogen."
"The derivation of microglia from human stem cells provides systems for understanding microglial biology and enables functional studies of disease-causing mutations. We describe a robust method for the derivation of human microglia from stem cells, which are phenotypically and functionally comparable with primary microglia. We used stem cell-derived microglia to study the consequences of missense mutations in the microglial-expressed protein triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which are causal for frontotemporal dementia-like syndrome and Nasu-Hakola disease. We find that mutant TREM2 accumulates in its immature form, does not undergo typical proteolysis, and is not trafficked to the plasma membrane. However, in the absence of plasma membrane TREM2, microglia differentiate normally, respond to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, and are phagocytically competent. These data indicate that dementia-associated TREM2 mutations have subtle effects on microglia biology, consistent with the adult onset of disease in individuals with these mutations."
"Disorders of the biliary epithelium, known as cholangiopathies, cause severe and irreversible liver diseases. The limited accessibility of bile duct precludes modeling of several cholangiocyte-mediated diseases. Therefore, novel approaches for obtaining functional cholangiocytes with high purity are needed. Previous work has shown that the combination of Hnf1? and Foxa3 could directly convert mouse fibroblasts into bipotential hepatic stem cell-like cells, termed iHepSCs. However, the efficiency of converting fibroblasts into iHepSCs is low, and these iHepSCs exhibit extremely low differentiation potential into cholangiocytes, thus hindering the translation of iHepSCs to the clinic. Here, we describe that the expression of Hnf1? and Foxa3 dramatically facilitates the robust generation of iHepSCs. Notably, prolonged in vitro culture of Hnf1?- and Foxa3-derived iHepSCs induces a Notch signaling-mediated secondary conversion into cholangiocyte progenitor-like cells that display dramatically enhanced differentiation capacity into mature cholangiocytes. Our study provides a robust two-step approach for obtaining cholangiocyte progenitor-like cells using defined factors."
"Chimeric mice have been generated by injecting pluripotent stem cells into morula-to-blastocyst stage mouse embryo or by introducing more mature cells into later stage embryos that correspond to the differentiation stage of the donor cells. It has not been rigorously tested, however, whether successful chimera formation requires the developmental stage of host embryo and donor cell to be matched. Here, we compared the success of chimera formation following injection of primary neural crest cells (NCCs) into blastocysts or of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into E8.5 embryos (heterochronic injection) with that of injecting ESCs cells into the blastocyst or NCCs into the E8.5 embryos (isochronic injection). Chimera formation was efficient when donor and host were matched, but no functional chimeric contribution was found in heterochronic injections. This suggests that matching the developmental stage of donor cells with the host embryo is crucial for functional engraftment of donor cells into the developing embryo."
"Loss of a cell's ability to terminally differentiate because of mutations is a selected genetic event in tumorigenesis. Genomic analyses of low-grade glioma have reported recurrent mutations of far upstream element-binding protein 1 (FUBP1). Here, we show that FUBP1 expression is dynamically regulated during neurogenesis and that its downregulation in neural progenitors impairs terminal differentiation and promotes tumorigenesis collaboratively with expression of IDH1R132H. Mechanistically, collaborative action between SRRM4 and FUBP1 is necessary for mini-exon splicing of the neurospecific LSD1+8a isoform. LSD1+8a was downregulated upon loss of FUBP1 in neural progenitors, thereby impairing terminal neuronal differentiation and maturation. Reinforcing LSD1+8a expression in FUBP1-downregulated neural progenitors restored terminal differentiation and suppressed tumorigenesis; hence, LSD1+8a is an obligatory effector of FUBP1-dependent neuronal differentiation. These findings establish a direct role for FUBP1 in neuronal differentiation and also explain its tumor-suppressor function in the nervous system."
"Phthalates, endocrine-disrupting chemicals that are commonly found in consumer products, may adversely affect thyroid hormones, but findings from prior epidemiologic studies are inconsistent.In a prospective cohort study, we investigated whether maternal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and phthalate mixtures measured during pregnancy were associated with thyroid hormones among pregnant women and newborns.We measured nine phthalate metabolites [monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate, mono-isobutyl phthalate, monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and four monoesthers of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate] in urine collected at approximately 16 and 26 weeks' gestation among women in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment Study (2003-2006, Cincinnati, Ohio). Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free and total thyroxine and triiodothyronine were measured in maternal serum at 16 weeks' gestation (n?=?202) and cord serum at delivery (n?=?276). We used multivariable linear regression to assess associations between individual urinary phthalate metabolites and concentrations of maternal or cord serum thyroid hormones. We used weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) to create a phthalate index describing combined concentrations of phthalate metabolites and to investigate associations of the phthalate index with individual thyroid hormones.With each 10-fold increase in 16-week maternal urinary MEP, maternal serum total thyroxine (TT4) decreased by 0.52??g/dL (95% CI: -1.01, -0.03). For each 10-fold increase in average (16- and 26-week) maternal urinary MBzP, cord serum TSH decreased by 19% (95% CI: -33.1, -1.9). Among mothers, the phthalate index was inversely associated with maternal serum TT4(WQS beta?=?-0.60; 95% CI: -1.01, -0.18). Among newborns, the phthalate index was inversely associated with both cord serum TSH (WQS beta?=?-0.11; 95% CI: -0.20, -0.03) and TT4(WQS beta?=?-0.53; 95% CI: -0.90, -0.16).Our results suggest that co-exposure to multiple phthalates was inversely associated with certain thyroid hormones (TT4in pregnant women and newborns, and TSH in newborns) in this birth cohort. These findings highlight the need to study chemical mixtures in environmental epidemiology."
"Muscle stem cells undergo a dramatic metabolic switch to oxidative phosphorylation during differentiation, which is achieved by massively increased mitochondrial activity. Since expression of the muscle-specific miR-1/133a gene cluster correlates with increased mitochondrial activity during muscle stem cell (MuSC) differentiation, we examined the potential role of miR-1/133a in metabolic maturation of skeletal muscles in mice. We found that miR-1/133a downregulate Mef2A in differentiated myocytes, thereby suppressing the Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster, which encodes multiple microRNAs inhibiting expression of mitochondrial genes. Loss of miR-1/133a in skeletal muscles or increased Mef2A expression causes continuous high-level expression of the Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster, compromising mitochondrial function. Failure to terminate the stem cell-like metabolic program characterized by high-level Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster expression initiates profound changes in muscle physiology, essentially abrogating endurance running. Our results suggest a major role of miR-1/133a in metabolic maturation of skeletal muscles but exclude major functions in muscle development and MuSC maintenance."
"We distinguish two types of predations: the predation of matter-energy equals the food chain, and the informative predation is the capture of the information brought by the sexual partners. The cell or parent consumes energy and matter to grow, multiply and produce offspring. A fixed amount of resources is divided by the number of organisms, so individual growth and numerical multiplication are limited by depletion resources of the environment. Inversely, fertilization does not destroy information, but instead produces news. The information is multiplied by the number of partners and children, since each fertilization gives rise to a new genome following a combinatorial process that continues without exhaustion. The egg does not swallow the sperm to feed, but exchange good food for quality information. With the discovery of sex, that is, 1.5 Ga ago, life added soft predation to hard predation, i.e. information production within each species to matter-energy flow between species. Replicative and informative structures are subject to two competing biological constraints: replicative fidelity promotes proliferation, but limits adaptive evolution. On the contrary, the offspring of a couple obviously cannot be a copy of both partners, they are a new production, a re-production. Sexual recombination allows the exponential enrichment of the genetic diversity, thus promoting indefinite adaptive and evolutionary capacities. Evolutionary history illustrates this: the bacteria proliferate but have remained at the first purely nutritive stage in which most of the sensory functions, mobility, defense, and feeding have experienced almost no significant novelty in three billion years. Another world appeared with the sexual management of information. Sexual reproduction actually combines two functions: multiplicative by ""vertical transfer"" and informative by ""horizontal transfer"". This distinction is very common: polypus - medusa alternations, parasite multiplication cycles, the lytochal and deuterotochal parthenogenesis of aphids, and the innumerable para- and pseudo-sexual strategies of plants opportunistically combine the two modes of asexual replication and sexual combination. However, for the majority of animals and multicellular plants that produce many gametes, numerical proliferation by descendants and informative diversity by sexuality are mutually implicated, for example in the seed. The true discovery of eukaryotes may not be the ""true nucleus"", as their name implies, but an orderly informative function. The field of recombinations circumscribes a class of partners genetically compatible with each other, each simultaneously prey and predator of the DNA of the other. The mythical Maxwell demon capable of tracing entropy by sorting molecules according to their state does exist: each mate is the other's Maxwell's demon. While a sexless bacterium is simply divided into two cells, two sexual parents work together to produce a single offspring a time. Added to this are the burdens involved in meiosis and crossing-over, cellular diploidy, and mating. Sex produces an information gain that is paid for by a cost of energy-material, and this barter must be fair to survive. The domains of sexual intercourse are very diverse: uniparental reproduction, alternation of asexual proliferation and sexual information, self-fertilization, endogamy, exogamy, panmixis, diffuse or structured polymorphism, fertile or sterile hybridization, horizontal transfers. Each species is a recombination field between two domains, cloning and hybridization. Multiplicative descent and informative fertilization are organically distinct, but selectively associated: the information produced by the parents' sexuality favors the predation of matter-energy and therefore the proliferation of offspring, and this proliferation in turn favors the sexed producers of information. The equation specific to each species is: enough energy to proliferate, enough information to diversify. Alternatively, two other reproductive modes obtain or transmit less information at lower cost: not enough recombinations=repetitive clonal proliferation, and too many recombinations=disordered hybridization. But these marginal modes have poor prospects, as the model of the species is successfully attractive. Better discriminate to better inform. In bacteria, the exchanged and incorporated DNA segments are directly identified by the parity of the complementary strands, which determines simultaneously the similarity, the offspring, and the pairing. In eukaryotes, on the contrary, somatic growth and germinal information are segregated. During speciation, adaptive information is compacted, delocalized, codified and published to inform the species about its own state: the prezygotic relationship governs viable mating. Under the effect of sexual selection, the runaway and the reinforcement of the characters related to courtship testifies to their identifying function, which explains the paradox of the singularity and luxuriance of the sexual hypertrophies. The speciation discretizes a balanced recombination field and validates the informative relations. The species is without degree. Mates of a species recognize each other quickly and well because the logic of coding disengages from the ecological game of adaptations. The system of mate recognition has a function of cohesion and its regularity allows the adaptations of the less regular being, it is neither elitist nor normative, it is subjected neither to a level of aptitudes, nor to sexual performances, but permissive; it protects the variability and polymorphism. Two mutually irreducible relationships triggered the debate between the taxonomists who support the phyletic definition of the species by the descendance, and the proponents of the definition by interfertility. Such a taxonomic disagreement is not insurmountable, but the issue is deeper than taxonomic concepts, because these concepts relate to two different modes of evolution. According to the phyletic model, each species is a lineage passively isolated by external circumstances; on the contrary, in the sexual model each species is actively produced by an internal process of adjustment between replicative costs and informative gains. Each species develops a solution of the equation that matches material-energy expenditures with informative gains. A species concept based on a lasting relationship between these two quantities or on the limits of certain values or their equilibrium is therefore legitimate. It is this equilibrium that all couples resolve, without our formulation being as clearly as biology desires and as physics demands. Energy expenditures and informative gains in sexuality are almost impossible to measure, yet observation and experience allow an approximate ranking of the energy/information ratio. For example, endogamy is more economical, but less diversifying than exogamy, polymorphism increases information, the reinforcement of sexual isolation limits the rate of unproductive fertilization, between neighboring species hybridization allows certain genetic contributions, etc. A closed species evolves naturally towards another just as closed. On the contrary, the artificial transfer of DNA opens the species. The natural boundaries that isolate the species are easily trespassed as energy costs and constraints of sexual recognition are easily controlled; and the perspectives of manipulations are visible, whereas natural selection never anticipates and thus works blindly. Informative, artificially directed predation stimulates the evolution of species."
"Secretory preproteins carry signal peptides fused amino-terminally to mature domains. They are post-translationally targeted to cross the plasma membrane in non-folded states with the help of translocases, and fold only at their final destinations. The mechanism of this process of postponed folding is unknown, but is generally attributed to signal peptides and chaperones. We herein demonstrate that, during targeting, most mature domains maintain loosely packed folding intermediates. These largely soluble states are signal peptide independent and essential for translocase recognition. These intermediates are promoted by mature domain features: residue composition, elevated disorder, and reduced hydrophobicity. Consequently, a mature domain folds slower than its cytoplasmic structural homolog. Some mature domains could not evolve stable, loose intermediates, and hence depend on signal peptides for slow folding to the detriment of solubility. These unique features of secretory proteins impact our understanding of protein trafficking, folding, and aggregation, and thus place them in a distinct class."
"The function of the human cardiac sodium channel (NaV1.5) is modulated by the Ca2+sensor calmodulin (CaM), but the underlying mechanism(s) are controversial and poorly defined. CaM has been reported to bind in a Ca2+-dependent manner to two sites in the intracellular loop that is critical for inactivation of NaV1.5 (inactivation gate [IG]). The affinity of CaM for the complete IG was significantly stronger than that of fragments that lacked both complete binding sites. Structural analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallographic, and scattering approaches revealed that CaM simultaneously engages both IG sites using an extended configuration. Patch-clamp recordings for wild-type and mutant channels with an impaired CaM-IG interaction revealed CaM binding to the IG promotes recovery from inactivation while impeding the kinetics of inactivation. Models of full-length NaV1.5 suggest that CaM binding to the IG directly modulates channel function by destabilizing the inactivated state, which would promote resetting of the IG after channels close."
"Recent advances in instrumentation and image-processing software have resulted in a resolution revolution in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and a surge in the popularity of this technique. However, despite technical progress and hundreds of structures determined so far, development of standards assessing the agreement between the cryo-EM map and the respective model has fallen behind. Here we establish a validation procedure evaluating this agreement and applied it to a set of 565 cryo-EM structures. Analysis of the results revealed that three-quarters of the validated structures exhibit moderate or low agreement between the map and the corresponding model, mostly due to limited structural features possessed by these maps. Model re-refinement significantly improved the agreement for only one-fifth of the structures, reaffirming the necessity to re-evaluate map resolution. The presented procedure provides an approach to re-estimate the resolution of cryo-EM map areas interpreted by the model."
"How remote enhancers interact with appropriate target genes persists as a central mystery in gene regulation. Here, we exploit the properties of transvection to explore enhancer-promoter communication between homologous chromosomes in living Drosophila embryos. We successfully visualized the activation of an MS2-tagged reporter gene by a defined developmental enhancer located in trans on the other homolog. This trans-homolog activation depends on insulator DNAs, which increase the stability-but not the frequency-of homolog pairing. A pair of heterotypic insulators failed to mediate transvection, raising the possibility that insulator specificity underlies the formation of chromosomal loop domains. Moreover, we found that a shared enhancer co-activates separate PP7 and MS2 reporter genes incis and intrans. Transvecting alleles weakly compete with one another, raising the possibility that they share a common pool of the transcription machinery. We propose that transvecting alleles form a trans-homolog ""hub,"" which serves as a scaffold for the accumulation of transcription complexes."
"Fidaxomicin is an antibacterial drug in clinical use for treatment of Clostridium difficile diarrhea. The active ingredient of fidaxomicin, lipiarmycin A3 (Lpm), functions by inhibiting bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here we report a cryo-EM structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNAP holoenzyme in complex with Lpm at 3.5-Å resolution. The structure shows that Lpm binds at the base of the RNAP ""clamp."" The structure exhibits an open conformation of the RNAP clamp, suggesting that Lpm traps an open-clamp state. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments confirm that Lpm traps an open-clamp state and define effects of Lpm on clamp dynamics. We suggest that Lpm inhibits transcription by trapping an open-clamp state, preventing simultaneous interaction with promoter -10 and -35 elements. The results account for the absence of cross-resistance between Lpm and other RNAP inhibitors, account for structure-activity relationships of Lpm derivatives, and enable structure-based design of improved Lpm derivatives."
"Chemical and biochemical analyses of one of the most basic nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) from a Pseudomonas fluorescens strain revealed its striking plasticity. Determination of the potential substrate scope enabled us to anticipate novel secondary metabolites that could subsequently be isolated and tested for their bioactivities. Detailed analyses of the monomodular pyreudione synthetase showed that the biosynthesis of the bacterial pyreudione alkaloids does not require additional biosynthetic enzymes. Heterologous expression of a similar and functional, yet cryptic, NRPS of Pseudomonas entomophila was successful and allowed us to perform a phylogenetic analysis of their thioesterase domains."
"O-linked ?-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) regulates protein O-GlcNAcylation, an essential post-translational modification that is abundant in the brain. Recently, OGT mutations have been associated with intellectual disability, although it is not understood how they affect OGT structure and function. Using a multi-disciplinary approach we show that the L254F OGT mutation leads to conformational changes of the tetratricopeptide repeats and reduced activity, revealing the molecular mechanisms contributing to pathogenesis."
"Intracellular signals triggered by DNA breakage flow through proteins containing BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminal) domains. This family, comprising 23 conserved phosphopeptide-binding modules in man, is inaccessible to small-molecule chemical inhibitors. Here, we develop Bractoppin, a drug-like inhibitor of phosphopeptide recognition by the human BRCA1 tandem (t)BRCT domain, which selectively inhibits substrate binding with nanomolar potency in vitro. Structure-activity exploration suggests that Bractoppin engages BRCA1 tBRCT residues recognizing pSer in the consensus motif, pSer-Pro-Thr-Phe, plus an abutting hydrophobic pocket that is distinct in structurally related BRCT domains, conferring selectivity. In cells, Bractoppin inhibits substrate recognition detected by Förster resonance energy transfer, and diminishes BRCA1 recruitment to DNA breaks, in turn suppressing damage-induced G2 arrest and assembly of the recombinase, RAD51. But damage-induced MDC1 recruitment, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generation, and TOPBP1 recruitment remain unaffected. Thus, an inhibitor of phosphopeptide recognition selectively interrupts BRCA1 tBRCT-dependent signals evoked by DNA damage."
"While sexual activity in normal, healthy pregnant women is safe, concern regarding elements of the sexual act have led to restrictions in pregnancies experiencing complications that are frequently insufficiently addressed in clinical practice.To comprehensively review the literature for evidence that supports or refutes specific sexual activity restrictions in high-risk pregnancy conditions.A search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Ovid, UpToDate, Google Scholar, and Google for relevant publications related to any aspect of sexual activity affecting high-risk pregnancies complicated by history of pre-term delivery, shortened cervix, presence of cerclage, pre-mature rupture of membranes, placenta abruption, placenta previa, multiple gestation, or history of classical cesarean section was performed.The scientific evidence on the pathophysiology of sexual activity and specific high-risk pregnancies, and their interaction.Despite expert opinion restricting sexual acts or intercourse, there are minimal published data that specifically address sexual activity in high-risk pregnancies.Clinicians need to engage in conversations regarding specific sexual activity for patients experiencing complications in pregnancy. Recommendations for or against restricting sexual activity should be based on evidence-based guidelines. Significant advances in this area of obstetrics are necessary to make validated recommendations. MacPhedran S. Sexual Activity Recommendations in High-Risk Pregnancies: What is the Evidence?

"The EORTC phase III 26053-22054/ RTOG 0834/NCIC CTG CEC.1/CATNON intergroup trial was designed to evaluate the impact on concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy in newly diagnosed non-1p/19q deleted anaplastic gliomas. The primary endpoint was overall survival. We report the results of retrospective individual case reviews (ICRs) for the first patient randomized per institution to detect the compliance with the study protocol.Sixty-nine institutions were required to submit the radiotherapy plan of their first randomized patient. Full digital datasets uploaded to the EORTC server were assessed by three independent and blinded reviewers through the EORTC radiotherapy quality assurance platform.Sixty-two (90%) of sixty-nine ICRs were received and assessable. Of the 62 cases, 22 were evaluated as per protocol (35.5%), 11 as acceptable variation (17.7%) and 29 were classified as unacceptable variations (46.8%). Most common unacceptable variations were related to the PTV dose (n?=?19, 31%) and delineation (n?=?17, 27%) processes.The ICR analysis showed a significant number of unacceptable variations with potential impact on tumor control and/or toxicity profile. Prospective ICRs are encouraged for future studies to prevent and correct protocol violations before start of treatment."
"The generation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived ventricular progenitors and their assembly into a 3-dimensional in vivo functional ventricular heart patch has remained an elusive goal. Herein, we report the generation of an enriched pool of hPSC-derived ventricular progenitors (HVPs), which can expand, differentiate, self-assemble, and mature into a functional ventricular patch in vivo without the aid of any gel or matrix. We documented a specific temporal window, in which the HVPs will engraft in vivo. On day 6 of differentiation, HVPs were enriched by depleting cells positive for pluripotency marker TRA-1-60 with magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS), and 3 million sorted cells were sub-capsularly transplanted onto kidneys of NSG mice where, after 2 months, they formed a 7 mm × 3 mm × 4 mm myocardial patch resembling the ventricular wall. The graft acquired several features of maturation: expression of ventricular marker (MLC2v), desmosomes, appearance of T-tubule-like structures, and electrophysiological action potential signature consistent with maturation, all this in a non-cardiac environment. We further demonstrated that HVPs transplanted into un-injured hearts of NSG mice remain viable for up to 8 months. Moreover, transplantation of 2 million HVPs largely preserved myocardial contractile function following myocardial infarction. Taken together, our study reaffirms the promising idea of using progenitor cells for regenerative therapy."
"The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are inherited lysosomal storage disorders characterized by general neurodegeneration and premature death. Sight loss is also a major symptom in NCLs, severely affecting the quality of life of patients, but it is not targeted effectively by brain-directed therapies. Here we set out to explore the therapeutic potential of an ocular gene therapy to treat sight loss in NCL due to a deficiency in the transmembrane protein CLN6. We found that, although Cln6nclfmice presented mainly with photoreceptor degeneration, supplementation of CLN6 in photoreceptors was not beneficial. Because the level of CLN6 is low in photoreceptors but high in bipolar cells (retinal interneurons that are only lost in Cln6-deficient mice at late disease stages), we explored the therapeutic effects of delivering CLN6 to bipolar cells using adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 7m8. Bipolar cell-specific expression of CLN6 slowed significantly the loss of photoreceptor function and photoreceptor cells. This study shows that the deficiency of a gene normally expressed in bipolar cells can cause the loss of photoreceptors and that this can be prevented by bipolar cell-directed treatment."
"Mitochondria play fundamental roles within cells, including energy provision, calcium homeostasis, and the regulation of apoptosis. The transport of mitochondria by microtubule-based motors is critical for neuronal structure and function. This process allows local requirements for mitochondrial functions to be met and also facilitates recycling of these organelles [1, 2]. An age-related reduction in mitochondrial transport has been observed in neurons of mammalian and non-mammalian organisms [3-6], and has been proposed to contribute to the broader decline in neuronal function that occurs during aging [3, 5-7]. However, the factors that influence mitochondrial transport in aging neurons are poorly understood. Here we provide evidence using the tractable Drosophila wing nerve system that the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) pathway promotes the axonal transport of mitochondria in adult neurons. The level of the catalytic subunit of PKA decreases during aging, and acute activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway in aged flies strongly stimulates mitochondrial motility. Thus, the age-related impairment of transport is reversible. The expression of many genes is increased by PKA activation in aged flies. However, our results indicate that elevated mitochondrial transport is due in part to upregulation of the heavy chain of the kinesin-1 motor, the level of which declines during aging. Our study identifies evolutionarily conserved factors that can strongly influence mitochondrial motility in aging neurons."
"Crossing over between homologous chromosomes during meiosis repairs programmed DNA double-strand breaks, ensures proper segregation at meiosis I [1], shapes the genomic distribution of nucleotide variability in populations, and enhances the efficacy of natural selection among genetically linked sites [2]. Between closely related Drosophila species, large differences exist in the rate and chromosomal distribution of crossing over. Little, however, is known about the molecular genetic changes or population genetic forces that mediate evolved differences in recombination between species [3, 4]. Here, we show that a meiosis gene with a history of rapid evolution acts as a trans-acting modifier of species differences in crossing over. In transgenic flies, the dicistronic gene, mei-217/mei-218, recapitulates a large part of the species differences in the rate and chromosomal distribution of crossing over. These phenotypic differences appear to result from changes in protein sequence not gene expression. Our population genetics analyses show that the protein-coding sequence of mei-218, but not mei-217, has a history of recurrent positive natural selection. By modulating the intensity of centromeric and telomeric suppression of crossing over, evolution at mei-217/-218 has incidentally shaped gross differences in the chromosomal distribution of nucleotide variability between species. We speculate that recurrent bouts of adaptive evolution at mei-217/-218 might reflect a history of coevolution with selfish genetic elements."
"Starburst amacrine cell (SAC) morphology is considered central to retinal direction selectivity. In Sema6A-/-mice, SAC dendritic arbors are smaller and no longer radially symmetric, leading to a reduction in SAC dendritic plexus density. Sema6A-/-mice also have a dramatic reduction in the directional tuning of retinal direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). Here we show that the loss of DSGC tuning in Sema6A-/-mice is due to reduced null direction inhibition, even though strong asymmetric SAC-DSGC connectivity and SAC dendritic direction selectivity are maintained. Hence, the reduced coverage factor of SAC dendrites leads specifically to a loss of null direction inhibition. Moreover, SAC dendrites are no longer strictly tuned to centrifugal motion, indicating that SAC morphology is critical in coordinating synaptic connectivity and dendritic integration to generate direction selectivity."
"Approach-avoidance conflict arises when an animal encounters a stimulus that is associated simultaneously with positive and negative valences [1]. The effective resolution of approach-avoidance conflict is critical for survival and is believed to go awry in a number of mental disorders, such as anxiety and addiction. An accumulation of evidence from both rodents and humans suggests that the ventral hippocampus (anterior in humans) plays a key role in approach-avoidance conflict processing [2-8], with one influential model proposing that this structure modulates behavioral inhibition in the face of conflicting goals by increasing the influence of negative valences [9]. Very little is known, however, about the contributions of specific hippocampal subregions to this process-an important issue given the functional and anatomical heterogeneity of this structure. Using a non-spatial cue-based paradigm in rats, we found that transient pharmacological inactivation of ventral CA1 produced an avoidance of a conflict cue imbued with both learned positive and learned negative outcomes, whereas inactivation of the ventral CA3 resulted in the opposite pattern of behavior, with significant preference for the conflict cue. In contrast, dorsal CA1- and CA3-inactivated rats showed no change in conflict behavior, and furthermore, additional behavioral tasks confirmed that the observed pattern of approach-avoidance findings could not be explained by other factors, such as differential alterations in novelty detection or locomotor activity. Our data demonstrate that ventral CA1 and CA3 subserve distinct and opposing roles in approach-avoidance conflict processing and provide important insight into the functions and circuitry of the ventral hippocampus."
"Ensemble docking corresponds to the generation of an ""ensemble"" of drug target conformations in computational structure-based drug discovery, often obtained by using molecular dynamics simulation, that is used in docking candidate ligands. This approach is now well established in the field of early-stage drug discovery. This review gives a historical account of the development of ensemble docking and discusses some pertinent methodological advances in conformational sampling."
"The study aims to assess variability in leaf water isotopic enrichment occurring in the field under natural conditions. We focused on seasonal variation and difference between sun-exposed and shaded leaves. Isotopic composition (?18O, ?2H) of leaf water was monitored in a beach tree (Fagus sylvatica L.) growing in the forest-meadow ecotone together with ?18O (2H) of water compartments which are in close relation to this signal, namely twig and soil water. The sampling was carried out in approximately two-week intervals during five consecutive vegetation seasons. The ?18O (2H) data showed a distinct seasonal pattern and a consistency in relative differences between the seasons and sample categories. Leaf water was the most isotopically enriched water compartment. The leaf water enrichment decreased toward the autumn reflecting the change in ?18O (2H) of source water and evaporative demands. The soil and twig water isotopic signal was depleted against current precipitation as it partly retained the isotopic signature from winter precipitation however the seasonal pattern of soil and twig water followed that of precipitation. No significant differences between sun-exposed and shaded samples were detected. Nevertheless, the observed strong seasonal pattern of isotope composition of leaf, twig and soil water should be taken into account when using leaf water enrichment for further calculations or modeling."
"Fetal hemoglobin (HbF, ?2?2) level is genetically controlled and modifies severity of adult hemoglobin (HbA, ?2?2) disorders, sickle cell disease, and ?-thalassemia. Common genetic variation affects expression of BCL11A, a regulator of HbF silencing. To uncover how BCL11A supports the developmental switch from ?- to ?- globin, we use a functional assay and protein binding microarray to establish a requirement for a zinc-finger cluster in BCL11A in repression and identify a preferred DNA recognition sequence. This motif appears in embryonic and fetal-expressed globin promoters and is duplicated in ?-globin promoters. The more distal of the duplicated motifs is mutated in individuals with hereditary persistence of HbF. Using the CUT&RUN approach to map protein binding sites in erythroid cells, we demonstrate BCL11A occupancy preferentially at the distal motif, which can be disrupted by editing the promoter. Our findings reveal that direct ?-globin gene promoter repression by BCL11A underlies hemoglobin switching."
"Coexpression of proteins in response to pathway-inducing signals is the founding paradigm of gene regulation. However, it remains unexplored whether the relative abundance of co-regulated proteins requires precise tuning. Here, we present large-scale analyses of protein stoichiometry and corresponding regulatory strategies for 21 pathways and 67-224 operons in divergent bacteria separated by 0.6-2 billion years. Using end-enriched RNA-sequencing (Rend-seq) with single-nucleotide resolution, we found that many bacterial gene clusters encoding conserved pathways have undergone massive divergence in transcript abundance and architectures via remodeling of internal promoters and terminators. Remarkably, these evolutionary changes are compensated post-transcriptionally to maintain preferred stoichiometry of protein synthesis rates. Even more strikingly, in eukaryotic budding yeast, functionally analogous proteins that arose independently from bacterial counterparts also evolved to convergent in-pathway expression. The broad requirement for exact protein stoichiometries despite regulatory divergence provides an unexpected principle for building biological pathways both in nature and for synthetic activities."
"Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by preferential loss of the medium spiny neurons in the striatum. Using CRISPR/Cas9 and somatic nuclear transfer technology, we established a knockin (KI) pig model of HD that endogenously expresses full-length mutant huntingtin (HTT). By breeding this HD pig model, we have successfully obtained F1 and F2 generation KI pigs. Characterization of founder and F1 KI pigs shows consistent movement, behavioral abnormalities, and early death, which are germline transmittable. More importantly, brains of HD KI pig display striking and selective degeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons. Thus, using a large animal model of HD, we demonstrate for the first time that overt and selective neurodegeneration seen in HD patients can be recapitulated by endogenously expressed mutant proteins in large mammals, a finding that also underscores the importance of using large mammals to investigate the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and their therapeutics."
"Genetic linkage analysis previously suggested that GKAP, a scaffold protein of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), was a potential modifier of invasion in a mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PanNET). Here, we establish that GKAP governs invasive growth and treatment response to NMDAR inhibitors of PanNET via its pivotal role in regulating NMDAR pathway activity. Combining genetic knockdown of GKAP and pharmacological inhibition of NMDAR, we implicate as downstream effectors FMRP and HSF1, which along with GKAP demonstrably support invasiveness of PanNET and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer cells. Furthermore, we distilled genome-wide expression profiles orchestrated by the NMDAR-GKAP signaling axis, identifying transcriptome signatures in tumors with low/inhibited NMDAR activity that significantly associate with favorable patient prognosis in several cancer types."
"Human stem cell-based models of thermogenic adipocytes provide an opportunity for the establishment of new therapeutics, modeling of disease mechanisms, and understanding of development. Pluripotent stem cells, adipose-derived stem cells/preadipocytes, and programming-reprogramming-based approaches have been used to develop cell-based platforms for drug screening and transplantable therapeutics in the metabolic disease arena. Here we provide a detailed overview of these approaches, the latest advances in this field, and the opportunities and shortcomings they present. Moreover, we comment on how stem-cell-based platforms can be best utilized in the future for the treatment and understanding of metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and associated medical issues such as obesity."
"Obese insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus profoundly impair bone mechanical properties and bone quality. However, because several antidiabetes drugs, especially thiazolidinediones, further aggravate bone loss in individuals with diabetes, diabetic osteopathy should not be treated by using simply any glucose-lowering agents. Recently, incretins have been reported to affect osteoblast function positively. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of vildagliptin, an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4, on bone of rats with high-fat-diet-induced prediabetes.Male rats were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks to induce obese insulin resistance and then treated with vildagliptin for 4 weeks. The effects of the drug on bone were determined by microcomputed tomography and bone histomorphometry.Vildagliptin markedly improved insulin resistance in these obese insulin-resistant rats. It also significantly increased volumetric bone mineral density. Specifically, vildagliptin-treated obese insulin-resistant rats exhibited higher trabecular volumetric bone mineral density than vehicle-treated obese insulin-resistant rats, whereas cortical volumetric bone mineral density, cortical thickness and area were not changed. Bone histomorphometric analysis in a trabecular-rich area (i.e. tibial metaphysis) revealed greater trabecular bone volume and number and less trabecular separation without change in trabecular thickness, osteocyte lacunar area or cortical thickness in the vildagliptin-treated group.Vildagliptin had a beneficial effect on the bone of obese insulin-resistant rats with prediabetes, particularly at the trabecular site. Such benefit probably results from enhanced bone formation rather than from suppressed bone resorption."
"Resistance to chemotherapy and pathway-targeted therapies poses a major problem in cancer research. While the fields of tumor biology and experimental therapeutics have already benefited from ex vivo preclinical tissue models, these models have yet to address the reasons for malignant transformations and the emergence of chemoresistance. With the increasing number of ex vivo models poised to incorporate physiological biophysical properties, along with the advent of genomic sequencing information, there are now unprecedented opportunities to better understand tumorigenesis and to design therapeutic approaches to overcome resistance. Here we discuss that new preclinical ex vivo models should consider - in addition to common biophysical parameters such as matrix stiffness and bioadhesivity - a more comprehensive milieu of tissue signaling, nuclear mechanics, immune response, and the gut microbiome."
"Intratumoral heterogeneity is among the greatest challenges in precision cancer therapy. However, developments in high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) may now provide the statistical power to dissect the diverse cellular populations of tumors. In the future these technologies might inform the selection of targeted combination therapies and enrollment criteria for clinical trials."
"To address cancer as a multifaceted adaptive system, the increasing momentum for cross-disciplinary connectivity between cancer biologists, physical scientists, mathematicians, chemists, biomedical engineers, computer scientists, clinicians, and advocates is fueling the emergence of new scientific frontiers, principles, and opportunities within physical sciences and oncology. In parallel to highlighting the advances, challenges, and acceptance of advocates as credible contributors, we offer recommendations for addressing real world hurdles in advancing equitable partnerships among advocacy stakeholders."
"Most phenome-wide association studies (PheWASs) to date have used a small to moderate number of SNPs for association with phenotypic data. We performed a large-scale single-cohort PheWAS, using electronic health record (EHR)-derived case-control status for 541 diagnoses using International Classification of Disease version 9 (ICD-9) codes and 25 median clinical laboratory measures. We calculated associations between these diagnoses and traits with ?630,000 common frequency SNPs with minor allele frequency > 0.01 for 38,662 individuals. In this landscape PheWAS, we explored results within diseases and traits, comparing results to those previously reported in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), as well as previously published PheWASs. We further leveraged the context of functional impact from protein-coding to regulatory regions, providing a deeper interpretation of these associations. The comprehensive nature of this PheWAS allows for novel hypothesis generation, the identification of phenotypes for further study for future phenotypic algorithm development, and identification of cross-phenotype associations."
"The multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) phenotype is among the most severe forms of sperm defects responsible for male infertility. The phenotype is characterized by the presence in the ejaculate of immotile spermatozoa with severe flagellar abnormalities including flagella being short, coiled, absent, and of irregular caliber. Recent studies have demonstrated that MMAF is genetically heterogeneous, and genes thus far associated with MMAF account for only one-third of cases. Here we report the identification of homozygous truncating mutations (one stop-gain and one splicing variant) in CFAP69 of two unrelated individuals by whole-exome sequencing of a cohort of 78 infertile men with MMAF. CFAP69 encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein found at high levels in the testis. Immunostaining experiments in sperm from fertile control individuals showed that CFAP69 localized to the midpiece of the flagellum, and the absence of CFAP69 was confirmed in both individuals carrying CFPA69 mutations. Additionally, we found that sperm from a Cfap69 knockout mouse model recapitulated the MMAF phenotype. Ultrastructural analysis of testicular sperm from the knockout mice showed severe disruption of flagellum structure, but histological analysis of testes from these mice revealed the presence of all stages of the seminiferous epithelium, indicating that the overall progression of spermatogenesis is preserved and that the sperm defects likely arise during spermiogenesis. Together, our data indicate that CFAP69 is necessary for flagellum assembly/stability and that in both humans and mice, biallelic truncating mutations in CFAP69 cause autosomal-recessive MMAF and primary male infertility."
"What drives the formation of chromatin loops has been a long-standing question in chromosome biology. Recent work provides major insight into the basic principles behind loop formation. Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes, that are conserved from bacteria to humans, are key to this process. The SMC family includes condensin and cohesin, which structure chromosomes to enable mitosis and long-range gene regulation. We discuss novel insights into the mechanism of loop formation and the implications for how these complexes ultimately shape chromosomes. A picture is emerging in which these complexes form small loops that they then processively enlarge. It appears that SMC complexes act by family-wide basic principles, with complex-specific levels of control."
"This was a national English observational cohort study to estimate the effectiveness of inpatient withdrawal (IW) and residential rehabilitation (RR) interventions for alcohol use disorder (AUD) using administrative data.All adults commencing IW and/or RR intervention for AUD between April 1, 2014 and March 31, 2015 reported to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (n=3812). The primary outcome was successful completion of treatment within 12months of commencement, with no re-presentation (SCNR) in the subsequent six months, analysed by multi-level, mixed effects, multivariable logistic regression.The majority (70%, n=2682) received IW in their index treatment journey; one-quarter (24%, n=915) received RR; 6% (n=215) received both. Of treatment leavers, 59% achieved the SCNR outcome (IW: 57%; RR: 64%; IW/RR: 57%). Positive outcome for IW was associated with older age, being employed, and receiving community-based treatment prior to and subsequent to IW. Patients with housing problems were less likely to achieving the outcome. Positive outcome for RR was associated with paid employment, self/family/peer referral, longer duration of RR treatment, and community-based treatment following discharge. Community-based treatment prior to entering RR, and receiving IW during the same treatment journey as RR, were associated with lower likelihood of SCNR.In this first national effectiveness study of AUD in the English public treatment system for alcohol-use disorders, 59% of patients successfully completed treatment within 12months and did not represent for more treatment within six months. Longer duration of treatment and provision of structured continuing care is associated with better treatment outcomes."
"In due course of evolution many pathogens alter their effector molecules to modulate the host plants' metabolism and immune responses triggered upon proper recognition by the intracellular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins. Likewise, host plants have also evolved with diversified NLR proteins as a survival strategy to win the battle against pathogen invasion. NLR protein indeed detects pathogen derived effector proteins leading to the activation of defense responses associated with programmed cell death (PCD). In this interactive process, genome structure and plasticity play pivotal role in the development of innate immunity. Despite being quite conserved with similar biological functions in all eukaryotes, the intracellular NLR immune receptor proteins happen to be structurally distinct. Recent studies have made progress in identifying transcriptional regulatory complexes activated by NLR proteins. In this review, we attempt to decipher the intracellular NLR proteins mediated surveillance across the evolutionarily diverse taxa, highlighting some of the recent updates on NLR protein compartmentalization, molecular interactions before and after activation along with insights into the finer role of these receptor proteins to combat invading pathogens upon their recognition. Latest information on NLR sensors, helpers and NLR proteins with integrated domains in the context of plant pathogen interactions are also discussed."
"Lobed leaf is a common trait, which is related with photosynthesis and plant stress resistance in crops. In order to fine map and isolate the lobed-leaf gene in Brassica napus, an F2:3population derived from 2205 (salt tolerance) and 1423 (salt sensitive) was constructed, and the quantitative trait locus (QTL) technology was adopted to identify the QTLs related to lobed leaf formation. As a result, one major QTL was identified on LG10, and two intron polymorphic (IP) markers and one sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker were successfully developed in QTL region. The lobed-leaf gene was mapped to a region from 15.701 to 15.817?M on A10. In light of annotations of the genes in candidate region, a leaf morphological development related gene, Bra009510, was primary identified as the candidate gene. The full length of the candidate gene was 1390?bp containing three exons and two introns in the two parents. The open reading frame (ORF) was 693?bp and encoded a protein of 229 amino acids. Eight amino acid differences between the two parents in CDS (coding sequences) region were identified. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of the candidate gene was significantly different between the two parents under salt stress. These results showed that the candidate gene might be related to leaf morphological development and abiotic stresses. Our study will lay a solid foundation for studying lobed leaf mechanism in B. napus L."
"The root growth of most crop plants is inhibited by soil salinity. Roots respond by modulating metabolism, gene expression and protein activity, which results in changes in cell wall composition, transport processes, cell size and shape, and root architecture. Here, we focus on the effects of salt stress on cell wall modifying enzymes, cellulose microfibril orientation and non-cellulosic polysaccharide deposition in root elongation zones, as important determinants of inhibition of root elongation, and highlight cell wall changes linked to tolerance to salt stressed and water limited roots. Salt stress induces changes in the wall composition of specific root cell types, including the increased deposition of lignin and suberin in endodermal and exodermal cells. These changes can benefit the plant by preventing water loss and altering ion transport pathways. We suggest that binding of Na+ions to cell wall components might influence the passage of Na+and that Na+can influence the binding of other ions and hinder the function of pectin during cell growth. Naturally occurring differences in cell wall structure may provide new resources for breeding crops that are more salt tolerant."
"Hop is an important source of medicinally valuable secondary metabolites including bioactive prenylated chalcones. To gain in-depth knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms of hop flavonoids biosynthesis, full-length cDNA of HlMyb8 transcription factor gene was isolated from lupulin glands. The deduced amino acid sequence of HlMyb8 showed high similarity to a flavonol-specific regulator of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis AtMYB12 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Transient expression studies and qRT-PCR analysis of transgenic hop plants overexpressing HlMyb8 revealed that HlMYB8 activates expression of chalcone synthase HlCHS_H1 as well as other structural genes from the flavonoid pathway branch leading to the production of flavonols (F3H, F'3H, FLS) but not prenylflavonoids (PT1, OMT1) or bitter acids (VPS, PT1). HlMyb8 could cross-activate Arabidopsis flavonol-specific genes but to a much lesser extent than AtMyb12. Reciprocally, AtMyb12 could cross-activate hop flavonol-specific genes. Transcriptome sequence analysis of hop leaf tissue overexpressing HlMyb8 confirmed the modulation of several other genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis pathways (PAL, 4CL, ANR, DFR, LDOX). Analysis of metabolites in hop female cones confirmed that overexpression of HlMyb8 does not increase prenylflavonoid or bitter acids content in lupulin glands. It follows from our results that HlMYB8 plays role in a competition between flavonol and prenylflavonoid or bitter acid pathways by diverting the flux of CHS_H1 gene product and thus, may influence the level of these metabolites in hop lupulin."
"Seedlessness in grapes is a desirable trait, especially for in natura consumption. Previously, we showed that VviAGL11 is the main responsible gene for seed morphogenesis in grapevine. Here we tested the function of this gene in grapevine with the use of plant plasmids. VviAGL11 was cloned into silencing and overexpression versions of p28iIR plasmid. Reproductive grapevine bunches from different seeded and seedless cultivars were separately treated with VviAGL11-harboring plasmids, along with controls. Plasmids were detected in leaves after a month of treatment, and berries, leaves, stems and seeds were analyzed for ectopic gene expression by RT-qPCR after 90?days of plasmid injection. Fruits from the seedless 'Linda' treated with the VviAGL11-overexpression plasmid showed high expression levels of VviAGL11 and exhibited small seeds that were not found in the untreated control samples. Mature grapes from seeded 'Italia' and 'Ruby' bunches treated with the VviAGL11-silencing plasmid showed decreased VviAGL11 expression, reduced number of seeds and increased number of seed traces. The present study confirms that VviAGL11 is a key master regulator of seed morphogenesis in grapevine and corroborates with the applicability of plant plasmids as promising biotechnological tools to functionally test genes in perennial plants in a rapid and confident way."
"Programmed cell death (PCD) and autophagy are both important means for plants to resist pathogen. It is also the main biological reaction of plant immunity. In previous studies, we found that TMV local-infection on tomato leaves not only caused the PCD process in the distal root tissues, but also induced autophagy in root-tip cells. However, the reasons for these biological phenomena are unclear. In order to get deeper insight, the role of a putative inducible factor reactive oxidative species (ROS) was investigated. The situ staining and subcellular localization analysis showed that the ROS level in the root tissue of TMV infected plants was significantly promoted. TEM observation showed that the intracellular ROS was excreted into the cell wall and intercellular layer. At the same time, the results of western blot and qRT-PCR showed that the expression of autophagy related protein Atg8 and genes (Atg5, Atg7 and Atg10) were increased. However, in the subsequent DPI inhibition experiments we found that the accumulation of ROS in infected plant root-tip tissues was inhibited and the autophagy in the root-tip cells also decreased. When 3-methyladenine (3-MA) was used to inhibit autophagy, there was no significant change in the ROS level in the apical tissue, while the systemic PCD process of the root-tip cells was elevated. Taken together, these results indicate that local TMV inoculation on the leaves induced the root-tip cells producing and releasing a lot of ROS into the extracellular matrix for defense against pathogen invasion. Meanwhile, ROS acted as a signaling substance and triggered autophagy in root-tip cells, in order to eliminate excessive intracellular ROS oxidative damage and maintain cell survival."
"We describe eleven hominin metacarpals and phalanges recovered from Jacovec Cavern and Member 4 of the Sterkfontein Formation between 1998 and 2003. Collectively, the fossils date in excess of 2.0 Ma, and are probably attributable to Australopithecus africanus and/or Australopithecus prometheus. When combined with results of previous studies on Australopithecus postcranial functional morphology, the new data presented here suggest that at least some late Pliocene and/or early Pleistocene hominins from Sterkfontein were arboreally adept. This finding accords with the reconstruction of the site's >2.0 Ma catchment area as well-vegetated and containing significant woody components. In addition, most of the new specimens described here evince morphologies that indicate the hands from which they derived lacked complete modern humanlike manual dexterity, which is integral to the manufacture and use of intentionally shaped stone tools. The absence of lithic artifacts from both stratigraphic units from which the fossils were excavated is consistent with this conclusion."
"Modern humans have smaller faces relative to Middle and Late Pleistocene members of the genus Homo. While facial reduction and differences in shape have been shown to increase biting efficiency in Homo sapiens relative to these hominins, facial size reduction has also been said to decrease our ability to resist masticatory loads. This study compares crania of Homo heidelbergensis and H. sapiens with respect to mechanical advantages of masticatory muscles, force production efficiency, strains experienced by the cranium and modes of deformation during simulated biting. Analyses utilize X-ray computed tomography (CT) scan-based 3D models of a recent modern human and two H. heidelbergensis. While having muscles of similar cross-sectional area to H. heidelbergensis, our results confirm that the modern human masticatory system is more efficient at converting muscle forces into bite forces. Thus, it can produce higher bite forces than Broken Hill for equal muscle input forces. This difference is the result of alterations in relative in and out-lever arm lengths associated with well-known differences in midfacial prognathism. Apparently at odds with this increased efficiency is the finding that the modern human cranium deforms more, resulting in greater strain magnitudes than Broken Hill when biting at the equivalent tooth. Hence, the facial reduction that characterizes modern humans may not have evolved as a result of selection for force production efficiency. These findings provide further evidence for a degree of uncoupling between form and function in the masticatory system of modern humans. This may reflect the impact of food preparation technologies. These data also support previous suggestions that differences in bite force production efficiency can be considered a spandrel, primarily driven by the midfacial reduction in H. sapiens that occurred for other reasons. Midfacial reduction plausibly resulted in a number of other significant changes in morphology, such as the development of a chin, which has itself been the subject of debate as to whether or not it represents a mechanical adaptation or a spandrel."
"Detailed analyses and comparisons of postcranial specimens of Plio-Pleistocene cercopithecids provide an opportunity to examine the recent evolutionary history and locomotor diversity in Old World monkeys. Studies examining the positional behavior and substrate preferences of fossil cercopithecids are also important for reconstructing the paleoenvironments of Plio-Pleistocene hominin sites. Here we describe a new fossil cercopithecid tibia (EP 1100/12) from the Australopithecus afarensis-bearing Upper Laetolil Beds (?3.7 Ma) of Laetoli in northern Tanzania. The fossil tibia is attributed to cf. Rhinocolobus sp., which is the most common colobine at Laetoli. In addition to qualitative comparisons, the tibial shape of EP 1100/12 was compared to that of 190 extant cercopithecids using three-dimensional landmarks. Discriminant function analyses of the shape data were used to assess taxonomic affinity and shape variation relating to positional behavior. EP 1100/12 clustered with extant colobines, particularly the large-bodied genera Nasalis and Rhinopithecus. Comparisons reveal that EP 1100/12 belongs to a large-bodied monkey that engaged in arboreal pronograde quadrupedalism. These findings add further support to previous inferences that woodland and forest environments dominated the paleoenvironment of the Upper Laetolil Beds, which supported the diverse community of cercopithecids at Laetoli. The inferred paleoecology and the presence of large-bodied arboreally-adapted monkeys at Laetoli show that A. afarensis had access to a range of diverse habitats, including woodlands and forests. This supports the possibility that A. afarensis, with its potential range of positional capabilities, was able to utilize arboreal settings for food acquisition and refuge from predators."
"Acinetobacter baumannii (A. Baumannii) is an emerging opportunistic pathogen responsible for hospital-acquired infections, and which now constitutes a sufficiently serious threat to public health to necessitate the development of an effective vaccine. In this study, a recombinant fused protein named OmpK/Omp22 and two individual proteins OmpK and Omp22 were obtained using recombinant expression and Ni-affinity purification. Groups of BALB/c mice were immunized with these proteins and challenged with a clinically isolated strain of A. baumannii. The bacterial load in the blood, pathological changes in the lung tissue and survival rates after challenge were evaluated. Mice immunized with OmpK/Omp22 fused protein provided significantly greater protection against A. baumannii challenge than those immunized with either of the two proteins individually. The results provide novel clues for future design of vaccines against A. baumannii."
"Newly identified human rhinovirus C (HRV-C) and human bocavirus (HBoV) cannot propagate in vitro in traditional cell culture models; thus obtaining knowledge about these viruses and developing related vaccines are difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel platform for the propagation of these types of viruses.A platform for culturing human airway epithelia in a three-dimensional (3D) pattern using Matrigel as scaffold was developed. The features of 3D culture were identified by immunochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy. Nucleic acid levels of HRV-C and HBoV in 3D cells at designated time points were quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Levels of cytokines, whose secretion was induced by the viruses, were measured by ELISA.Properties of bronchial-like tissues, such as the expression of biomarkers CK5, ZO-1, and PCK, and the development of cilium-like protuberances indicative of the human respiration tract, were observed in 3D-cultured human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, but not in monolayer-cultured cells. Nucleic acid levels of HRV-C and HBoV and levels of virus-induced cytokines were also measured using the 3D culture system.Our data provide a preliminary indication that the 3D culture model of primary epithelia using a Matrigel scaffold in vitro can be used to propagate HRV-C and HBoV."
"To better understand the pathological causes of bone loss in a space environment, including microgravity, ionizing radiation, and ultradian rhythms.Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into a baseline group, a control group, a hindlimb suspension group, a radiation group, a ultradian rhythms group and a combined-three-factor group. After four weeks of hindlimb suspension followed by X-ray exposure and/or ultradian rhythms, biomechanical properties, bone mineral density, histological analysis, microstructure parameters, and bone turnover markers were detected to evaluate bone loss in hindlimbs of rats.Simulated microgravity or combined-three factors treatment led to a significant decrease in the biomechanical properties of bones, reduction in bone mineral density, and deterioration of trabecular parameters. Ionizing radiation exposure also showed adverse impact while ultradian rhythms had no significant effect on these outcomes. Decrease in the concentration of the turnover markers bone alkaline phosphatase (bALP), osteocalcin (OCN), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b (TRAP-5b) in serum was in line with the changes in trabecular parameters.Simulated microgravity is the main contributor of bone loss. Radiation also results in deleterious effects but ultradian rhythms has no significant effect. Combined-three factors treatment do not exacerbate bone loss when compared to simulated microgravity treatment alone."
"The welfare of threatened fauna should not be assumed merely because their refuges have been designated with protected status. This is particularly true in geographical areas where social/military events drive an under-reported, but potentially lethal, type of human-wildlife interaction. Waterbirds of Gharana Wetland Conservation Reserve consist mostly of threatened species. However, as occurs globally, 'protected' fauna near contested borders are sometimes affected by military forces. As part of a larger project to document regional avifauna, we report the seasonal status of waterbirds in order to help establish a baseline for comparing conservation of wildlife within contested areas to that of fauna in more secure refuges. We examined 24 avifauna surveys for relationships between seasons, temperature, individuals and species.28 of 61 waterbird species were rare. We found seasonal variations in individuals (F3,731?=?3.82; P?<?0.01) and species (F3,11?=?5.81; P?<?0.05) with a major influx in late winter, rather than autumn. Thus, while this sanctuary serves as an over-wintering site, it is also a stop-over site for high-altitude migrations. While providing this baseline, we offer a reminder that the welfare of wildlife in protected areas should be monitored seasonally, with the ongoing threats to their conservation, carefully documented."
"Recent progress in development of the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been shown to be an efficient gene-editing technology in various organisms. We recently developed a novel method called Genome-editing via Oviductal Nucleic Acids Delivery (GONAD) in mice; a novel in vivo genome editing system that does not require ex vivo handling of embryos, and this technology is newly developed and renamed as ""improved GONAD"" (i-GONAD). However, this technology has been limited only to mice. Therefore in this study, we challenge to apply this technology to rats.Here, we determine the most suitable condition for in vivo gene delivery towards rat preimplantation embryos using tetramethylrhodamine-labelled dextran, termed as Rat improved GONAD (rGONAD). Then, to investigate whether this method is feasible to generate genome-edited rats by delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 components, the tyrosinase (Tyr) gene was used as a target. Some pups showed albino-colored coat, indicating disruption of wild-type Tyr gene allele. Furthermore, we confirm that rGONAD method can be used to introduce genetic changes in rat genome by the ssODN-based knock-in.We first establish the rGONAD method for generating genome-edited rats. We demonstrate high efficiency of the rGONAD method to produce knock-out and knock-in rats, which will facilitate the production of rat genome engineering experiment. The rGONAD method can also be readily applicable in mammals such as guinea pig, hamster, cow, pig, and other mammals."
"Mounting evidence suggests that one of the ways that cells adapt to hypoxia is through alternative splicing. The aim of this study was firstly to examine the effect of hypoxia on the alternative splicing of cancer associated genes using the prostate cancer cell line PC3 as a model. Secondly, the effect of hypoxia on the expression of several regulators of splicing was examined.PC3 cells were grown in 1% oxygen in a hypoxic chamber for 48 h, RNA extracted and sent for high throughput PCR analysis at the RNomics platform at the University of Sherbrooke, Canada. Genes whose exon inclusion rate PSI (?) changed significantly were identified, and their altered exon inclusion rates verified by RT-PCR in three cell lines. The expression of splice factors and splice factor kinases in response to hypoxia was examined by qPCR and western blotting. The splice factor kinase CLK1 was inhibited with the benzothiazole TG003.In PC3 cells the exon inclusion rate PSI (?) was seen to change by >?25% in 12 cancer-associated genes; MBP, APAF1, PUF60, SYNE2, CDC42BPA, FGFR10P, BTN2A2, UTRN, RAP1GDS1, PTPN13, TTC23 and CASP9 (caspase 9). The expression of the splice factors SRSF1, SRSF2, SRSF3, SAM68, HuR, hnRNPA1, and of the splice factor kinases SRPK1 and CLK1 increased significantly in hypoxia. We also observed that the splice factor kinase CLK3, but not CLK2 and CLK4, was also induced in hypoxic DU145 prostate, HT29 colon and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. Lastly, we show that the inhibition of CLK1 in PC3 cells with the benzothiazole TG003 increased expression of the anti-apoptotic isoform caspase 9b.Significant changes in alternative splicing of cancer associated genes occur in prostate cancer cells in hypoxic conditions. The expression of several splice factors and splice factor kinases increases during hypoxia, in particular the Cdc-like splice factor kinases CLK1 and CLK3. We suggest that in hypoxia the elevated expression of these regulators of splicing helps cells adapt through alternative splicing of key cancer-associated genes. We suggest that the CLK splice factor kinases could be targeted in cancers in which hypoxia contributes to resistance to therapy."
"Trypanosoma brucei brucei, the parasite causing Nagana in domestic animals, is closely related to the parasites causing sleeping sickness, but does not infect humans. In addition to its importance as a pathogen, the relative ease of genetic manipulation and an innate capacity for RNAi extend its use as a model organism in cell and infection biology. During its development in its mammalian and insect (tsetse fly) hosts, T. b. brucei passes through several different life-cycle stages. There are currently four life-cycle stages that can be cultured: slender forms and stumpy forms, which are equivalent to forms found in the mammal, and early and late procyclic forms, which are equivalent to forms in the tsetse midgut. Early procyclic forms show coordinated group movement (social motility) on semi-solid surfaces, whereas late procyclic forms do not.RNA-Seq was performed on biological replicates of each life-cycle stage. These constitute the first datasets for culture-derived slender and stumpy bloodstream forms and early and late procyclic forms. Expression profiles confirmed that genes known to be stage-regulated in the animal and insect hosts were also regulated in culture. Sequence reads of 100-125 bases provided sufficient precision to uncover differential expression of closely related genes. More than 100 transcripts showed peak expression in stumpy forms, including adenylate cyclases and several components of inositol metabolism. Early and late procyclic forms showed differential expression of 73 transcripts, a number of which encoded proteins that were previously shown to be stage-regulated. Moreover, two adenylate cyclases previously shown to reduce social motility are up-regulated in late procyclic forms.This study validates the use of cultured bloodstream forms as alternatives to animal-derived parasites and yields new markers for all four stages. In addition to underpinning recent findings that early and late procyclic forms are distinct life-cycle stages, it could provide insights into the reasons for their different biological properties."
"KdsB (3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase) is a highly specific and selective bacterial enzyme that catalyzes KDO (3-Deoxy-D-mano-oct-2-ulosonic acid) activation in KDO biosynthesis pathway. Failure in KDO biosynthesis causes accumulation of lipid A in the bacterial outer membrane that leads to cell growth arrest. This study reports a combinatorial approach comprising virtual screening of natural drugs library, molecular docking, computational pharmacokinetics, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy calculations for the identification of potent lead compounds against the said enzyme. Virtual screening demonstrated 1460 druglike compounds in a total of 4800, while molecular docking illustrated Ser13, Arg14, and Asp236 as the anchor amino acids for recognizing and binding the inhibitors. Functional details of the enzyme in complex with the best characterized compound-226 were explored through two hundred nanoseconds of MD simulation. The ligand after initial adjustments jumps into the active cavity, followed by the deep cavity, and ultimately backward rotating movement towards the initial docked site of the pocket. During the entire simulation period, Asp236 remained in contact with the ligand and can be considered as a major catalytic residue of the enzyme. Radial distribution function confirmed that towards the end of the simulation, strengthening of ligand-receptor occurred with ligand and enzyme active residues in close proximity. Binding free energy calculations via MM(PB/GB)SA and Waterswap reaction coordinates, demonstrated the high affinity of the compound for enzyme active site residues. These findings can provide new avenues for designing potent compounds against notorious bacterial pathogens."
"The epochal developments in the treatment of meningioma-microsurgery, skull base techniques, and radiation therapy-will be appended to include the rational application of targeted and immune therapeutics, previously ill-fitting concepts for a tumor that has traditionally been a regarded as a surgical disease. The genomic and immunological architecture of these tumors continues to be defined in ever-greater detail. Grade I meningiomas are driven by NF2 alterations or mutations in AKT1, SMO, TRAF7, PIK3CA, KLF4, POLR2A, SUFU, and SMARCB1. Higher-grade tumors, however, are driven nearly exclusively by NF2/chr22 loss and are marked by infrequent targetable mutations, although they may harbor a greater mutation burden overall. TERT mutations may be more common in tumors that progress in histological grade; SMARCE1 alteration has become a signature of the clear cell subtype; and BAP1 in rhabdoid variants may confer sensitivity to pharmacological inhibition. Compared with grade I meningiomas, the most prominent alteration in grade II and III meningiomas is a significant increase in chromosomal gains and losses, or copy number alterations, which may have behavioral implications. Furthermore, integrated genomic analyses suggest phenotypic subgrouping by methylation profile and a specific role for PRC2 complex activation. Lastly, there exists a complex phylogenetic relationship among recurrent high-grade tumors, which continues to underscore a role for the most traditional therapy in our arsenal: surgery."
"Combination therapies of cisplatin with 5-FU (PF) are an effective solution and have been widely used for the treatment of various categories of cancer. including anal, gastrointestinal and oral cancer, as well as head and neck tumours. The effects of combined PF treatment on vital intracellular signalling pathways in nontargeted cells remain unclear. The aim of this study is to explain the possible mechanisms by which combined PF treatment results in retinal toxicity and to investigate the effects of PF on important vital signalling pathways in ARPE 19 retinal pigmented epithelial cells.We analysed the cellular and molecular effects of PF on cell viability, oxidative stress, gene repair response and induction of apoptosis in ARPE 19 cells using molecular probe fluorescent staining, cell cytometer, RAPD, qRT-PCR and western blot assays.We determined that PF causes excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and prevents ROS scavenging by suppressing antioxidant systems. We found induction of DNA damage, particularly mismatch and double strand break repair, in ARPE 19 cells treated with PF. In this study, PF also induced both the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and death receptor signalling in ARPE 19 cells.Our data proved that PF causes cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, at both the cellular and molecular levels, in ARPE 19 cells following particularly prolonged treatment (48?h). Additionally, our results suggest key molecular signals for prevention strategies that can be developed to reduce the severe side effects of PF chemotherapy."
"Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with birth outcomes, including birthweight. Exposure to natural disasters during pregnancy provides a model to study these relationships. However, few studies assess both stress and diet, which might have interactive effects. Furthermore, most are conducted in high-income countries. Patterns might differ in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).To study relationships between stress and diet during pregnancy, and infant birthweight, following a natural disaster in a lower-middle income country.In 2015, the island nation of Vanuatu suffered a Category 5 cyclone. Three months later, we assessed hardship due to the cyclone, distress, and dietary diversity among 900 women, including 187 pregnant women. Of these, 70 had birth records available. We used multivariate linear regression to analyse relationships between cyclone exposure and infant birthweight among this subsample.Neither hardship nor dietary diversity predicted birthweight. Distress was a robust predictor, explaining 8.5% of variance (p?=?0.012). There were no interactive relationships between distress and other exposure variables.Maternal distress following a natural disaster has important implications for maternal and child health. In LMICs, low birthweight remains a pressing public health concern. Distress during pregnancy might represent one underlying risk factor."
"Yin Yang1 (YY1) is a ubiquitous expressed transcription factor that modulates a variety of biologic processes with prominent roles in cellular differentiation and tissue development. Recent advances in molecular biology, mouse genetics, and particularly high-throughput sequencing have greatly enhanced our understanding of YY1 functions and underlying mechanisms in regulating transcription and epigenetics. In this review, we summarize findings on the roles of YY1 in cell differentiation and tissue development, in particular in muscle, nerve, and immune cells/tissues."
"Yin Yang 1 (YY1) belongs to the polycomb group (PcG) of proteins that modify chromatin epigenetically during dynamic regulation of their target genes. The predominant feature of YY1 is the zinc finger, an ancient structural motif that mediates protein-protein interactions and is capable of interacting with both DNA and RNA. Evidence reveals that YY1 acts predominantly as an epigenetic modulator, influencing the activity and/or localization of epigenetic modifiers molecules such as DNA methylation transferases, histone deacetylases, or non-coding RNAs. Deregulation of the epigenome is observed frequently in a variety of cancer types and is often correlated directly with advanced metastatic stages and poor prognosis. In this review, we address the current understanding of YY1 as a recruiter of epi-modifier molecules in the mechanism of aberrant regulation of target genes as a part of the metastatic cascade."
"The transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in several biological functions, including embryogenesis, differentiation, replication, and cellular proliferation. YY1 can both activate and repress transcription depending on its interactions with other transcription factors and co-factors. It affects the transcription of a large number of mammalian and viral genes. In this review, we focus on the role of YY1 in cancer biology, including its expression, function, regulation by other upstream factors, and some of its more significant downstream effectors. We also discuss its context-dependent and tumor-specific role in human cancer progression, roles as a prognostic marker, and how its interactions with other cancer-associated factors can be exploited to develop novel targeted therapies."
"Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a member of the GLI-Kruppel family of zinc finger proteins that plays vital roles in many biological processes, especially tumorigenesis. To date, ample evidence suggests a critical regulatory role of YY1 in tumor cell metastasis. The potential of YY1 as a valuable biomarker for cancer metastasis has been increasingly known. Here, we review the studies related to the expression, regulatory network, and clinical application of YY1 in cancer metastasis. We first summarize YY1 expression patterns in metastatic tumors. We then elaborate YY1-regulated mechanisms on five aspects, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration and invasion, stemness, polyploidy, and genomic stability. Finally, we discuss the correlation between YY1 expression and clinical outcomes and therapeutic potential of YY1 in cancer treatment. Based on this review, we conclude that YY1 is a bona fide inducer of cancer metastasis and can serve as a clinical biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer treatment."
"Lymphoma is characterized by heterogeneous biology, pathologic features, and clinical outcome. This has been proven by accumulating pathologic and molecular evidence attributed to underlying aberrant alterations at genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional, protein, microenvironmental levels, and dysregulated oncogenic signaling pathways. In the era of precision medicine, targeting oncogenic pathways to design drugs and to optimize treatment regimens for the lymphoma patients is feasible and clinically significant. As such, further understanding of the biology and the mechanisms behind lymphoma development and identification of oncogenic pathway activation and pathway-based biomarkers to better design precise therapies are challenging but hopeful. Furthermore, pathway-based targeted therapies in combination with traditional chemotherapy, single specific targeted antibody therapy, and immunotherapy might raise the hope for the patients with lymphoma, especially for relapsed and refractory lymphoma patients."
"Recent studies have definitively established that chromatin remodeling is a crucial epigenetic mechanism not only in physiological conditions but also in influencing cancer biology. It is a dynamic process in which the chromatin, the functional entity of DNA, can undergo specific modifications by obtaining transcriptional activation or transcriptional silencing. One of the most important recent discoveries in cancer genetics and genomics is that the genes involved in the establishment of chromatin structure, the so called chromatin remodelers, are frequently mutated in different types of human cancer. This review aims to summarize the main novelties related to this topic, describing also the contribution of such genes during oncogenesis. Particularly, we focus on the switch/sucrose non-fermentable complexes and on three of the most important chromatin remodeling genes in biliary and pancreatic cancer: ARID1A, PBRM1, and BAP1."
"Cancer biomarker discovery is a critical part of cancer prevention and treatment. Despite the decades of effort, only a small number of cancer biomarkers have been identified for and validated in clinical settings. Conceptual and methodological breakthroughs may help accelerate the discovery of additional cancer biomarkers, particularly their use for diagnostics. In this review, we have attempted to review the emerging concepts in cancer biomarker discovery, including real-world evidence, open access data, and data paucity in rare or uncommon cancers. We have also summarized the recent methodological progress in cancer biomarker discovery, such as high-throughput sequencing, liquid biopsy, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning and neural networks. Much attention has been given to the methodological details and comparison of the methodologies. Notably, these concepts and methodologies interact with each other and will likely lead to synergistic effects when carefully combined. Newer, more innovative concepts and methodologies are emerging as the current emerging ones became mainstream and widely applied to the field. Some future challenges are also discussed. This review contributes to the development of future theoretical frameworks and technologies in cancer biomarker discovery and will contribute to the discovery of more useful cancer biomarkers."
"The elucidation of the genetic basis of cancer is the result of the research conducted since the beginning of the previous century, which peaked during the decades of 1960s and 1970s. It has been achieved through two different but convergent routes: the first includes the study of oncogenic viruses in rodents and birds and the second includes the use of chemical carcinogens in cells or in animal model systems (mice). Within this framework, the identification of genes that present mutations, alterations in expression levels, and epigenetic modifications has been facilitated through the development of animal carcinogenesis models. One of these models is the well-characterized mouse multistage skin cancer system discussed in this review. In addition, recent evidence shows the great significance that cancer stem cells seem to have in the emergence and progression of carcinogenesis. Finally, herein we discuss the critical role that miRNAs have emerged to play in cancer progression. miRNAs emerged as molecules with an impact on most cancer-related cellular processes, involving cell proliferation, cell death (apoptosis), angiogenesis, migration/motility, and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. Their discovery has given rise to studies with a focus on miRNAs as key players in crucial oncogenesis-related processes and thus as potential targets in cancer therapeutics."
"Metastasis and drug resistance are two of the leading causes of death in cancer patients. Poor responses to antitumor drugs can lead to tumor cell dissemination and metastasis. On the other hand, cells that metastasize to lymph nodes and distant organs are liable to drug resistance. Recently, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been found to play a critical role in cancer metastasis and drug resistance; however, the underlying and intrinsic links between them remain unclear. In this review, we summarize recent advances in tumor metastasis and drug resistance, and we focus especially on the association between EMT, metastasis, and drug resistance. We discuss the molecular mechanisms and potential pathways involved in the regulation of EMT, focusing simultaneously on the roles of EMT in modulating metastasis and drug resistance, especially the nature of their intrinsic links across different types of cancer."
"It is widely recognized that a strong correlation exists between cancer and aberrant hemostasis. Patients with various types of cancers often develop thrombosis, a phenomenon commonly referred to as Trousseau syndrome. Tissue factor (TF) is expressed by tumor cells and contributes to a variety of pathologic processes, such as thrombosis, tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis, and metastasis. Tissue factor is expressed in two naturally occurring protein isoforms: membrane-bound full-length TF (flTF) and soluble alternatively spliced TF (asTF). Tissue factor is the primary initiator of blood coagulation, and it triggers intracellular signaling through protease-activated receptors (PARs). PARs are activated either by TF/FVIIa complexes or by thrombin generated following coagulation activation. Furthermore, the noncoagulant asTF retains an integrin-binding site and stimulates angiogenesis by ligating endothelial integrins ?v?3 and ?6?1. Lastly, the increased TF expression in tumors is associated with the release in blood of TF-positive procoagulant microparticles that favor thromboembolic complications. Therefore, the interruption of asTF and flTF signaling represents a potential antiangiogenic strategy. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of TF in cancer, and we explore therapeutic perspectives based on TF targeting."
"Homeobox (HOX) genes are a superfamily of highly conserved genes with essential functions in many aspects of mammalian development. Their expression is tightly regulated throughout the duration of definitive hematopoiesis, so the pathogenetic mechanism that leads to leukemia suggests that malignant transformation is directly intertwined with the deregulation of HOX gene expression. Even though HOX gene involvement has been reviewed extensively in adult leukemias, childhood leukemias have received much less attention and mainly in the context of leukemias harboring MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) gene translocations. In recent years, scientific evidence has highlighted HOX gene involvement in the development of other subtypes of childhood leukemias and added HOX gene family members that were previously unrelated to the pathogenesis of childhood leukemia. This has significant implications when considering both the risk stratification of pediatric patients and potential targets for successful therapy. Through the identification of HOX target genes, their resulting interactions, and the cognate signaling pathways, we hope to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the ectopic activation of these genes in childhood leukemias and subsequently to reveal new molecular targets for successful therapy in cases of poor prognosis or resistant disease."
"In 2010, Greater Manchester (GM) and London centralized acute stroke care services into a reduced number of hyperacute stroke units, with local stroke units providing on-going care nearer patients' homes.To explore the impact of centralized acute stroke care pathways on the experiences of patients.Qualitative interview study. Thematic analysis was undertaken, using deductive and inductive approaches. Final data analysis explored themes related to five chronological phases of the centralized stroke care pathway.Recruitment from 3 hospitals in GM (15 stroke patients/8 family members) and 4 in London (21 stroke patients/9 family members).Participants were impressed with emergency services and initial reception at hospital: disquiet about travelling further than a local hospital was allayed by clear explanations. Participants knew who was treating them and were involved in decisions. Difficulties for families visiting hospitals a distance from home were raised. Repatriation to local hospitals was not always timely, but no detrimental effects were reported. Discharge to the community was viewed less positively.Patients on the centralized acute stroke care pathways reported many positive aspects of care: the centralization of care pathways can offer patients a good experience. Disadvantages of travelling further were perceived to be outweighed by the opportunity to receive the best quality care. This study highlights the necessity for all staff on a centralized care pathway to provide clear and accessible information to patients, in order to maximize their experience of care."
"The rapid growth of the therapeutic protein market calls for more efficient purification methods. Various aggregating tags have recently emerged as simple, fast, cost-effective and column-free technologies for protein (and peptide) purification. In general, these column-free protein purification technologies involve the use of aggregating tags that induce the target protein into insoluble aggregates. These aggregates can be easily separated from soluble impurities and the target protein or peptide is then liberated by a cleavage process. This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art in using aggregating tags for protein purification. The methods are here categorized as follows: (1) tags that allow soluble expression of target protein in vivo and induce aggregation in vitro; (2) tags that induce soluble expression and self-assembling of target protein on insoluble biological polyester beads in vivo; (3) tags that induce formation of inactive aggregates in vivo; (4) tags that induce formation of active aggregates in vivo."
"To develop an efficient synthetic promoter library for fine-tuned expression of target genes in Corynebacterium glutamicum.A synthetic promoter library for C. glutamicum was developed based on conserved sequences of the -?10 and -?35 regions. The synthetic promoter library covered a wide range of strengths, ranging from 1 to 193% of the tac promoter. 68 promoters were selected and sequenced for correlation analysis between promoter sequence and strength with a statistical model. A new promoter library was further reconstructed with improved promoter strength and coverage based on the results of correlation analysis. Tandem promoter P70 was finally constructed with increased strength by 121% over the tac promoter. The promoter library developed in this study showed a great potential for applications in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology for the optimization of metabolic networks.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reconstruction of synthetic promoter library based on statistical analysis of C. glutamicum."
"To identify and characterize a novel bacterial pyranose 2-oxidase (P2Ox) and investigate its potential use in lignin degradation applications.A new bacterial P2Ox (PaP2Ox) enzyme was identified in the lignocellulolytic bacterium Pantoea ananatis Sd-1. The PaP2Ox open reading frame was cloned, and the encoded protein was heterologously expressed in an Escherichia coli expression system. Unlike another reported bacterial P2Ox enzyme, the purified PaP2Ox exhibits a homotetrameric spatial conformation that is similar to fungal P2Oxs, with each subunit having a molecular mass of 65 kDa. The recombinant PaP2Ox exhibits maximum activity at 50 °C and pH 6.5 with D-glucose as its preferred substrate. In addition, this enzyme was shown to work in combination with bacterial laccase in lignin degradation.The bacterial enzyme PaP2Ox has potential use in ligninolytic systems and shows promising value in industrial biotechnological applications."
"Heterogeneous and dynamic biomolecular complexes play a central role in many cellular processes but are poorly understood due to experimental challenges in characterizing their structural ensembles. To address these difficulties, we developed a hybrid methodology that combines X-ray crystallography with ensemble selections typically used in NMR studies to determine structural ensembles of heterogeneous biomolecular complexes. The method, termed READ, for residual electron and anomalous density, enables the visualization of heterogeneous conformational ensembles of complexes within crystals. Here we present a detailed protocol for performing the ensemble selections to construct READ ensembles. From a diverse pool of binding poses, a selection scheme is used to determine a subset of conformations that maximizes agreement with the X-ray data. Overall, READ is a general approach for obtaining a high-resolution view of dynamic protein-protein complexes."
"Determining high-resolution structures of proteins with helical symmetry can be challenging due to limitations in experimental data. In such instances, structure-based protein simulations driven by experimental data can provide a valuable approach for building models of helical assemblies. This chapter describes how the Rosetta macromolecular package can be used to model homomeric protein assemblies with helical symmetry in a range of modeling scenarios including energy refinement, symmetrical docking, comparative modeling, and de novo structure prediction. Data-guided structure modeling of helical assemblies with experimental information from electron density, X-ray fiber diffraction, solid-state NMR, and chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry is also described."
"The structural modeling of protein complexes by docking simulations has been attracting increasing interest with the rise of proteomics and of the number of experimentally identified binary interactions. Structures of unbound partners, either modeled or experimentally determined, can be used as input to sample as extensively as possible all putative binding modes and single out the most plausible ones. At the scoring step, evolutionary information contained in the joint multiple sequence alignments of both partners can provide key insights to recognize correct interfaces. Here, we describe a computational protocol based on the InterEvDock web server to exploit coevolution constraints in protein-protein docking methods. We provide methodology guidelines to prepare the input protein structures and generate improved alignments. We also explain how to extract and use the information returned by the server through the analysis of two representative examples."
"The atomic structures of protein complexes can provide useful information for drug design, protein engineering, systems biology, and understanding pathology. Obtaining this information experimentally can be challenging. However, if the structures of the subunits are known, then it is often possible to model the complex computationally. This chapter provide practical guidelines for docking proteins using the SwarmDock flexible protein-protein docking method, providing an overview of the factors that need to be considered when deciding whether docking is likely to be successful, the preparation of structural input, generation of docked poses, analysis and ranking of docked poses, and the validation of models using external data."
"Proteins fulfill versatile biological functions by interacting with each other and forming high-order complexes. Although the order in which protein subunits assemble is important for the biological function of their final complex, this kinetic information has received comparatively little attention in recent years. Here we describe a multiscale framework that can be used to simulate the kinetics of protein complex assembly. There are two levels of models in the framework. The structural details of a protein complex are reflected by the residue-based model, while a lower-resolution model uses a rigid-body (RB) representation to simulate the process of complex assembly. These two levels of models are integrated together, so that we are able to provide the kinetic information about complex assembly with both structural details and computational efficiency."
"Biology has amassed a wealth of information about the function of a multitude of protein-coding genes across species. The challenge now is to understand how all these proteins work together to form a living organism, and a crucial step for gaining this knowledge is a complete description of the molecular ""wiring circuits"" that underlie cellular processes. In this chapter, we describe a general computational framework for predicting multi-protein assemblies from biochemical co-fractionation data."
"The Complex Portal ( www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal ) is an encyclopedia of macromolecular complexes. Complexes are assigned unique, stable IDs, are species specific, and list all participating members with links to an appropriate reference database (UniProtKB, ChEBI, RNAcentral). Each complex is annotated extensively with its functions, properties, structure, stoichiometry, tissue expression profile, and subcellular location. Links to domain-specific databases allow the user to access additional information and enable data searching and filtering. Complexes can be saved and downloaded in PSI-MI XML, MI-JSON, and tab-delimited formats."
"A precise knowledge of the quaternary structure of proteins is essential to illuminate both their function and their evolution. The major part of our knowledge on quaternary structure is inferred from X-ray crystallography data, but this inference process is hard and error-prone. The difficulty lies in discriminating fortuitous protein contacts, which make up the lattice of protein crystals, from biological protein contacts that exist in the native cellular environment. Here, we review methods devised to discriminate between both types of contacts and describe resources for downloading protein quaternary structure information and identifying high-confidence quaternary structures. The use of high-confidence datasets of quaternary structures will be critical for the analysis of structural, functional, and evolutionary properties of proteins."
"The archaellum assembly machinery and its filament consist of seven proteins in the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. We have so far expressed, purified, and biochemically characterized four of these archaellum subunits, namely, FlaX, FlaH, FlaI, and FlaF. FlaX, FlaH, and FlaI tightly interact and form the archaellum motor complex important for archaellum assembly and rotation. We have previously shown that FlaH forms an inner ring within a very stable FlaX ring, and therefore FlaX is believed to provide the scaffold for the assembly of the archaellum motor complex. Here we describe how to express and purify FlaX and FlaH and how the double ring structure both form can be obtained."
"Bacterial surface appendages of the type 4 pilus superfamily play diverse roles in adherence, aggregation, motility, signaling, and macromolecular transport. Here we describe two analytical approaches to study assembly of type 4 pili and of pseudopili produced by type 2 protein secretion systems: the shearing assay and immunofluorescence microscopy. These complementary antibody-based methods allow for semiquantitative analysis of fiber assembly. The shearing assay can be scaled up to yield crude extracts of pili that can be further analyzed by electron and atomic force microscopy or by mass spectrometry."
"Breaking the resolution limit of conventional microscopy by super-resolution microscopy (SRM) led to many new biological insights into protein assemblies at the nanoscale. Here we provide detailed protocols for single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) to image the structure of a protein complex. As examples, we show how to acquire single- and dual-color super-resolution images of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and dual-color 3D data on actin and paxillin in focal adhesions."
"A proteomic platform for global analysis of protein complexes and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is described. Briefly, after comprehensive physiochemical separation of soluble protein extracts using non-denaturing ion exchange chromatography (IEX), each fraction is subjected to quantitative tandem mass spectrometry analysis."
"Cross-linking and mass spectrometry is used more and more for the structural analysis of large proteins and protein complexes. Although essentially a low-resolution method, it avoids the main drawbacks of established structural techniques. Particularly, it is largely insensitive to the inherent flexibility of the studied complexes and is applied under native conditions. It is also applicable to nearly every structural system. Therefore, cross-linking and mass spectrometry is the method of choice for elucidating the general architecture of protein complexes. Advances in instrumentation, techniques, and software now allow every lab that is working with proteins to apply the approach without much difficulty. The most specialized step in the workflow, the mass spectrometry measurement, can be done in most facilities that are performing standard proteomics. We detail here a step-by-step protocol of how to successfully apply the approach in collaboration with the mass spectrometry facility in your institution."
"Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) can provide valuable information about binding, allostery, and other conformational effects of interaction in protein complexes. For protein-ligand complexes, where the ligand may be a small molecule, peptide, nucleotide, or another protein(s), a typical experiment measures HDX in the protein alone and then compares that with HDX for the protein when part of the complex. Multiple factors are critical in the design and implementation of such experiments, including thoughtful consideration of the percent protein bound, the effects of the labeling protocol on the protein complex, and the dynamic range of the analysis method. With careful planning and techniques, HDX MS analysis of protein complexes can be very informative."
"The focus of modern molecular biology on protein structure and function has reached unparalleled levels. Whether interacting with nucleic acids or other proteins, protein contacts are the basis for fine-tuning all cellular processes. It is for this reason imperative that protein interactions are studied in ways that reflect actual events taking place inside living cells.Here, we describe in detail a method that combines the residue-level resolution provided by structural biology with physiological studies inside living cells, with the overall goal of explaining the contribution of protein-protein interactions in cellular processes. We use as a powerful example our experience with the DNA exit gate interface of the chromosomal cohesin complex, and we argue that this methodology may be followed to address similar questions within any protein complex and in various model systems."
"Recent advances in technology have enabled single-particle electron microscopy (EM) to rapidly progress as a preferred tool to study protein assemblies. Newly developed materials and methods present viable alternatives to traditional EM specimen preparation. Improved lipid monolayer purification reagents offer considerable flexibility, while ultrathin silicon nitride films provide superior imaging properties to the structural study of protein complexes. Here, we describe the steps for combining monolayer purification with silicon nitride microchips to create a tunable approach for the EM community."
"Electron cryo-tomography and subtomogram averaging enable visualization of protein complexes in situ, in three dimensions, in a near-native frozen-hydrated state to nanometer resolutions. To achieve this, intact cells are vitrified and imaged over a range of tilts within an electron microscope. These images can subsequently be reconstructed into a three-dimensional volume representation of the sample cell. Because complexes are visualized in situ, crucial insights into their mechanism, assembly process, and dynamic interactions with other proteins become possible. To illustrate the electron cryo-tomography workflow for visualizing protein complexes in situ, we describe our workflow of preparing samples, imaging, and image processing using Leginon for data collection, IMOD for image reconstruction, and PEET for subtomogram averaging."
"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are responsible for sustaining life-long blood formation or hematopoiesis and are also used clinically in a form of bone marrow transplantation, a curative cellular therapy for a range of hematological diseases. HSCs are maintained throughout adult life by a complex biological niche or microenvironment, which is thought to be composed of a range of cellular, molecular, and metabolic components. The metabolic components of the HSC niche have become of increasing interest over the past few years. It is now well-recognized that metabolic activity is intimately linked to HSC function, and dysregulation of these metabolic pathways result in hematological pathologies such as leukemia. Here, we review the recent progress in this field including our current understanding of the ""dietary"" requirements of HSCs and how nutrition influences HSC activity. These recent findings have suggested promising new metabolic approaches to improve clinical HSC transplantation and leukemia therapies."
"Chromosome conformation capture assays have been established, modified, and enhanced for over a decade with the purpose of studying nuclear organization. A recently published method uses in situ Hi-C followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) to enrich the overall yield of significant genome-wide interactions mediated by a specific protein. Here we applied a modified version of the HiChIP protocol to retrieve the significant contacts mediated by architectural protein CP190 in D. melanogaster cells."
"Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is the most widely used method to analyze protein-DNA interactions in vivo. Coupled with next generation sequencing, ChIP-seq experiments map protein-DNA interactions in a genome-wide fashion. Here we describe a novel method called nasChIP-seq for mapping genome-wide occupancy of posttranslationally modified histones or transcription factors on newly replicated DNA."
"DNA methylation is a crucial regulatory mechanism of gene expression, affected in many human pathologies. Therefore, it is not surprising that nowadays, in the era of high-throughput methods, a lot of data sets representing DNA methylation in various conditions are available and the amount of such data keeps growing. In this chapter, we discuss those aspects of experiment planning and data analysis, which we consider the most important for reliability and reproducibility of DNA methylation studies: usage of replicates, data quality control at various stages, selection of a statistical model, and incorporation of DNA methylation into the multi-omics analysis."
"Somatic, and in a minor scale also germ line, epigenetic aberrations are fundamental to carcinogenesis, cancer progression, and tumor phenotype. DNA methylation is the most extensively studied and arguably the best understood epigenetic mechanisms that become altered in cancer. Both somatic loss of methylation (hypomethylation) and gain of methylation (hypermethylation) are found in the genome of malignant cells. In general, the cancer cell epigenome is globally hypomethylated, while some regions-typically gene-associated CpG islands-become hypermethylated. Given the profound impact that DNA methylation exerts on the transcriptional profile and genomic stability of cancer cells, its characterization is essential to fully understand the complexity of cancer biology, improve tumor classification, and ultimately advance cancer patient management and treatment. A plethora of methods have been devised to analyze and quantify DNA methylation alterations. Several of the early-developed methods relied on the use of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, whose activity depends on the methylation status of their recognition sequences. Among these techniques, methylation-sensitive amplification length polymorphism (MS-AFLP) was developed in the early 2000s, and successfully adapted from its original gel electrophoresis fingerprinting format to a microarray format that notably increased its throughput and allowed the quantification of the methylation changes. This array-based platform interrogates over 9500 independent loci putatively amplified by the MS-AFLP technique, corresponding to the NotI sites mapped throughout the human genome."
"Imprinting disorders are a group of congenital diseases that can result from multiple mechanisms affecting imprinted gene dosage including cytogenetic aberration and epigenetic anomalies. Quantification of CpG methylation and correct copy-number calling is required for molecular diagnosis. Methylation-sensitive multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) is a multiplex method that accurately measures both parameters in a single assay. This technique relies upon the ligation of MLPA probe oligonucleotides and digestion of the genomic DNA-probe hybrid complexes with the Hha1 methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease prior to fluorescent PCR amplification with a single primer pair. Since each targeted probe contains stuffer sequence of varying length, each interrogated position is visualized as an amplicon of different size upon capillary electrophoresis."
"Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples usually yield fragmented DNA, which is incompatible with traditional Infinium Methylation beadchips. In this chapter, we aim to explain in detail all the processes carried out in order to obtain high-quality methylation profiles from FFPE samples through an FFPE restoration procedure. High-throughput methylation profiling platforms such as the Infinium Methylation beadchips have been extensively used by the scientific community to elucidate many hypotheses in multiple scenarios, now with the incorporation of FFPE samples to these platforms, a myriad of new opportunities is being opened."
"DNA methylation is a dynamic epigenetic mark that characterizes different cellular developmental stages, including tissue-specific profiles. This CpG dinucleotide modification cooperates in the regulation of the output of the cellular genetic content, in both healthy and pathological conditions. According to endogenous and exogenous stimuli, DNA methylation is involved in gene transcription, alternative splicing, imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and control of transposable elements. When these dinucleotides are organized in dense regions are called CpG islands (CGIs), being commonly known as transcriptional regulatory regions frequently associated with the promoter region of several genes. In cancer, promoter DNA hypermethylation events sustained the mechanistic hypothesis of epigenetic transcriptional silencing of an increasing number of tumor suppressor genes. CGI hypomethylation-mediated reactivation of oncogenes was also documented in several cancer types. In this chapter, we aim to summarize the functional consequences of the differential DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides in cancer, focused in CGIs. Interestingly, cancer methylome is being recently explored, looking for biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and predictors of drug response."
"CpG islands are regions of vertebrate genomes that often function as gene regulatory elements and are associated with most gene promoters. CpG island elements usually contain nonmethylated CpG dinucleotides, while the remainder of the genome is pervasively methylated. We developed a biochemical approach called biotinylated CxxC affinity purification (BioCAP) to unbiasedly isolate regions of the genome that contain nonmethylated CpG dinucleotides. The resulting highly pure nonmethylated DNA is easily analyzed by quantitative PCR to interrogate specific loci or via massively parallel sequencing to yield genome-wide profiles."
"The discovery of CpG islands (CGIs) and the study of their structure and properties run parallel to the development of molecular biology in the last two decades of the twentieth century and to the development of high-throughput genomic technologies at the turn of the millennium. First identified as discrete G + C-rich regions of unmethylated DNA in several vertebrates, CGIs were soon found to display additional distinctive chromatin features from the rest of the genome in terms of accessibility and of the epigenetic modifications of their histones. These features, together with their colocalization with promoters and with origins of DNA replication in mammals, highlighted their relevance in the regulation of genomic processes. Recent approaches have shown with unprecedented detail the dynamics and diversity of the epigenetic landscape of CGIs during normal development and under pathological conditions. Also, comparative analyses across species have started revealing how CGIs evolve and contribute to the evolution of the vertebrate genome."
"Factors associated with the increased usage of electronic devices, wireless technologies and mobile phones nowadays are present in increasing amounts in our environment. All living organisms are constantly affected by electromagnetic radiation which causes serious environmental pollution. The distribution and density of ticks in natural habitats is influenced by a complex of abiotic and biotic factors. Exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) constitutes a potential cause altering the presence and distribution of ticks in the environment. Our main objective was to determine the affinity of Dermacentor reticulatus ticks towards RF-EMF exposure. Originally designed and constructed radiation-shielded tube (RST) test was used to test the affinity of ticks under controlled laboratory conditions. All test were performed in an electromagnetic compatibility laboratory in an anechoic chamber. Ticks were irradiated using a Double-Ridged Waveguide Horn Antenna to RF-EMF at 900 and 5000 MHz, 0 MHz was used as control. The RF-EMF exposure to 900 MHz induced a higher concentration of ticks on irradiated arm of RST as opposed to the RF-EMF at 5000 MHz, which caused an escape of ticks to the shielded arm. This study represents the first experimental evidence of RF-EMF preference in D. reticulatus. The projection of obtained results to the natural environment could help assess the risk of tick borne diseases and could be a tool of preventive medicine."
"A multigene phylogeny including 24 Rhipicephalus species from the Afrotropical and Mediterranean regions, based on mitochondrial DNA genes (COI, 12S and 16S), was constructed based on Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood estimations. The phylogenetic reconstruction revealed 31 Rhipicephalus clades, which include the first molecular records of Rhipicephalus duttoni (Neumann), and Rhipicephalus senegalensis (Koch). Our results support the R. pulchellus, R. evertsi and R. pravus complexes as more phylogenetically close to Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) than to the remaining Rhipicephalus clades, suggesting two main monophyletic groups within the genus. Additionally, the phenotypic resembling R. sanguineus s.l. and Rhipicephalus turanicus (Pomerantsev) are here represented by nine clades, of which none of the R. turanicus assemblages appeared as distributed in the Iberian Peninsula. These results not only indicate that both species include more cryptic diversity than the already reported, but also suggest that R. turanicus distribution is less extended than previously anticipated. This analysis allowed to improve species identification by exposing cryptic species and reinforced mtDNA markers suitability for intra/inter-species clarification analyses. Incorporating new species molecular records to improve phylogenetic clarification can significantly improve ticks' identification methods which will have epidemiologic implications on public health."
"Synthetic biology builds upon the techniques and successes of genetics, molecular biology, and metabolic engineering by applying engineering principles to the design of biological systems. The field still faces substantial challenges, including long development times, high rates of failure, and poor reproducibility. One method to ameliorate these problems would be to improve the exchange of information about designed systems between laboratories. The synthetic biology open language (SBOL) has been developed as a standard to support the specification and exchange of biological design information in synthetic biology, filling a need not satisfied by other pre-existing standards. This document details version 2.2.0 of SBOL that builds upon version 2.1.0 published in last year's JIB special issue. In particular, SBOL 2.2.0 includes improved description and validation rules for genetic design provenance, an extension to support combinatorial genetic designs, a new class to add non-SBOL data as attachments, a new class for genetic design implementations, and a description of a methodology to describe the entire design-build-test-learn cycle within the SBOL data model."
"In this study, a fungal isolate was isolated from avocado fruit collected from a market in Makkah city, Saudi Arabia, and identified as Neopestalotiopsis clavispora ASU1. The biomass of Neopestalotiopsis clavispora ASU1 was used as a natural bio-sorbent for removal of Cd(II) and Zn(II) from aqueous solutions. Characterization of fungal biomass was performed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray Diffractometer, and BET surface area. Different factors on Cd(II) and Zn(II) biosorption were studied to evaluate the maximum conditions for metals biosorption. The (qmax) for Cd(II) and Zn (II) by N. clavispora ASU1 calculated from the Langmuir adsorption isotherm was 185.3?±?0.25 and 153.8?±?0.21?mg/g, respectively. Based on r2, the equilibrium biosorption isotherms fitted well with Langmuir model than Freundlich isotherm. The adsorption kinetics was studied, and the biosorption followed to the pseudo-second-order model. Thus, the current study indicated that the biomass of N. clavispora ASU1 is an effective adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions."
"A novel biphenyl-derived salicylhydrazone Schiff base (BSS) fluorescent probes for highly sensitive and selective identification of Cu2+has been synthesized. In addition, the recognition has been proved experimentally. The results indicated that the complex forms a 1:1 complex with Cu2+shows fluorescent quenching. Furthermore, the detection limit of 1.54×10-8M. More interesting, the probe BSS not only have a good biocompatibility in living cells, but also the sense behavior of Cu2+in the cell nucleus."
"Polyphenol-rich products such as fruit juices have been found to have strong antioxidant capacities and to induce potent endothelium-dependent relaxation. We evaluated whether the commercial blackcurrant juices induced endothelium-dependent relaxation of isolated coronary arteries can be related to their antioxidant capacity and/or phenolic content.Six different commercial blackcurrant juices were selected. Their main phenolic compounds were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and antioxidant capacity was evaluated by spectrometric methods. Vascular reactivity studies with these juices were done using isolated porcine coronary arteries.The six different commercial blackcurrant juices induced relaxation ranging from 21% to 100% at the concentration of 0.5% volume per volume (v/v). The relaxation induced at 0.5% v/v was not correlated to their antioxidant capacity measured by either oxygen radical antioxidant capacity or DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assays and also not to the ascorbic acid, total polyphenols, total flavanols, and total phenolic acid contents. In contrast, the amplitude of the relaxation was correlated to the total anthocyanins content and the individual anthocyanin concentration.Correlations between relaxation amplitude and total anthocyanin or individual anthocyanin contents are of interest for the development of functional blackcurrant beverages with the potential to promote vascular protection."
"Phthalates have been extensively used as plasticizers in various fields, including food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industry. Those compounds do not form covalent bonds to substances they are being added to, and thus they may migrate easily and penetrate various products used every day. They may reach organisms with air, food, or by a direct skin contact. Significant levels of phthalates and their metabolites are found in urine, breast milk, blood serum, venous blood, and cord blood. The purpose of this study was to assess the simple toxicity (haemolysis) and programmed death (eryptosis) caused by following phthalates: di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) and their metabolites: mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) in vitro in human RBCs. RBCs were incubated with the above mentioned compounds at concentrations ranging between 0.5 and 500??g/mL for 24?h. Obtained results demonstrated that DBP and BBP possess higher haemolytic properties compared to their metabolites. The lethal concentration (LC50) was determined. The value was 126.37?±?5.94??g/mL for DBP, and 103.65?±?4.03??g/mL for BBP, and for metabolites the LC50value was over 500??g/mL. All compounds induced eryptosis causing translocation of phosphatidylserine, increased cytosolic calcium ions level, increased caspase-3 and calpain activation in human erythrocytes. BBP caused translocation of phosphatidylserine at a lower concentration compared to DBP. In case of other parameters, more pronounced changes were evoked by DBP at lower concentrations. Metabolites showed a significantly lower toxicity compared to parent compounds."
"Modern chemistry aims to identify outstanding photocatalytic materials for antibiotic degradation given the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Herein, highly efficient heterojunction photocatalysts composed of Bi2WO6nanoflowers (BW) and g-C3N4nanosheets (CNNs) were successfully synthesized. The Bi2WO6/g-C3N4(BW/CNNs) were presented for Ceftriaxone sodium degradation in the aquatic environment at low concentrations under visible light irradiation. The 40%-BW/CNNs showed excellent photocatalytic activity, and approximately 94.50% Ceftriaxone sodium was degraded under visible lightirradiation for 120?min. h+and O2-played major roles compared with ·OH in the photocatalytic process. The degradation mechanism and the intermediate products were proposed to better understand the reaction process. Moreover, the as-prepared photocatalysts were highly stable in recycling photocatalytic experiments. Therefore, the photocatalysts prepared in the study showed outstanding photocatalytic activity and potential applications in inhibiting environmental pollution. In addition, this work provides a new insight for constructing other high-performance, low-cost photocatalysts for wastewater treatment."
"The class Nassophorea includes the microthoracids and nassulids, which share morphological similarities in their somatic kinetids and cytopharyngeal baskets. The monophyly of this clade has been challenged by small subunit rRNA gene sequences and multi-gene analyses that do not provide strong support. To provide a more robust test of the monophyly of the Nassophorea, phylogenomic analyses were based on 124 genes derived from the single-cell transcriptomes of the microthoracid Pseudomicrothorax dubius and the nassulid Furgasonia blochmanni. The nassulid Nassula sorex from the Culture Centre for Algae and Protozoa was also included, but this isolate was discovered to have been misidentified. We first redescribe, using light and scanning electron microscopical techniques, this ""N. sorex"" as a new species of Nassula, Nassula variabilis n. sp., characterized by its highly variable nassulid frange. We have sequenced the single-cell transcriptomes to obtain data for phylogenomic analyses. These gave robust support for the Nassophorea, which are sister to a clade of Colpodea species. If our topology truly represents the order of divergence of taxa, a cytopharyngeal basket with microtubular nematodesmata and with Y and Z microtubular ribbons was likely an ancestral feature, at least of the Phyllopharyngea, Colpodea, Nassophorea, and Oligohymenophorea."
"A novel virus was identified in the white-backed planthopper (Sogatella furcifera, Hemiptera: Delphacidae) and tentatively named Sogatella furcifera hepe-like virus (SfHeV). Its genome is a linear, single-stranded monopartite RNA, 7,312 nucleotides (nt) long with a 66-nt 5' UTR, 54-nt 3' UTR, and 28-nt polyA, showing typical genomic features of viruses in the family Hepeviridae, but highly divergent from known members in the family, with amino acid sequence identities of only 20.6-23% (ORF1), 13.1-18.8% (ORF2) and 1.9-11% (ORF3). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SfHeV was closer to cutthroat trout virus (CTV), but did not cluster with any members of the family. SfHeV is the first hepe-like virus identified in a hemipteran insect and was detected in all developmental stages suggesting the presence of some level of vertical transmission. On the basis of these data, we propose that SfHeV represents a novel clade in the family Hepeviridae and tentatively name the genus Insecthepevirus."
"Intervertebral disc degeneration and associated low back and neck pain is a ubiquitous health condition that affects millions of people world-wide, and causes high incidence of disability and enormous medical/societal costs. However, lack of appropriate small animal models with spontaneous disease onset has impeded our ability to understand the pathogenetic mechanisms that characterize and drive the degenerative process. We report, for the first time, early onset spontaneous disc degeneration in SM/J mice known for their poor regenerative capacities compared to ""super-healer"" LG/J mice. In SM/J mice, degenerative process was marked by decreased nucleus pulposus (NP) cellularity and changes in matrix composition at P7, 4, and 8?weeks with increased severity by 17?weeks. Distinctions between NP and annulus fibrosus (AF) or endplate cartilage were lost, and NP and AF of SM/J mice showed higher histological grades. There was increased NP cell death in SM/J mice with decreased phenotypic marker expression. Polarized microscopy and FTIR spectroscopy demonstrated replacement of glycosaminoglycan-rich NP matrix with collagenous fibrous tissue. The levels of ARGxx were increased in, indicating higher aggrecan turnover. Furthermore, an aberrant expression of collagen X and MMP13 was observed in the NP of SM/J mice, along with elevated expression of Col10a1, Ctgf, and Runx2, markers of chondrocyte hypertrophy. Likewise, expression of Enpp1 as well as Alpl was higher, suggesting NP cells of SM/J mice promote dystrophic mineralization. There was also a decrease in several pathways necessary for NP cell survival and function including Wnt and VEGF signaling. Importantly, SM/J discs were stiffer, had decreased height, and poor vertebral bone quality, suggesting compromised motion segment mechanical functionality. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that SM/J mouse strain recapitulates many salient features of human disc degeneration, and serves as a novel small animal model."
"Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) arise from the interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to combine bioinformatics and functional studies to identify miRNAs that contribute to obesity and T2D.A computational framework (miR-QTL-Scan) was applied by combining QTL, miRNA prediction, and transcriptomics in order to enhance the power for the discovery of miRNAs as regulative elements. Expression of several miRNAs was analyzed in human adipose tissue and blood cells and miR-31 was manipulated in a human fat cell line.In 17 partially overlapping QTL for obesity and T2D 170 miRNAs were identified. Four miRNAs (miR-15b, miR-30b, miR-31, miR-744) were recognized in gWAT (gonadal white adipose tissue) and six (miR-491, miR-455, miR-423-5p, miR-132-3p, miR-365-3p, miR-30b) in BAT (brown adipose tissue). To provide direct functional evidence for the achievement of the miR-QTL-Scan, miR-31 located in the obesity QTL Nob6 was experimentally analyzed. Its expression was higher in gWAT of obese and diabetic mice and humans than of lean controls. Accordingly, 10 potential target genes involved in insulin signaling and adipogenesis were suppressed. Manipulation of miR-31 in human SGBS adipocytes affected the expression of GLUT4, PPAR?, IRS1, and ACACA. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) miR-15b levels were correlated to baseline blood glucose concentrations and might be an indicator for diabetes.Thus, miR-QTL-Scan allowed the identification of novel miRNAs relevant for obesity and T2D."
"Wound healing is essential for skin repair after injury, and consists of hemostasis, inflammation, re-epithelialization and remodeling phases. Successful re-epithelialization, which relies on proliferation and migration of epidermal keratinocytes, requires reduction in tissue inflammation. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the transition from inflammation to re-epithelialization will help to better understand the principles of wound healing. Currently, the in vivo functions of specific microRNAs in wound healing are not fully understood. We observed that miR-31 expression is strongly induced in wound edge keratinocytes, and is directly regulated by the activity of NF-?B and STAT3 signaling pathways during inflammation phase. We utilized miR-31 loss-of-function mouse models to demonstrate that miR-31 promotes keratinocyte proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, miR-31 activates the RAS/MAPK signaling by directly targeting Rasa1, Spred1, Spred2 and Spry4, which are negative regulators of the RAS/MAPK pathway. Knockdown of these miR-31 targets at least partially rescues the delayed scratch wound re-epithelialization phenotype observed in vitro in miR-31 knockdown keratinocytes. Taken together, these findings identify miR-31 as an important cell-autonomous mediator during the transition from inflammation to re-epithelialization phases of wound healing, suggesting a therapeutic potential for miR-31 in skin injury repair."
"Harvesting whole-tree biomass for biofuel combustion intensifies removal of nutrients from the ecosystem. This can be partly amended by applying ash from the combustion back to the system and thus recycle the nutrients. However, besides being rich in inorganic nutrients, ash also contains trace amounts of heavy metals. Due to the risk of toxic effects and trophic transfer of heavy metals, especially cadmium, legislation usually restricts the use of ash as a soil amendment. In order to provide researchers and governmental agencies with a tool to assess the risk of cadmium bioaccumulation in specific soil systems after ash application, we review: 1) the properties of ash; 2) the chemical and toxic properties of cadmium; 3) the key factors affecting cadmium bioavailability, cadmium uptake-, storage- and elimination-abilities in soil organisms and the risk of cadmium accumulation and biomagnification in the soil food web; 4) how ash impact on soil can change the risk of cadmium bioaccumulation. We conclude that for assessing the risk of cadmium bioaccumulation for specific sites, it is necessary to consider both the type and composition of ash, the soil conditions and organism composition on the site. On a general basis, we conclude that granulated ashes low in cadmium content, applied to low pH soils with high organic matter content, in systems with low abundances of earthworms, isopods and gastropods, will have a low risk of cadmium accumulation."
"Androgen receptor signaling is critical for prostate adenocarcinoma, even after androgen deprivation therapy. Persistence of intratumoral androgens has been found in castration-resistant prostate cancer and attributed to increased in situ synthesis. Recently, Sharifi and colleagues reported an additional mechanism that can enhance local androgenic exposure: downregulation of an androgen-inactivating enzyme."
"Mutations in CPLANE1 (previously known as C5orf42) cause Oral-Facial-Digital Syndrome type VI (OFD6) as well as milder Joubert syndrome (JS) phenotypes. Seven new cases from five unrelated families diagnosed with pure OFD6 were systematically examined. Based on the clinical manifestations of these patients and those described in the literature, we revised the diagnostic features of OFD6 and include the seven most common characteristics: 1) molar tooth sign, 2) tongue hamartoma and/or lobulated tongue, 3) additional frenula, 4) mesoaxial polydactyly of hands, 5) preaxial polydactyly of feet, 6) syndactyly and/or bifid toe, and 7) hypothalamic hamartoma. By whole or targeted exome sequencing, we identified seven novel germline recessive mutations in CPLANE1, including missense, nonsense, frameshift and canonical splice site variants, all causing OFD6 in these patients. Since CPLANE1 is also mutated in JS patients, we examined whether a genotype-phenotype correlation could be established. We gathered and compared 46 biallelic CPLANE1 mutations reported in 32 JS and 26 OFD6 patients. Since no clear correlation between paired genotypes and clinical outcomes could be determined, we concluded that patient's genetic background and gene modifiers may modify the penetrance and expressivity of CPLANE1 causal alleles. To conclude, our study provides a comprehensive view of the phenotypic range, the genetic basis and genotype-phenotype association in OFD6 and JS. The updated phenotype scoring system together with the identification of new CPLANE1 mutations will help clinicians and geneticists reach a more accurate diagnosis for JS-related disorders."
"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, can cause serious health problems and produces several virulence factors. The most important of these factors is biofilm. Many studies suggest administration of new generation of antibiotics, as P. aeruginosa biofilm has developed high resistance to antimicrobial drugs. Emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains has resulted in screening biofilm inhibitors from natural products or modified from natural compounds. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the inhibitory effects (antibacterial and antibiofilm) of Juglans regia L. extract on biofilm formation by clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa.Samples collected from burn, tracheal and urine infections of hospitalized patients (Shahid Motahari Hospital, Tehran, Iran) were identified as P. aeruginosa using traditional biochemical tests. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of isolates was performed using disk diffusion method. The microtiter plate method was used to evaluate the ability of pathogenic strains in producing biofilm. Antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of aqueous and methanol Juglans regia L. leaf extracts were determined by microtiter plate method.46.7% of P. aeruginosa isolates (n?=?50) were resistant to gentamicin and 100% of them could form a biofilm. All isolates (100%) exhibited MDR phenotype. Various concentrations of Juglans regia L. extracts exhibited significant effects on the growth and biofilm inhibition of the isolates. In addition, aqueous Juglans regia L. leaf extract had better inhibition activity on planktonic growth, and methanol extract was more effective on inhibiting biofilm of P. aeruginosa.The results of this study indicate that antibiotic-resistant strains were significantly associated with biofilm formation. The J. regia L. extract, at various concentrations, may provide an alternative to control biofilm-related infections caused by P. aeruginosa. Further analyses are needed to validate the antibiofilm activity of these medicinal plants."
"Mast cells (MCs) have important immunoregulatory roles in skin inflammation. Annexin A1 (ANXA1) is an endogenous anti-inflammatory protein that can be expressed by mast cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, epithelial and T cells. This study investigated MCs heterogeneity and ANXA1 expression in human dermatoses with special emphasis in leprosy. Sixty one skin biopsies from 2 groups were investigated: 40 newly diagnosed untreated leprosy patients (18 reaction-free, 11 type 1 reaction/T1R, 11 type 2 reaction/T2R); 21 patients with other dermatoses. Tryptase/try+ and chymase/chy + phenotypic markers and toluidine blue stained intact/degranulated MC counts/mm2were evaluated. Try+/chy+MCs and ANXA1 were identified by streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase immunostaining and density was reported. In leprosy, degranulated MCs outnumbered intact ones regardless of the leprosy form (from tuberculoid/TT to lepromatous/LL), leprosy reactions (reactional/reaction-free) and type of reaction (T1R/T2R). Compared to other dermatoses, leprosy skin lesions showed lower numbers of degranulated and intact MCs. Try+MCs outnumbered chy+in leprosy lesions (reaction-free/reactional, particularly in T2R), but not in other dermatoses. Compared to other dermatoses, ANXA1 expression, which is also expressed in mast cells, was higher in the epidermis of leprosy skin lesions, independently of reactional episode. In leprosy, higher MC degranulation and differential expression of try+/chy+subsets independent of leprosy type and reaction suggest that the Mycobacterium leprae infection itself dictates the inflammatory MCs activation in skin lesions. Higher expression of ANXA1 in leprosy suggests its potential anti-inflammatory role to maintain homeostasis preventing tissue and nerve damage."
"We describe the genome sequence of Pseudomonas reinekei MT1 and Achromobacter xylosoxidans MT3, the most abundant members of a bacterial community capable of degrading chloroaromatic compounds. The MT1 genome contains open reading frames encoding enzymes responsible for the catabolism of chlorosalicylate, methylsalicylate, chlorophenols, phenol, benzoate, p-coumarate, phenylalanine, and phenylacetate. On the other hand, the MT3 strain genome possesses no ORFs to metabolize chlorosalicylates; instead the bacterium is capable of metabolizing nitro-phenolic and phenolic compounds, which can be used as the only carbon and energy source by MT3. We also confirmed that MT3 displays the genetic machinery for the metabolism of chlorocathecols and chloromuconates, where the latter are toxic compounds secreted by MT1 when degrading chlorosalicylates. Altogether, this work will advance our fundamental understanding of bacterial interactions."
"17?-estradiol (E2) has numerous rapid effects on the brain and behavior. This review focuses on the rapid effects of E2on aggression, an important social behavior, in songbirds. First, we highlight the contributions of studies on song sparrows, which reveal that seasonal changes in the environment profoundly influence the capacity of E2to rapidly alter aggressive behavior. E2administration to male song sparrows increases aggression within 20?min in the non-breeding season, but not in the breeding season. Furthermore, E2rapidly modulates several phosphoproteins in the song sparrow brain. In particular, E2rapidly affects pCREB in the medial preoptic nucleus, in the non-breeding season only. Second, we describe studies of the white-throated sparrow, which reveal how a genetic polymorphism may influence the rapid effects of E2on aggression. In this species, a chromosomal rearrangement that includes ESR1, which encodes estrogen receptor ? (ER?), affects ER? expression in the brain and the ability of E2to rapidly promote aggression. Third, we summarize studies showing that aggressive interactions rapidly affect levels of E2and other steroids, both in the blood and in specific brain regions, and the emerging potential for steroid profiling by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Such studies of songbirds demonstrate the value of an ethologically informed approach, in order to reveal how steroids act rapidly on the brain to alter naturally-occurring behavior."
"Phosphorus (P) limitation has been demonstrated for micro-polluted surface water denitrification treatment in previous study. In this paper, a lab-scale comparative study of autotrophic denitrification (ADN) and heterotrophic denitrification (HDN) in phosphorus-limited surface water was investigated, aiming to find out the optimal nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) ratio and the mechanism of the effect of P limitation on ADN and HDN. Furthermore, the optimal denitrification process was applied to the West Lake denitrification project, aiming to improve the water quality of the West Lake from worse than grade V to grade IV (GB3838-2006). The lab-scale study showed that the lack of P indeed inhibited HDN more greatly than ADN. The optimal N/P ratio for ADN and HDN was 25 and a 0.15?mg PO43--P L-1of microbial available phosphorus (MAP) was observed. P additions could greatly enhance the resistance of ADN and HDN to hydraulic loading shock. Besides, The P addition could effectively stimulate the HDN performance via enriching the heterotrophic denitrifiers and the denitrifying phosphate-accumulating organisms (DNPAOs). Additionally, HDN was more effective and cost-effective than ADN for treating P-limited surface water. The study of the full-scale HDBF (heterotrophic denitrification biofilter) indicated that the denitrification performance was periodically impacted by P limitation, particularly at low water temperatures."
"Diabetic nephropathy is the single strongest predictor of mortality in patients with diabetes. The development of overt nephropathy involves important inter-individual variations, even after adjusting for potential confounding influences of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Genome-wide transcriptome studies have reported the activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and there is mounting indication of the role of genetic factors.We screened nine genetic variations in three cytokine genes (TNF-?, IL-6 and IL-?) in 1326 unrelated subjects comprising of healthy controls (n?=?464), type 2 diabetics with nephropathy (DN, n?=?448) and type 2 diabetes without nephropathy (T2D, n?=?414) by sequence-specific amplification. Functional implication of SNPs was elucidated by correlation studies and relative gene expression using Realtime-Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).Individual SNP analysis showed highest association of IL-1? rs16944-TT genotype (OR?=?3.51, 95%CI?=?2.36-5.21, P?=?0.001) and TNF-? rs1800629-AA genotype (OR?=?2.75, 95% CI?=?1.64-4.59, P?=?0.001) with T2D and DN respectively. The haplotype frequency showed significant risk of seven combinations among T2D and four combinations among DN subjects. The highest risk of T2D and DN was associated with GGTGAGTTT (OR?=?4.25, 95%CI?=?3.3-14.20, P?=?0.0016) and GACGACCTT (OR?=?21.3, 95%CI?=?15.1-28.33, P?=?0.026) haplotypes respectively. Relative expression by RT-qPCR showed increased cytokine expression in cases as compared to controls. TNF-? expression was increased by more than four-folds (n-fold?=?4.43?±?1.11) in DN. TNF-?, IL-6 and IL-1? transcript levels were significantly modulated by promoter region SNPs.The present study implicates a strong association between cytokine TNF-?, IL-6 and IL-1? gene promoter polymorphisms and modulation of transcript levels with susceptibility to nephropathy in diabetes subjects."
"Targeted therapies, although contributing to survival improvement in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), are expensive and may cause adverse effects. Therefore, confirming that patients are responding to these therapies is extremely important. Currently, follow-up is performed using radiographic evaluation, which has its limitations. Liquid biopsies, reflecting real-time tumor characteristics, hold great potential in monitoring tumor disease.Blood samples were collected at different time points during treatment of 24 mCRC patients. Mutation and NPY methylation picoliter droplet-based digital PCR (ddPCR) assays were performed on circulating DNA to investigate whether these assays can be used for disease monitoring.The results of the mutation and methylation assays were correlated with each other and corresponded with the results of radiographic evaluation. There was a steep decrease in circulating tumor DNA levels immediately after treatment initiation. Furthermore, circulating tumor DNA levels were increased in progressive samples and were undetectable in patients undergoing curative surgery.This prospective study showed that tumor-specific mutation and NPY methylation ddPCR assays performed on circulating DNA can be used for the follow-up of mCRC patients during treatment and could complement current follow-up methods. The analysis of NPY methylation is promising, as it has the additional advantage that no prior knowledge of tumor mutations is needed."
"Sorbitol-6-phosphate 2-dehydrogenases (S6PDH) catalyze the interconversion of d-sorbitol 6-phosphate to d-fructose 6-phosphate. In the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora the S6PDH SrlD is used by the bacterium to utilize sorbitol, which is used for carbohydrate transport in the host plants belonging to the Amygdaloideae subfamily (e.g., apple, pear, and quince). We have determined the crystal structure of S6PDH SrlD at 1.84?Å resolution, which is the first structure of an EC 1.1.1.140 enzyme. Kinetic data show that SrlD is much faster at oxidizing d-sorbitol 6-phosphate than in reducing d-fructose 6-phosphate, however, equilibrium analysis revealed that only part of the d-sorbitol 6-phosphate present in the in vitro environment is converted into d-fructose 6-phosphate. The comparison of the structures of SrlD and Rhodobacter sphaeroides sorbitol dehydrogenase showed that the tetrameric quaternary structure, the catalytic residues and a conserved aspartate residue that confers specificity for NAD+over NADP+are preserved. Analysis of the SrlD cofactor and substrate binding sites identified residues important for the formation of the complex with cofactor and substrate and in particular the role of Lys42 in selectivity towards the phospho-substrate. The comparison of SrlD backbone with the backbone of 302 short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases showed the conservation of the protein core and identified the variable parts. The SrlD sequence was compared with 500 S6PDH sequences selected by homology revealing that the C-terminal part is more conserved than the N-terminal, the consensus of the catalytic tetrad (Y[SN]AGXA) and a not previously described consensus for the NAD(H) binding."
"HIV-1 Rev mediates the nuclear export of unspliced and partially-spliced viral transcripts for the production of progeny genomes and structural proteins. In this process, four (or more) copies of Rev assemble onto a highly-structured 351-nt region in such viral transcripts, the Rev response element (RRE). How this occurs is not known. The Rev assembly domain has a helical-hairpin structure which associates through three (A-A, B-B and C-C) interfaces. The RRE has the topology of an upper-case letter A, with the two known Rev binding sites mapping onto the legs of the A. We have determined a crystal structure for the Rev assembly domain at 2.25?Å resolution, without resort to either mutations or chaperones. It shows that B-B dimers adopt an arrangement reversed relative to that previously reported, and join through a C-C interface to form tetramers. The new subunit arrangement shows how four Rev molecules can assemble on the two sites on the RRE to form the specificity checkpoint, and how further copies add through A-A interactions. Residues at the C-C interface, specifically the Pro31-Trp45 axis, are a potential target for intervention."
"Self-organization guides robust, spatiotemporally ordered formation of complex tissues and ultimately whole organisms. While products of gene expression serve as building blocks of living matter, how these interact to give rise to tissues of distinct patterns and function remains a central question in biology. Tissue self-organization relies on dynamic interactions between constituents spanning a range of spatiotemporal scales with tuneable chemical and mechanical parameters. This review highlights recent studies dissecting mechanisms of these interactions. We propose that feedback interactions between cell polarity, mechanics, and fate are a key principle underlying tissue self-organization. We also provide a glimpse into how such processes can be studied in future endeavors."
"Trypanosomes and leishmanias are widely known parasites of humans. However, they are just two out of several phylogenetic lineages that constitute the family Trypanosomatidae. Although dixeny - the ability to infect two hosts - is a derived trait of vertebrate-infecting parasites, the majority of trypanosomatids are monoxenous. Like their common ancestor, the monoxenous Trypanosomatidae are mostly parasites or commensals of insects. This review covers recent advances in the study of insect trypanosomatids, highlighting their diversity as well as genetic, morphological and biochemical complexity, which, until recently, was underappreciated. The investigation of insect trypanosomatids is providing an important foundation for understanding the origin and evolution of parasitism, including colonization of vertebrates and the appearance of human pathogens."
"Current therapies in Pancreatic Cancer (PaCa) are ineffective due to deregulated cell cycle driven by landscape mutations. In this study, we show for the first time that tetrandrine (TET) inhibits proliferation of the PaCa cells and inhibits PaCa tumor growth. TET inhibits cell cycle transition at G1/S boundary. TET increased levels of p21Cip1/Waf1and p27Kip1, had no effect on the levels of CDK4/6 proteins and decreased the levels of cyclin D1 and pRb proteins. TET resulted in changes in mRNA levels of cyclin D1 and p21Cip1/Waf1but had no effect on the mRNA of p27Kip1. We show, for the first time in any system, that TET treatment downregulated Skp2, E3 ligase specific for degradation of p27Kip1during the cell cycle. Taken together our results show, that TET indirectly impairs the activities of CDK4/6 to halt deregulated cell cycle and inhibit PaCa tumor growth. These results suggest that TET may serve as a novel agent for treatment of PaCa, for which there is no effective cure to date."
"The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck 1819) is a popular shellfish commonly included in human diet and is routinely used as bioindicator in environmental monitoring programmes worldwide. Recently, metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool both in food research and ecotoxicology for monitoring mussels' freshness and assessing the effects of environmental changes. However, there is still a paucity of data on complete metabolic baseline of mussel tissues. To mitigate this knowledge gap, similarities and differences in metabolite profile of digestive gland (DG), gills (G), and posterior adductor muscle (PAM) of aquaculture-farmed M. galloprovincialis were herein investigated by a proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)-based metabolomic approach and discussed considering their physiological role. A total of 44 metabolites were identified in mussel tissues and grouped in amino acids, energy metabolites, osmolytes, neurotransmitters, nucleotides, alkaloids, and miscellaneous metabolites. A PCA showed that mussel tissues clustered separately from each other, suggesting a clear differentiation in their metabolic profiles. A Venn diagram revealed that mussel DG, G and PAM shared 27 (61.36%) common metabolites, though with different concentrations. Osmolytes were found to dominate the metabolome of all tissues. The DG exhibited higher level of glutathione and carbohydrates. The G showed greater level of osmolytes and the exclusive presence of neurotransmitters, namely acetylcholine and serotonin. In PAM higher levels of energetics-related metabolites were found. Overall, findings from this study are helpful for a better understanding of mussel tissue-specific physiological functions as well as for future NMR-based metabolomic investigations of marine mussel health and safety."
"Cell surface neural adhesion proteins are critical components in the complex orchestration of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and neuritogenesis essential for proper brain construction and behavior. We focused on the impact of two plasticity-associated IgLON family neural adhesion molecules, Neurotrimin (Ntm) and Limbic system associated membrane protein (Lsamp), on mouse behavior and its underlying neural development. Phenotyping neurons derived from the hippocampi of Lsamp-/-, Ntm-/-and Lsamp-/-Ntm-/-mice was performed in parallel with behavioral testing. While the anatomy of mutant brains revealed no gross changes, the Ntm-/-hippocampal neurons exhibited premature sprouting of neurites and manifested accelerated neurite elongation and branching. We propose that Ntm exerts an inhibitory impact on neurite outgrowth, whereas Lsamp appears to be an enhancer of the said process as premature neuritogenesis in Ntm-/-neurons is apparent only in the presence of Lsamp. We also show interplay between Lsamp and Ntm in regulating tissue homeostasis: the impact of Ntm on cellular proliferation was dependent on Lsamp, and Lsamp appeared to be a positive regulator of apoptosis in the presence of Ntm. Behavioral phenotyping indicated test-specific interactions between Lsamp and Ntm. The phenotypes of single mutant lines, such as reduced swimming speed in Morris water maze and increased activity in the elevated plus maze, were magnified in Lsamp-/-Ntm-/-mice. Altogether, evidence both from behavioral experiments and cultured hippocampal cells show combined and differential interactions between Ntm and Lsamp in the formation of hippocampal circuits and behavioral profiles. We demonstrate that mutual interactions between IgLON molecules regulate the initiation of neurite sprouting at very early ages, and even cell-autonomously, independent of their regulation of cell-cell adhesion."
"Radiotherapy (RT) plays a major role in the curative treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore, the ACROP committee was asked by the ESTRO to provide recommendations on target volume delineation for standard clinical scenarios in definitive (chemo)radiotherapy (RT) and adjuvant RT for locally advanced NSCLC. The guidelines given here are a result of the evaluation of a structured questionnaire followed by a consensus discussion, voting and writing procedure within the committee. Hence, we provide advice for methods and time-points of diagnostics and imaging before the start of treatment planning and for the mandatory and optional imaging to be used for planning itself. Concerning target volumes, recommendations are given for GTV delineation of primary tumour and lymph nodes followed by issues related to the delineation of CTVs for definitive and adjuvant radiotherapy. In the context of PTV delineation, recommendations about the management of geometric uncertainties and target motion are given. We further provide our opinions on normal tissue delineation and organisational and responsibility questions in the process of target volume delineation. This guideline intends to contribute to the standardisation and optimisation of the process of RT treatment planning for clinical practice and prospective studies."
"Immune cells play an important role in controlling liver tumorigenesis, viral hepatitis, liver fibrosis and contribute to pathogenesis of liver inflammation and injury. Accumulating evidence suggests the effectiveness of natural killer (NK) cells and Kupffer cells (KCs) against viral hepatitis, hepatocellular damage, liver fibrosis, and carcinogenesis. Activation of natural killer cells provides a novel therapeutic strategy to cure liver related diseases. This review discusses the emerging roles of immune cells in liver disorders and it will provide baseline data to scientists to design better therapies for treatment."
"Polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or neutrophils, are specialist phagocytic cells of the innate immune system. Their primary role is host defence against micro-organisms, which they kill via phagocytosis, followed by release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteolytic enzymes within the phagosome. ROS are generated via the action of the NADPH oxidase (also known as NOX2), in a process termed the 'Respiratory Burst'. This process consumes large amounts of oxygen, which is converted into the highly-reactive superoxide radical O2-and H2O2. Subsequent activation of myeloperoxidase (MPO) generates secondary oxidants and chloroamines that are highly microbiocidal in nature, which together with proteases such as elastase and gelatinase provide a toxic intra-phagosomal environment able to kill a broad range of micro-organisms. However, under certain circumstances such as during an auto-immune response, neutrophils can be triggered to release ROS and proteases extracellularly causing damage to host tissues, modification of host proteins, lipids and DNA and dysregulation of oxidative homeostasis. This review describes the range of ROS species produced by human neutrophils with a focus on the implications of neutrophil redox products in autoimmune inflammation."
"Plant stem cells are the foundation of plant growth and development. The balance of quiescence and division is highly regulated, while ensuring that proliferating cells are protected from the adverse effects of environment fluctuations that may damage the genome. Redox regulation is important in both the activation of proliferation and arrest of the cell cycle upon perception of environmental stress. Within this context, reactive oxygen species serve as 'pro-life' signals with positive roles in the regulation of the cell cycle and survival. However, very little is known about the metabolic mechanisms and redox-sensitive proteins that influence cell cycle progression. We have identified cysteine residues on known cell cycle regulators in Arabidopsis that are potentially accessible, and could play a role in redox regulation, based on secondary structure and solvent accessibility likelihoods for each protein. We propose that redox regulation may function alongside other known posttranslational modifications to control the functions of core cell cycle regulators such as the retinoblastoma protein. Since our current understanding of how redox regulation is involved in cell cycle control is hindered by a lack of knowledge regarding both which residues are important and how modification of those residues alters protein function, we discuss how critical redox modifications can be mapped at the molecular level."
"The Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain (BET) family of proteins are involved in the regulation of gene transcription, and their dysregulation is implicated in several diseases including cancer. BET proteins contain two tandem bromodomains (BD1 and BD2) that independently recognize acetylated-lysine residues and appear to have distinct biological roles. We compared several published co-crystal structures and found five positions near the substrate binding pocket that vary between BET bromodomains. One position located in the ZA loop has unique properties. In BRD2-4, this residue is glutamine in BD1 and lysine in BD2; in BRDT, this residue is arginine in BD1 and asparagine in BD2. Using molecular modeling, we identified differences in the water-mediated network at this position between bromodomains. Molecular dynamics simulations helped rationalize the observed bromodomain selectivity for exemplar BET inhibitors and a congeneric series of tetrahydroquinolines (THQ) that differed by a single heteroatom near the ZA channel. The 2-furan SJ830599, the most BD2-selective THQ analog, did not disrupt the water-mediated networks in either domain, but was electrostatically-repulsed by the specific arrangement of the W5 water dipole in BD1. Our work underscores the value of exploring water-mediated interactions to study ligand binding, and highlights the difficulty of optimizing polar interactions due to high desolvation penalties. Finally, we suggest further modifications to THQ-based BET inhibitors that would increase BD2-selectivity in BRD2-4, while minimizing affinity for one or both bromodomains of BRDT."
"Stroke patients are at increased risk for recurrent stroke and development of post-stroke dementia. In this study, we investigated the effects of recurrent stroke on adult brain neurogenesis using a novel rat model of recurrent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) developed in our laboratory. Using BrdU incorporation, activation and depletion of stem cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ) were assessed in control rats and rats after one or two strokes. In vitro neurosphere assay was used to assess the effects of plasma from normal and stroke rats. Also, EM and permeability studies were used to evaluate changes in the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) of the SGZ after recurrent stroke. We found that proliferation and neurogenesis was activated 14?days after MCAO. This was correlated with increased permeability in the BBB to factors which increase proliferation in a neurosphere assay. However, with each stroke, there was a stepwise decrease of proliferating stem cells and impaired neurogenesis on the ipsilateral side. On the contralateral side, this process stabilized after a first stroke. These studies indicate that stem cells are activated after MCAO, possibly after increased access to systemic stroke-related factors through a leaky BBB. However, the recruitment of stem cells for neurogenesis after stroke results in a stepwise ipsilateral decline with each ischemic event, which could contribute to post-stroke dementia."
"To determine the prevalence and experience of migraines in adolescents with surgically confirmed endometriosis compared with those without endometriosis.Cross-sectional study conducted within The Women's Health Study: From Adolescence to Adulthood-an ongoing longitudinal cohort.Boston Center for Endometriosis.Adolescent females enrolled November 2012 through November 2016. The case group included adolescents surgically diagnosed with endometriosis. The control group included adolescents without endometriosis, recruited from the local community and clinics.Not available.An extensive online health questionnaire regarding medical history, lifestyle, medication use, anthropometrics, and symptom experience and treatments. Migraine diagnosis was self-reported. Migraine pain and noncyclic pelvic pain severity were rated using an 11-point numerical rating scale. Cyclic pelvic pain was categorized.Adolescents with endometriosis were more likely to experience migraines (69.3%) than those without endometriosis (30.7%) (multivariable odds ratio = 4.77, 95% confidence interval 2.53, 9.02). For each 1-point increase in the migraine numerical rating scale, the odds of endometriosis increased by 22% (multivariable odds ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.03, 1.44; Ptrend= .02). Among those with endometriosis, age of menarche was associated inversely with the odds of migraines. Participants with endometriosis and migraines have more dysmenorrhea than those without migraines.Adolescents with endometriosis are more likely to experience migraines than adolescents without endometriosis. A linear relationship exists between migraine pain severity and the odds of endometriosis, suggesting heightened pain sensitivity for adolescents with endometriosis. Due to the strong correlation, patients who present with either condition should be screened for comorbidity to maximize the benefits of care."
"Reliance on online health information is proliferating and the Internet has the potential to revolutionize the provision of public health information. The anonymity of online health information may be particularly appealing to people seeking advice on 'embarrassing' health problems. The purpose of this study was to investigate (1) whether data generated by the embarrassingproblems.com health information site showed any temporal patterns in problem resolution, and (2) whether successful resolution of a medical problem using online information varied with the type of medical problem.We analyzed the responses of visitors to the embarrassingproblems.com website on the resolution of their problems. The dataset comprised 100,561 responses to information provided on 77 different embarrassing problems grouped into 9 classes of medical problem over an 82-month period. Data were analyzed with a Bernoulli Generalized Linear Model using Bayesian inference.We detected a statistically important interaction between embarrassing problem type and the time period in which data were collected, with an improvement in problem resolution over time for all of the classes of medical problem on the website but with a lower rate of increase in resolution for urinary health problems and medical problems associated with the mouth and face. As far as we are aware, this is the first analysis of data of this nature.Findings support the growing recognition that online health information can contribute to the resolution of embarrassing medical problems, but demonstrate that outcomes may vary with medical problem type. The results indicate that building data collection into online information provision can help to refine and focus health information for online users."
"Apolipoprotein E (APOE)-?4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. However, the dose-dependent impact of this allele on brain morphology of healthy individuals remains unclear.We analyzed gray matter volumes (GMvs) in a sample of 533 healthy middle-aged individuals with a substantial representation of ?4-carriers (207 heterozygotes and 65 homozygotes).We found APOE-?4 additive GMv reductions in the right hippocampus, caudate, precentral gyrus, and cerebellar crus. In these regions, the APOE genotype interacted with age, with homozygotes displaying lower GMv after the fifth decade of life. APOE-?4 was also associated to greater GMv in the right thalamus, left occipital gyrus, and right frontal cortex.Our data indicate that APOE-?4 exerts additive effects on GMv in regions relevant for Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology already in healthy individuals. These findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increased Alzheimer's disease risk in ?4-carriers, suggesting a dose-dependent disease vulnerability on the brain structure level."
"Recent studies have confirmed the utility of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), providing a remarkable opportunity to find variants in known disease genes, especially in genetically heterogeneous disorders such as hearing loss (HL).After excluding mutations in the most common autosomal recessive non-syndromic HL (ARNSHL) genes via Sanger sequencing and genetic linkage analysis, we performed NGS in the proband an Iranian family with ARNSHL. The NimbleGen sequence capture array captures codingsequences (CDSs) and 100 bp of the flanking sequence of 129 common deafness genes (cat# Oto-DA3). NGSwas performed on the IlluminaHiSeq2000. BWA, SAMtools, Picard, GATK, Variant Tools, ANNOVAR, and IGV were applied for Bioinformatics analyses. Data filtering with allele frequencies (<5% in the 1000 Genomes Project and 5400 NHLBI exomes) and PolyPhen2/SIFTscores (>0.95) prioritized 1indel (insertions/deletions) and 3 missense variants in this family. Eventually, Sanger sequencing, segregation pattern, the frequency in 50 healthy matched normal controls, and evolutionary conservation of amino acid residues revealed the pathogenic variant.We identified a novel missenseGIPC3 mutation, c.472G?>?A (p.Glu158 Lys). The pathogenicity of GIPC3c.472G?>?A was supported by its absence in the population databases and the healthy-matched controls.Sanger sequencing confirmed co-segregation of the mutation with HL.This study is the first report of the contribution of theGIPC3 gene to HL in the Iranian population.Targeted NGS allows easier detection of mutations in relatively uncommon deafness genes in families with ARNSHL."
"To evaluate facial asymmetry changes in pre-school patients with orofacial clefts after neonatal cheiloplasty and to compare facial asymmetry with age-matched healthy controls.The sample consisted of patients with unilateral cleft lip (UCL), unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), and bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP). The patients were divided in two age groups with a mean age of 3 years (n?=?51) and 4.5 years (n?=?45), respectively, and 78 age-matched individuals as controls. Three-dimensional (3D) facial scans were analyzed using geometric morphometry and multivariate statistics.Geometric morphometry showed positive deviations from perfect symmetry on the right side of the forehead in the intervention groups and the controls. The UCL groups showed the greatest asymmetric nasolabial area on the cleft-side labia and the contralateral nasal tip. The UCLP group showed, moreover, asymmetry in buccal region due to typical maxillar hypoplasia, which was accentuated in the older group. The BCLP groups showed slightly similar but greater asymmetry than the control groups, except for the philtrum region.Asymmetry of each of the cleft groups significantly differed from the controls. Except for the buccal region in the UCLP and BCLP groups, asymmetry did not significantly increase with age."
"Oxidative stress contributes to cell injury and aggravates several chronic diseases. Dietary antioxidants help the body to fight against free radicals and, therefore, avoid or reduce oxidative stress. Recently, proteins from milk whey liquid have been described as antioxidants. This review summarizes the evidence that whey products exhibit radical scavenging activity and reducing power. It examines the processing and treatment attempts to increase the antioxidant bioactivity and identifies 1 enzyme, subtilisin, which consistently produces the most potent whey fractions. The review compares whey from different milk sources and puts whey proteins in the context of other known food antioxidants. However, for efficacy, the antioxidant activity of whey proteins must not only survive processing, but also upper gut transit and arrival in the bloodstream, if whey products are to promote antioxidant levels in target organs. Studies reveal that direct cell exposure to whey samples increases intracellular antioxidants such as glutathione. However, the physiological relevance of these in vitro assays is questionable, and evidence is conflicting from dietary intervention trials, with both rats and humans, that whey products can boost cellular antioxidant biomarkers."
"Increasing the dietary fat content of ruminant diets decreases methane (CH4) production. This effect is caused by the toxic properties of fatty acids on rumen microbial populations, coating of feed particles diminishing the accessibility for microbes, and a reduction in dry matter intake (DMI). The latter effect is caused by postabsorptive long-chain fatty acids eliciting anorexic signaling; however, whether circulating long-chain fatty acids affect rumen CH4production alike is unknown. To approach this question, 5 rumen-cannulated Holstein cows in late lactation received 2 jugular catheters and were kept in respiration chambers to measure CH4production and DMI for 48 h. In a crossover design, cows were intravenously infused with a 20% lipid emulsion (LIPO) or 0.9% NaCl (CON). The LIPO cows received 2.1 kg of triglycerides/d [0.152 ± 0.007 g of triglycerides/(kg of BW × h)-1] consisting of 12.1% palmitic acid, 4.2% stearic acid, 31.1% oleic acid, and 52.7% linoleic acid. Blood and rumen fluid samples were taken hourly during the day. Results showed that LIPO compared with CON infusion increased plasma triglyceride as well as free fatty acid and serotonin concentrations but reduced the proportion of de novo synthesized milk fatty acids (sum of C6 to C16). Daily CH4production and DMI were lower, whereas daily CH4yield (CH4/DMI) was greater in LIPO than CON cows, although CH4yield decreased from d 1 to d 2 by 2 to 14% in LIPO-infused cows only. This effect was associated with a higher (acetate + butyrate)/propionate ratio, tending lower propionate concentrations between 24 and 34 h of infusion, reduced relative abundances of genera belonging to Succinivibrio, Ruminococcaceae, and Ruminiclostridium, and greater relative Bacteroidetes genus abundances in the rumen."
"Low molecular weight antimicrobial polypeptides were extracted and purified from the young fresh leaves of Azadirachta indica (neem). The total protein extracted was precipitated with 15% TCA-Acetone. The total purified proteins yielded from the two extraction methods were 122.33?±?2.21 and 115.09?±?1.88?mg/g of the total fresh weight. The SDS-PAGE analysis identified the presence of eight low molecular weight polypeptide bands. The antimicrobial activity of the resolved bands was detected by Polyacrylamide gel-Agar overlay diffusion assay (PAG-ADA). Their broad-spectrum bactericidal activity was confirmed using the same technique and found three low molecular weight bands from 11 to 14?kDa collectively exhibiting superior bactericidal activities against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungicidal activity against Candida tropicalis. The FTIR spectrum of the protein bands depicted the presence of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in the protein bands. These polypeptides were characterized by MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis. Further, the purified protein extract was found to be active against HELA, BT-549 and Neuro-2a cell lines with IC50value of 74.03?±?2.31, 64.82?±?1.64, 238.32?±?2.12 and 109.94?±?2.96, 59.61?±?0.75 for 24?h and 48?h, respectively. The results of present study indicate that these polypeptides exhibit broad spectrum antimicrobial and anticancer activity and can therefore be explored for their therapeutic potential."
"An increasing number of intensive care patients are surviving critical illness, but many develop mental, cognitive and physical impairments after discharge. Adapting to a new life situation, often with major challenges, implies the need of support. Therefore, it is important to develop interventions aimed at promoting recovery.The aim was to describe former intensive care patients' feelings of sharing their experience of critical illness with other former patients.Former intensive care patients (n?=?17) participated in group meetings and wrote about their thoughts in a notebook after each group meeting. To deepen the understanding of the former patients' experience 11 of the former patients were interviewed. The notes in the notebooks and the interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis.Meeting others revealed to the former patients new dimensions of being critically ill, and they both gave and received strength from each other. The meetings were meaningful as they gained insight into other patients' lives, and realised what it meant to survive intensive care.The group meetings meant sharing experiences and understanding the process of survival after critical illness. Giving and receiving strength from others helped the participants to go further."
"Tissues are maintained by adult stem cells that self-renew and also differentiate into functioning tissue cells. Homeostasis is achieved by a set of complex mechanisms that involve regulatory feedback loops. Similarly, tumors are believed to be maintained by a minority population of cancer stem cells, while the bulk of the tumor is made up of more differentiated cells, and there is indication that some of the feedback loops that operate in tissues continue to be functional in tumors. Mathematical models of such tissue hierarchies, including feedback loops, have been analyzed in a variety of different contexts. Apart from stem cells giving rise to differentiated cells, it has also been observed that more differentiated cells can de-differentiate into stem cells, both in healthy tissue and tumors, aspects of which have also been investigated mathematically. This paper analyses the effect of de-differentiation on the basic and evolutionary dynamics of cells in the context of tissue hierarchy models that include negative feedback regulation of the cell populations. The models predict that in the presence of de-differentiation, the fixation probability of a neutral mutant is lower than in its absence. Therefore, if de-differentiation occurs, a mutant with identical parameters compared to the wild-type cell population behaves like a disadvantageous mutant. Similarly, the process of de-differentiation is found to lower the fixation probability of an advantageous mutant. These results indicate that the presence of de-differentiation can lower the rates of tumor initiation and progression in the context of the models considered here."
"Interstitial lung abnormality (ILA) is found in 5-10% of the general population and is associated with increased mortality risk. Risk factors for ILA, including advanced age and smoking history also increase the risk for aortic stenosis (AS). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become an increasingly utilized intervention for patients with severe AS, and requires a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest to assess aortic valve dimensions.To determine the prevalence and clinical significance of ILA on HRCT performed in patients referred for TAVR.Consecutive pre-TAVR HRCTs performed over a 5-year period were reviewed. ILA was defined as bilateral, nondependent reticular opacities. All-cause mortality among TAVR recipients was compared between ILA cases and non-ILA controls matched 2:1 by age and gender using Cox proportional hazards regression and the Kaplan Meier estimator.Of 623 HRCTs screened, ILA was detected in 92 (14.7%), including 62 patients that underwent TAVR. Among ILA cases, 17 (27.4%) had a typical or probable usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, suggesting a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Survival was worse in ILA cases compared to non-ILA controls (p?=?0.008) and ILA was an independent predictor of mortality after multivariable adjustment (HR 3.29, 95% CI 1.34-8.08; p?=?0.009).ILA is a common finding among patients with severe AS and is associated with increased mortality in those undergoing TAVR. Further research is needed to elucidate the biology underpinning this observation and determine whether ILA evaluation and risk stratification modulates this mortality risk."
"The advent of mass cytometry increased the number of parameters measured at the single-cell level while decreasing the extent of crosstalk between channels relative to dye-based flow cytometry. Although reduced, spillover still exists in mass cytometry data, and minimizing its effect requires considerable expert knowledge and substantial experimental effort. Here, we describe a novel bead-based compensation workflow and R-based software that estimates and corrects for interference between channels. We performed an in-depth characterization of the spillover properties in mass cytometry, including limitations defined by the linear range of the mass cytometer and the reproducibility of the spillover over time and across machines. We demonstrated the utility of our method in suspension and imaging mass cytometry. To conclude, our approach greatly simplifies the development of new antibody panels, increases flexibility for antibody-metal pairing, opens the way to using less pure isotopes, and improves overall data quality, thereby reducing the risk of reporting cell phenotype artifacts."
"Gene networks are rapidly growing in size and number, raising the question of which networks are most appropriate for particular applications. Here, we evaluate 21 human genome-wide interaction networks for their ability to recover 446 disease gene sets identified through literature curation, gene expression profiling, or genome-wide association studies. While all networks have some ability to recover disease genes, we observe a wide range of performance with STRING, ConsensusPathDB, and GIANT networks having the best performance overall. A general tendency is that performance scales with network size, suggesting that new interaction discovery currently outweighs the detrimental effects of false positives. Correcting for size, we find that the DIP network provides the highest efficiency (value per interaction). Based on these results, we create a parsimonious composite network with both high efficiency and performance. This work provides a benchmark for selection of molecular networks in human disease research."
"Paralogous transcription factors (TFs) are oftentimes reported to have identical DNA-binding motifs, despite the fact that they perform distinct regulatory functions. Differential genomic targeting by paralogous TFs is generally assumed to be due to interactions with protein co-factors or the chromatin environment. Using a computational-experimental framework called iMADS (integrative modeling and analysis of differential specificity), we show that, contrary to previous assumptions, paralogous TFs bind differently to genomic target sites even in vitro. We used iMADS to quantify, model, and analyze specificity differences between 11 TFs from 4 protein families. We found that paralogous TFs have diverged mainly at medium- and low-affinity sites, which are poorly captured by current motif models. We identify sequence and shape features differentially preferred by paralogous TFs, and we show that the intrinsic differences in specificity among paralogous TFs contribute to their differential in vivo binding. Thus, our study represents a step forward in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of differential specificity in TF families."
"Previously, we have studied protein adsorption and chromatographic behaviors on poly(ethylenimine) (PEI)-grafted Sepharose FF anion-exchange resins, and found that protein uptake rates increased greatly when PEI grafting density reached over a critical ionic capacity (cIC) due to the occurrence of the ""chain delivery"" effect. Moreover, by partial charge neutralization of starting resin FF-PEI-L740 (IC?=?740?mmol/L, larger than the cIC) with sodium acetate to FF-PEI-R440, it exhibited a three-fold increase in uptake rate over FF-PEI-L740. In this work, to take the advantages of PEI and extend the applications of the PEI-grafted resins in cation-exchange chromatography, a series of cation exchangers of five different ICs were developed. First, the charged of FF-PEI-L740 was reversed from positive to negative by reaction with excess succinic anhydride, which created a cation-exchanger with an IC of 970?mmol/L (FF-FEI-C970). FF-PEI-C970 was further modified with ethanolamine for partial charge neutralizations, leading to the preparation of four charge-reduced cation exchangers with IC values (in?mmol/L) of 780, 630, 560 and 430, which were denoted as FF-PEI-CR780, -CR630 -CR560 and -CR430, respectively. Protein adsorption and chromatographic behaviors were investigated using lysozyme (Lys) as the model protein. It was found that, the resins of high and moderate IC values (IC???560?mmol/L) afforded adsorption capacities up to over 230?mg/mL. Besides, the uptake rate, represented by the effective pore diffusivity (De/D0), exhibited significant increase from 0.067 (FF-PEI-C970 and FF-PEI-CR780) to 0.343 (FF-PEI-CR630 and FF-PEI-CR560) and then to 1.035 (FF-PEI-CR430) with decreasing IC. It was considered that decreasing IC led to the decreased protein binding sites (binding strength), which encouraged the occurrence of the ""chain delivery"" effect. Moreover, the resins of high and moderate IC values, particularly, the resins of moderate IC values (FF-PEI-CR630 and FF-PEI-CR560), presented both high adsorption capacities and uptake kinetics at 0-100?mmol/L NaCl. Besides, dynamic binding capacity achieved 150?mg/mL for the resins of moderate IC values at 0?mmol/L NaCl concentration, and afforded >110?mg/mL for the resin of high IC values at 0-100?mmol/L NaCl concentration. The results proved the excellent IEC performance of the PEI-derived cation exchangers."
"This review summarizes current research in sperm mitochondrial function with specific emphasis on mitochondrial metabolism, reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial genomics. This organelle is key in many crucial sperm functions including motility, hyperactivation, capacitation, acrosome reaction, and fertilization, thus its role in male fertility cannot be ignored. Recent studies have further elucidated sperm metabolism, placing greater emphasis on the importance of mitochondrial energy production for some species. Additionally, the dogma of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production is changing and is being described by some as an indicator of increased mitochondrial function, potentially representing the most fertile sperm. Further, the mitochondrial genome, specifically mitochondrial DNA copy number, has been indicated as a potential biomarker for sperm quality and fertility in several species. Methods to study the sperm mitochondria are also evolving, allowing for researchers to learn more about the bioenergetics and status of this important organelle. Because of the importance of mitochondrial function for sperm function in most species, it is crucial to better understand the mechanisms involved in order to improve our knowledge of sperm physiology as well as improve handling and storage techniques for the industry."
"The sensitivity and specificity are two crucial aspects of addressing the efficacy of diagnostic antigens. Achilles' heel of low sensitivity rate exists in current diagnostic recombinant antigens for schistosomiasis detection. This study focused on the diagnosis of water buffalo schistosomiasis japonica and a perspective of improving recombinant antigens' sensitivity was assessed using archived 220 water buffalo sera (114 positive sera, 92 negative sera and 14 Paramphistomum-infected sera) and the method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The subjects included two trivalent recombinant proteins, one bivalent antigen and two single-molecular antigens. The crude antigen SEA (soluble egg antigen) was employed as reference antigen. The highest sensitivity rate in the five recombinant antigens assigned to the trivalent multi-epitope antigen PA4 (95.61%, 109/114), no significant difference with SEA (100%, 114/114, p?=?.836), and showing remarkable differences with the two single-molecular antigens (p?<?0.01). In term of specificity, two trivalent multi-epitope antigens PA4 (97.83%, 90/92), PA5 (100%, 92/92) and the bivalent antigen PA3 (98.91%, 91/92) had few differences with one monovalent antigens PA1 (97.83%, 90/92, p?=?.304/0.103/0.640), significant differences with another monovalent antigens PA2 (92.39%, 85/92, p?<?0.01) and SEA (82.61%, 76/92, p?<?0.01). Additional, all the recombinant antigens had low cross-reactivity (7.14%, 1/14, 0% for PA5) with serum samples of paramphistomiasis, contrast with that of SEA (50%, 7/14, p?<?0.01). The results indicated that multi-epitope antigens have the possibility to improve diagnostic sensitivity and the trivalent multi-epitope antigen PA4 possesses greater likelihood to be a diagnostic antigen for water buffalo schistosomiasis."
"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease with variable outcomes. Despite the majority of patients being cured with combination chemoimmunotherapy, up to 30% eventually succumb to the disease. Until recently, baseline prognostic assessment has centred on the International Prognostic Index (IPI), although this index is yet to impact strongly on treatment choice. Molecular features such as cell of origin, MYC and BCL-2 genetic alterations and protein overexpression were identified over a decade ago, yet their prognostic value is still not fully elucidated. Adding complexity are the plethora of new clinical, biological and molecular prognostic markers described in the recent literature, most of which lack independent validation, likely act as surrogate markers for those already in common use and have yet to substantially impact on therapeutic decision making. This review comprehensively assesses the value of individual prognostic markers in the clinical setting and their potential to predict response to novel agents, and ways to optimise their use in future research."
"A quality assurance (QA) program is a valuable tool for the continuous production of optimal quality images. The aim of this paper is to assess a newly developed automatic computer software for image quality (IR) evaluation in fluoroscopy X-ray systems.Test object images were acquired using one fluoroscopy system, Siemens Axiom Artis model (Siemens AG, Medical Solutions Erlangen, Germany). The software was developed as an ImageJ plugin. Two image quality parameters were assessed: high-contrast spatial resolution (HCSR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The time between manual and automatic image quality assessment procedures were compared. The paired t-test was used to assess the data. p Values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.The Fluoro-QC software generated faster IQ evaluation results (mean = 0.31 ± 0.08 min) than manual procedure (mean = 4.68 ± 0.09 min). The mean difference between techniques was 4.36 min. Discrepancies were identified in the region of interest (ROI) areas drawn manually with evidence of user dependence. The new software presented the results of two tests (HCSR = 3.06, SNR = 5.17) and also collected information from the DICOM header. Significant differences were not identified between manual and automatic measures of SNR (p value = 0.22) and HCRS (p value = 0.46).The Fluoro-QC software is a feasible, fast and free to use method for evaluating imaging quality parameters on fluoroscopy systems."
"Foundational to trait-based community ecology is the expectation that functional traits determine demographic outcomes. However, trait-demographic rate relationships are frequently weak, particularly in tree communities. The foundation of trait-based tree community ecology may, therefore, appear to be unstable. Here we argue that there are three core reasons why trait-demographic relationships are generally weak in tree communities. Specifically, important contextual information is frequently ignored, there is too much focus on species relative to individuals, and there are dimensions of tree function that are critical for determining tree demographic rates that are not captured by easily measured functional traits. Rather than being evidence that trait-based community ecology is fundamentally flawed, these issues elucidate a pathway towards a more robust research program."
"Liver regeneration after simple resection represents a unique process in which the organ returns to its original size and histologic structure. Over the past 30 years, there has been significant progress in elucidating the mechanisms associated with regeneration after loss of hepatic mass. Liver regeneration after acute liver failure shares several of these classical pathways. It differs, however, in key processes, including the role of both differentiated and stemlike cells. This article outlines these differences in addition to new molecular mechanisms, including immunomodulation, microRNAs, and the gut-liver axis. In addition, applications to the patient population, including prognostication and stem cell therapies, are explored."
"It is difficult to study the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) in living patients because central nervous system (CNS) tissues are only available post mortem. Rodent and nonhuman primate (NHP) models of HAND allow for longitudinal analysis of HIV-associated CNS pathology and efficacy studies of novel therapeutics. Rodent models of HAND allow for studies with large sample sizes, short duration, and relatively low cost. These models include humanized mice used to study HIV-associated neuropathogenesis and transgenic mice used to study neurotoxic effects of viral proteins without infection. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected NHP are the premier model of neuroAIDS; SIV-associated CNS pathology is similar to HIV-associated CNS pathology with HAND. Additionally, the size, lifespan of NHP, and time to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression make SIV-infected NHP models optimal for studies of viral latency and reservoirs, and assessing novel therapeutics for neuroAIDS. NHP models of neuroAIDS generally include conventional progressors (AIDS within 2-3 years) and those that have rapid disease (AIDS within 150 days). Rapid AIDS models are achieved by immune modulation and/or infection with neurovirulent and neurosuppressive viral strains and result in a high incidence of SIV-associated encephalitis. In this chapter, we briefly review rodent and NHP models of neuroAIDS, including contributions made using these models to our understanding of HIV-associated CNS disease."
"We analyzed the antiproliferative activity of 6 medicinal wood-destroying mushrooms (Fomes fomentarius, Fomitopsis pinicola, Trametes versicolor, Trichaptum biforme, Inonotus obliquus, and Coniophora puteana) that are common in deciduous and mixed coniferous forests in Central Russia. Morphological identification of strains collected from the wild was confirmed based on ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer phylogenetic analysis. We observed cytotoxic and cell growth-inhibitory effects of hot water extracts from mycelial biomass of 5 species-T. versicolor, C. puteana, F. fomentarius, F. pinicola, and I. obliquus-on leukemia cell lines (Jukart, K562, and THP-1); the effective extract concentrations were mostly less than 50 ?g · mL-1. However, we observed no antiproliferative activity of dry biomass from methanol-chloroform (1:1) extracts of C. puteana and F. fomentarius. A chemosensitivity assay showed that the most effective polypore mushroom extract was the methanol extract of T. versicolor (strain It-1), which inhibited the growth of 6 various solid tumors (A-549 and SWi573 [lung], HBL-100 and T-47D [breast], HeLa [cervix], and WiDr [colon]) at concentrations below 45 ?g · mL-1, with a concentration as low as 0.7-3.6 ?g · mL-1 causing 50% reduction in the proliferation of cancer cells in lung and cervix tumors. Methanol extracts of F. pinicola and I. obliquus were less effective, with proliferation-inhibiting capacities at concentrations below 70 and 200 ?g · mL-1, respectively. Thus, T. versicolor is a prospective candidate in the search for and production of new antiproliferative chemical compounds."
"?-Synuclein (?-syn) is the major component of the intraneuronal inclusions called Lewy bodies, which are the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. ?-Syn is capable of self-assembly into many different species, such as soluble oligomers and fibrils. Even though attempts to resolve the structures of the protein have been made, detailed understanding about the structures and their relationship with the different aggregation steps is lacking, which is of interest to provide insights into the pathogenic mechanism of Parkinson's disease. Here we report the structural flexibility of ?-syn monomers and dimers in an aqueous solution environment as probed by single-molecule time-lapse high-speed AFM. In addition, we present the molecular basis for the structural transitions using discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations. ?-Syn monomers assume a globular conformation, which is capable of forming tail-like protrusions over dozens of seconds. Importantly, a globular monomer can adopt fully extended conformations. Dimers, on the other hand, are less dynamic and show a dumbbell conformation that experiences morphological changes over time. DMD simulations revealed that the ?-syn monomer consists of several tightly packed small helices. The tail-like protrusions are also helical with a small ?-sheet, acting as a ""hinge"". Monomers within dimers have a large interfacial interaction area and are stabilized by interactions in the non-amyloid central (NAC) regions. Furthermore, the dimer NAC-region of each ?-syn monomer forms a ?-rich segment. Moreover, NAC-regions are located in the hydrophobic core of the dimer."
"Internal friction is frequently found in protein dynamics. Its molecular origin however is difficult to conceptualize. Even unfolded and intrinsically disordered polypeptide chains exhibit signs of internal friction despite their enormous solvent accessibility. Here, we compare four polymer theories of internal friction with experimental results on the intrinsically disordered protein ACTR (activator of thyroid hormone receptor). Using nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy combined with single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), we determine the time scales of the diffusive chain dynamics of ACTR at different solvent viscosities and varying degrees of compaction. Despite pronounced differences between the theories, we find that all models can capture the experimental viscosity-dependence of the chain relaxation time. In contrast, the observed slowdown upon chain collapse of ACTR is not captured by any of the theories and a mechanistic link between chain dimension and internal friction is still missing, implying that the current theories are incomplete. In addition, a discrepancy between early results on homopolymer solutions and recent single-molecule experiments on unfolded and disordered proteins suggests that internal friction is likely to be a composite phenomenon caused by a variety of processes."
"Gastrulation is a fundamental phase during the biological development of most animals when a single layer of identical embryo cells is transformed into a three-layer structure, from which the organs start to develop. Despite a remarkable progress in quantifying the gastrulation processes, molecular mechanisms of these processes remain not well understood. Here we theoretically investigate early spatial patterning in a geometrically confined colony of embryonic stem cells. Using a reaction-diffusion model, a role of Bone-Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) signaling pathway in gastrulation is specifically analyzed. Our results show that for slow diffusion rates of BMP4 molecules, a new length scale appears, which is independent of the size of the system. This length scale separates the central region of the colony with uniform low concentrations of BMP molecules from the region near the colony edge where the concentration of signaling molecules is elevated. The roles of different components of the signaling pathway are also explained. Theoretical results are consistent with recent in vitro experiments, providing microscopic explanations for some features of early embryonic spatial patterning. Physical-chemical mechanisms of these processes are discussed."
"Nucleosomes consisting of a short piece of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins form the fundamental unit of chromatin in eukaryotes. Their role in DNA compaction comes with regulatory functions that impact essential genomic processes such as replication, transcription, and repair. The assembly of nucleosomes obeys a precise pathway in which tetramers of histones H3 and H4 bind to the DNA first to form tetrasomes, and two dimers of histones H2A and H2B are subsequently incorporated to complete the complex. As viable intermediates, we previously showed that tetrasomes can spontaneously flip between a left-handed and right-handed conformation of DNA-wrapping. To pinpoint the underlying mechanism, here we investigated the role of the H3-H3 interface for tetramer flexibility in the flipping process at the single-molecule level. Using freely orbiting magnetic tweezers, we studied the assembly and structural dynamics of individual tetrasomes modified at the cysteines close to this interaction interface by iodoacetamide (IA) in real time. While such modification did not affect the structural properties of the tetrasomes, it caused a 3-fold change in their flipping kinetics. The results indicate that the IA-modification enhances the conformational plasticity of tetrasomes. Our findings suggest that subnucleosomal dynamics may be employed by chromatin as an intrinsic and adjustable mechanism to regulate DNA supercoiling."
"Bio-macromolecules carry out complicated functions through structural changes. To understand their mechanism of action, the structure of each step has to be characterized. While classical structural biology techniques allow the characterization of a few ""structural snapshots"" along the enzymatic cycle (usually of stable conformations), they do not cover all (and often fast interconverting) structures in the ensemble, where each may play an important functional role. Recently, several groups have demonstrated that structures of different conformations in solution could be solved by measuring multiple distances between different pairs of residues using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and using them as constrains for hybrid/integrative structural modeling. However, this approach is limited in cases where the conformational dynamics is faster than the technique's temporal resolution. In this study, we combine existing tools that elucidate sub-millisecond conformational dynamics together with hybrid/integrative structural modeling to study the conformational states of the transcription bubble in the bacterial RNA polymerase-promoter open complex (RPo). We measured microsecond alternating laser excitation-smFRET of differently labeled lacCONS promoter dsDNA constructs. We used a combination of burst variance analysis, photon-by-photon hidden Markov modeling, and the FRET-restrained positioning and screening approach to identify two conformational states for RPo. The experimentally derived distances of one conformational state match the known crystal structure of bacterial RPo. The experimentally derived distances of the other conformational state have characteristics of a scrunched RPo. These findings support the hypothesis that sub-millisecond dynamics in the transcription bubble are responsible for transcription start site selection."
"We describe an optical near shot-noise limited time-resolved circular dichroism (TRCD) pump-probe spectrometer capable of reliably measuring circular dichroism signals in the order of ?deg with nanosecond time resolution. Such sensitivity is achieved through a modification of existing TRCD designs and introduction of a new data processing protocol that eliminates approximations that have caused substantial nonlinearities in past measurements and allows the measurement of absorption and circular dichroism transients simultaneously with a single pump pulse. The exceptional signal-to-noise ratio of the described setup makes the TRCD technique applicable to a large range of non-biological and biological systems. The spectrometer was used to record, for the first time, weak TRCD kinetics associated with the triplet state energy transfer in the photosynthetic Fenna-Matthews-Olson antenna pigment-protein complex."
"Over time, a bird population's acoustic and morphological features can diverge from the parent species. A quantitative measure of difference between two populations of species/subspecies is extremely useful to zoologists. Work in this paper takes a dialect difference system first developed for speech and refines it to automatically measure vocalisation difference between bird populations by extracting pitch contours. The pitch contours are transposed into pitch codes. A variety of codebook schemes are proposed to represent the contour structure, including a vector quantization approach. The measure, called Bird Vocalisation Difference, is applied to bird populations with calls that are considered very similar, very different, and between these two extremes. Initial results are very promising, with the behaviour of the metric consistent with accepted levels of similarity for the populations tested to date. The influence of data size on the measure is investigated by using reduced datasets. Results of species pair classification using Gaussian mixture models with Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients is also given as a baseline indicator of class confusability."
"Finding the correct encoding for a generic dynamical system's trajectory is a complicated task: the symbolic sequence needs to preserve the invariant properties from the system's trajectory. In theory, the solution to this problem is found when a Generating Markov Partition (GMP) is obtained, which is only defined once the unstable and stable manifolds are known with infinite precision and for all times. However, these manifolds usually form highly convoluted Euclidean sets, are a priori unknown, and, as it happens in any real-world experiment, measurements are made with finite resolution and over a finite time-span. The task gets even more complicated if the system is a network composed of interacting dynamical units, namely, a high-dimensional complex system. Here, we tackle this task and solve it by defining a method to approximately construct GMPs for any complex system's finite-resolution and finite-time trajectory. We critically test our method on networks of coupled maps, encoding their trajectories into symbolic sequences. We show that these sequences are optimal because they minimise the information loss and also any spurious information added. Consequently, our method allows us to approximately calculate the invariant probability measures of complex systems from the observed data. Thus, we can efficiently define complexity measures that are applicable to a wide range of complex phenomena, such as the characterisation of brain activity from electroencephalogram signals measured at different brain regions or the characterisation of climate variability from temperature anomalies measured at different Earth regions."
"Multistability refers to the coexistence of different stable states in nonlinear dynamical systems. This phenomenon has been observed in laboratory experiments and in nature. In this introduction, we briefly introduce the classes of dynamical systems in which this phenomenon has been found and discuss the extension to new system classes. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of critical transitions and discuss approaches to distinguish them according to their characteristics. Finally, we present some specific applications in physics, neuroscience, biology, ecology, and climate science."
"Information on drug transfer into the breast milk is essential to protect the infant from undesirable adverse effects of maternal consumption of drugs and to allow effective pharmacological treatment of breastfeeding mothers. Metronidazole and fluconazole are two drugs frequently used in nursing women to treat various infections, thus questioning infant's safety due to drug exposure through breast milk. In this article a porous graphitized carbon LC/ESI-MS assay was developed for the quantitation of metronidazole and fluconazole in breast milk and human plasma. The assay was based on the use of 150??L of biological samples, following acetonitrile precipitation of proteins and filtration that enabled injection into the LC/ESI-MS system. All analytes and the internal standard, ropinirole, were separated by using a porous graphitized carbon analytical column (150?×?2.1?mm i.d., particle size 5??m) with isocratic elution. The mobile phase consists of 55% acetonitrile in water acidified with 0.1% concentrated formic acid and pumped at a flow rate of 0.25?mL?min-1. The assay was linear over a concentration range of 0.1 to 15??g?mL-1for all analytes in both biological samples. Intermediate precision was found to be <8.4% over the tested concentration ranges. A run time of <5?min for each sample made it possible to analyze a large number of biological samples per day. The method is the first reported application for the analysis of metronidazole and fluconazole in both breast milk and human plasma and it can be used to support a wide range of clinical studies."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most frequent and severe form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. The pathogenesis is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cinnamaldehyde exhibits antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties, but its effect on IPF is unknown. The present study is to investigate the anti-fibrotic effect and action mechanism of cinnamaldehyde on IPF.IPF was induced by intratracheal bleomycin in mice. Submicron emulsion of cinnamaldehyde was given by intraperitoneal injection once everyday for 7 or 21 continuous days after bleomycin administration. Lung histological and injury indexes were analyzed. The protein expressions of inflammation and oxidative stress as well as EMT markers alpha-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) and E-cadherin in mice and cultured A549 cells were measured.Cinnamaldehyde attenuated the bleomycin-induced histological injury, reduced hydroxyproline level and improved pulmonary function by the inhibiting inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species production as well as enhancing total superoxide dismutase activity in bleomycin-induced mice. Cinnamaldehyde also inhibited EMT in both bleomycin-induced mice and TGF-?1-stimulated A549 cells.Cinnamaldehyde ameliorated bleomycin-induced IPF via inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress and EMT."
"The dedifferentiation, proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are essential in the progression of hypertension, atherosclerosis and intimal hyperplasia. Nesfatin-1 is a potential modulator in cardiovascular functions. However, the role of nesfatin-1 in VSMC biology has not been explored. The present study was designed to determine the regulatory role of nesfatin-1 in VSMC proliferation, migration and intimal hyperplasia after vascular injury. Herein, we demonstrated that nesfatin-1 promoted VSMC phenotype switch from a contractile to a synthetic state, stimulated VSMC proliferation and migration in vitro. At the molecular level, nesfatin-1 upregulated the protein and mRNA levels, as well as the promoter activities of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9, but downregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?) levels and promoter activity in VSMCs. Blockade of MMP-2/9 or activation of PPAR? prevented the nesfatin-1-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. In vivo, knockdown of nesfatin-1 ameliorated neointima formation following rat carotid injury. Taken together, our results indicated that nesfatin-1 stimulated VSMC proliferation, migration and neointimal hyperplasia by elevating MMP2/MMP-9 levels and inhibiting PPAR? gene expression."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The oncogenic function of the long non-coding RNA; metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) in HCC remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate MALAT1 serum expression profile in HCC and explore its relation to the clinicopathological features. Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction was applied in 70 cohorts (30 HCC, 20 HCV, 20 controls). Further meta-analysis of clinical studies and in vitro validated experiments was employed. Serum MALAT1 showed area under the curve of 0.79 and 0.70 to distinguish patients with cancer from normal and cirrhotic individuals at fold change of 1.0 and 1.26, respectively. Expression level was significantly higher in males (P <0.001) and patients with massive ascites (P?=?0.005). Correlation analysis showed positive correlation of MALAT1 with total bilirubin (r?=?0.456, P <0.001) and AST (r?=?0.280, P?=?0.019), and negative correlation with the hemoglobin level (r?=?0.312, P?=?0.009). Meta-analysis showed that the over-expressed MALAT1 was linked to tumor number [Cohen's d?=?0.450, 95% CI (0.21 to 0.68)], clinical stage [Cohen's d?=?0.048, 95% CI (-0.83 to 0.74)], and AFP level [Cohen's d?=?0.354, 95% CI (0.1 to 0.57)]. In silico data analysis and systematic review confirmed MALAT1 oncogenic function in cancer development and progression. In conclusion, circulatory MALAT1 might represent a putative non-invasive prognostic biomarker indicating worse liver failure score in HCV-related HCC patients with traditional markers. Large-scale verification is warranted in future studies."
"Eleven 6-furfurylaminopurine (kinetin, Kin) derivatives were synthesized to obtain biologically active compounds. The prepared compounds were characterized using1H NMR, mass spectrometry combined with HPLC purity determination and elemental C, H, N analyses. The biological activity of new derivatives was tested on plant cells and tissues in cytokinin bioassays, such as tobacco callus, detached wheat leaf chlorophyll retention bioassay and Amaranthus bioassay. The selected compounds were subsequently tested on normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and keratinocyte cell lines (HaCaT) to exclude possible phototoxic effects and, on the other hand, to reveal possible UVA and UVB photoprotective activity. The protective antioxidant activity of the prepared cytokinin derivatives was further studied and compared to previously prepared antisenescent compound 6-furfurylamino-9-(tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)purine (Kin-THF) using induced oxidative stress (OS) on nematode Caenorhabditis elegans damaged by 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (juglone), a generator of reactive oxygen species. The observed biological activity was interpreted in relation to the structure of the prepared derivatives. The most potent oxidative stress protection of all the prepared compounds was shown by 6-(thiophen-2-ylmethylamino)-9-(tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)purine (6) and 2-chloro-6-furfurylamino-9-(tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)purine (9) derivatives and the results were comparable to Kin-THF. Compounds 6 and 9 were able to significantly protect human skin cells against UV radiation in vitro. Both the derivatives 6 and 9 showed higher protective activity in comparison to previously known structurally similar compounds Kin and Kin-THF. The obtained results are surprising due to the fact that the prepared compounds showed to be inactive in the ORAC assay which proved that the compounds did not act as direct antioxidants as they were unable to directly scavenge oxygen radicals."
"Microplastics (MPs) are the most numerous debris reported in marine environments and assessment of the amounts of MPs that accumulate in wild organisms is necessary for risk assessment. Our objective was to assess MP contamination in mussels collected around the coast of Scotland (UK) to identify characteristics of MPs and to evaluate risk of human exposure to MPs via ingestion of mussels. We deployed caged mussels (Mytilus edulis) in an urbanised estuary (Edinburgh, UK) to assess seasonal changes in plastic pollution, and collected mussels (Mytilus spp and subtidal Modiolus modiolus) from eight sampling stations around Scotland to enumerate MP types at different locations. We determined the potential exposure of humans to household dust fibres during a meal to compare with amounts of MPs present in edible mussels. The mean number of MPs in M. modiolus was 0.086?±?0.031 (SE, n?=?6)/g ww (3.5?±?1.29 (SE) per mussel). In Mytilus spp, the mean number of MPs/g ww was 3.0?±?0.9 (SE, n?=?36) (3.2?±?0.52 (SE) per mussel), but weight dependent. The visual accuracy of plastic fibres identification was estimated to be between 48 and 50%, using Nile Red staining and FT-IR methodologies, respectively, halving the observed amounts of MPs in wild mussels. We observed an allometric relationship between the number of MPs and the mussels wet weight. Our predictions of MPs ingestion by humans via consumption of mussels is 123?MP particles/y/capita in the UK and can go up to 4620 particles/y/capita in countries with a higher shellfish consumption. By comparison, the risk of plastic ingestion via mussel consumption is minimal when compared to fibre exposure during a meal via dust fallout in a household (13,731-68,415 particles/Y/capita)."
"Diplonemids were recently found to be the most species-rich group of marine planktonic protists. Based on phylogenetic analysis of 18S rRNA gene sequences and morphological observations, we report the description of new members of the genus Rhynchopus - R. humris sp. n. and R. serpens sp. n., and the establishment of two new genera - Lacrimia gen. n. and Sulcionema gen. n., represented by L. lanifica sp. n. and S. specki sp. n., respectively. In addition, we describe the organism formerly designated as Diplonema sp. 2 (ATCC 50224) as Flectonema neradi gen. n., sp. n. The newly described diplonemids share a common set of traits. Cells are sac-like but variable in shape and size, highly metabolic, and surrounded by a naked cell membrane, which is supported by a tightly packed corset of microtubules. They carry a single highly reticulated peripheral mitochondrion containing a large amount of mitochondrial DNA, with lamellar cristae. The cytopharyngeal complex and flagellar pocket are contiguous and have separate openings. Two parallel flagella are inserted sub-apically into a pronounced flagellar pocket. Rhynchopus species have their flagella concealed in trophic stages and fully developed in swimming stages, while they permanently protrude in all other known diplonemid species."
"Dispersions of polymer particle (DPPs) are increasingly being exploited both as biomolecule carriers, and as markers in various DPP biomedical applications related to cell and molecular biology, enzymology, immunology, diagnostics, in vitro and in vivo visualization, bioseparation, etc. Their potential to reduce reaction scales, lower costs, improve the rate, sensitivity, selectivity, stability and reproducibility of assays governs the diversity of their bioapplications. This review focuses on the design of DPPs with innovative special properties in the course of free radical heterophase polymerization that provides careful control of both macromolecular and colloidal properties. We demonstrate approaches that, according to the polymerization technique, regulate the particle size, shape, particle size distribution, morphology, surface chemistry and functionality, as well as the formation of organic-inorganic hybrid DPPs. The production of bioreagents based on DPPs and their use in bioassay are also reviewed."
"Owing to the ubiquity, critical importance and special properties, confined microenvironments have recently triggered overwhelming interest. In this work, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been conducted to address the confinement effects and ion-specific effects for electrolyte solutions within montmorillonite nanopores, where the pore widths vary with a wide range. The adsorption number, structure, dynamics and stability of inner- and outer-sphere metal ions are affected by the change of pore widths (confinement effects), while the extents are significantly dependent on the type of adsorbed species. The type of adsorbed species is, however, not altered by the magnitude of confinement effects, and confinement effects are similar for different electrolyte concentrations. Ion-specific effects are pronounced for all magnitudes of confinement effects (from non- to strong confined conditions), and Hofmeister sequences of outer-sphere species are closely associated with the magnitude of confinement effects while those of inner-sphere species remain consistent. In addition, mechanistic aspects of confinement have been posed using the electrical double layer theories, and the results can be generalized to other confined systems that are ubiquitous in biology, chemistry, geology and nanotechnology."
"We investigated the effects of conditioned medium (CM) from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (h BMMSC)s and pulse wave photobiomodulation (PW PBM), applied alone or in combination, on the stereological parameters and gene expression of some growth factors, during wound healing in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model of type one diabetes mellitus (T1DM). T1DM was induced in 72 rats and two incisions were made in each animal. The rats were assigned to one of four groups: a control (placebo) group, a Laser group (890?nm, 80?Hz, 0.2?J/cm2); a CM group, and a combined CM?+?Laser group. On post-surgical days 4, 7, and 15, skin samples were extracted for stereology and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analyses of gene expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1?), and stromal cell-derived factor-1? (SDF-1?). The stereological examinations of the proximal and distal wounds revealed significantly enhanced healing in all the treated groups, compared to the control group. The extent of healing was significantly greater in the CM?+?Laser group than in the other treatment groups. The RT-PCR results also indicated greater gene expression in the CM?+?Laser and Laser groups than in the CM and control groups. Application of CM and PW PBM, alone or in combination accelerated the process of wound healing in T1DM rats. The results of combined application of CM and PW PBM, indicated a synergistic effect, and the combination treatment was statistically more effective than single applications of CM or PW PBM."
"Humanized mice, that is, animals engrafted with human tissues and/or expressing human genes, have been instrumental in improving our understanding of the pathogenesis and immunological processes that define some of the most challenging human-tropic viruses. In particular, mice engrafted with components of a human immune system (HIS) offer unprecedented opportunities for mechanistic studies of human immune responses to infection. Here, we provide a brief overview of the current panel of HIS mouse models available and cite recent examples of how such humanized animals have been used to study immune responses and pathogenesis elicited by human-tropic viruses. Finally, we will outline some of the challenges that lay ahead and strategies to improve and refine humanized mice with the goal of more accurately recapitulating human immune responses to viral infection."
"Major obstetric hemorrhage (MOH) is the leading cause of severe maternal morbidity and mortality, and can have a significant impact on a woman's life. This study aims to gain insight into the patients reported experiences (PREs) and outcomes (PROs) after a major obstetric hemorrhage, and to investigate which patients are most at risk for negative experiences.A Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) based questionnaire was developed covering items on the PREs and PROs, and send to all patients with blood loss exceeding 2500?ml in six hospitals over the period of 2008-2012. A regression analysis was performed to find determinants for negative experiences.In total 372 of the 570 questionnaires were returned. Women scored the overall care before, during and after the MOH with a mean of 7.67, 7.62 and 7.28, respectively. However, most PRE items individually were scored suboptimal, with items regarding information supply scoring the lowest. Our results on the PROs showed 81% of the women (362) sustaining extreme fatigue, whereas problems with concentration (53% of 373 women), memory (49% of 353), or reliving (49% of 356) and irritability (51% of 355) were also frequently endured. Negative long term effects were observed in 28% of the women (106 of 372). We found 'year of the MOH longer ago', 'a lower total blood loss' and 'a large location of birth' to be determinants for negative experiences.Women frequently reported negative experiences and outcomes following a MOH. Information supply after an MOH concerning both physical and psychological complaints is essential for the improvement of care."
"Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are the most common source of non-dental pain. The pathogenesis of TMD is multifactorial, involving biological, psychological and behavioral factors. Those factors are involved with alterations of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and stressful conditions. Heart rate variability (HRV) has been used as a marker of ANS function. Increased cortisol level (a stress indicator), has been found in chronic pain. Therefore, the present study aimed to compare pain intensity, HRV, psychological factors, and salivary cortisol level between TMD patients and a control group. Twenty-one TMD patients and twenty-three healthy control subjects participated in the study. All participants underwent 24-h-Holter monitoring to record HRV. Morning unstimulated saliva samples were collected from each participant for cortisol analysis. The pain intensity was assessed using a visual analog scale. The participants were evaluated for anxiety and depression via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales. We found that pain intensity and psychological distress in the TMD group were significantly greater than those of the control (p?<?0.01). Pain intensity showed a positive correlation with psychological distress (p?<?0.01). HRV parameters in the TMD group were significantly lower than those in the control, suggesting reduced HRV in TMD patients. Pain intensity was negatively associated with HRV. Salivary cortisol level of the TMD group was greater than that of control. Our findings indicate that reduced HRV with higher psychological distress and increased salivary cortisol levels were observed in the TMD group. Therefore, TMD patients may benefit from interventions that can restore ANS function and stress balance."
"Adventitious roots (ARs) emerge from stems, leaves or hypocotyls, being strategic for clonal propagation. ARs may develop spontaneously, upon environmental stress or hormonal treatment. Auxins strongly influence AR development (ARD), depending on concentration and kind. However, the role of different types of auxin is rarely compared at the molecular level. Rooting triggered by light exposure and flooding was examined in intact etiolated Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls treated with distinct auxin types. Morphological aspects, rooting-related gene expression profiles, and IAA immunolocalization were recorded. NAA and 2,4-D effects were highly dose-dependent; at higher concentrations NAA inhibited root growth and 2,4-D promoted callus formation. NAA yielded the highest number of roots, but inhibited elongation. IAA increased the number of roots with less interference in elongation, yielding the best overall rooting response. IAA was localized close to the tissues of root origin. Auxin stimulated ARD was marked by increased expression of PIN1 and GH3.3. NAA treatment induced expression of CYCB1, GH3.6 and ARF8. These NAA-specific responses may be associated with the development of numerous shorter roots. In contrast, expression of the auxin action inhibitor IAA28 was induced by IAA. Increased PIN1 expression indicated the relevance of auxin efflux transport for focusing in target cells, whereas GH3.3 suggested tight control of auxin homeostasis. IAA28 increased expression during IAA-induced ARD differs from what was previously reported for lateral root development, pointing to yet another possible difference in the molecular programs of these two developmental processes."
"Digital subtractional angiography (DSA) is the standard method for diagnosis, assessment and management of arteriovenous malformation in the brain. Conventional DSA (cDSA) is an invasive imaging modality that is often indicated before interventional treatments (embolization, open surgery, gamma knife). Here, we aimed to compare this technique with a non-invasive MR angiography (MRI DSA) for brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM).Fourteen patients with ruptured brain AVM underwent embolization treatment pre-operation. Imaging was performed for all patients using MRI (1.5?T). After injecting contrast Gadolinium, dynamic MRI was performed with 40 phases, each phase of a duration of 1.2?s and having 70 images. The MRI results were independently assessed by experienced radiologist blinded to the cDSA.The AVM nidus was depicted in all patients using cDSA and MRI DSA; there was an excellent correlation between these techniques in terms of the maximum diameter and Spetzler Martin grading. Of the fourteen patients, the drainage vein was depicted in 13 by both cDSA and MRI DSA showing excellent correlation between the techniques used.MRI DSA is a non-invasive imaging modality that can give the images in dynamic view. It can be considered as an adjunctive method with cDSA to plan the strategy treatment for bAVM."
"Increasing anthropogenic activities in the Amazon have led to elevated metals in the aquatic environment. Since fish are the main source of animal protein for the Amazonian population, understanding metal bioaccumulation patterns and physiological impacts is of critical importance. Juvenile tambaqui, a local model species, were exposed to chronic dietary Cu (essential, 500??g Cu/g food) and Cd (non-essential, 500??g Cd/g food). Fish were sampled at 10-14, 18-20 and 33-36?days of exposure and the following parameters were analyzed: growth, voluntary food consumption, conversion efficiency, tissue-specific metal bioaccumulation, ammonia and urea-N excretion, O2consumption, Pcrit, hypoxia tolerance, nitrogen quotient, major blood plasma ions and metabolites, gill and gut enzyme activities, and in vitro gut fluid transport. The results indicate no ionoregulatory impacts of either of the metal-contaminated diets at gill, gut, or plasma levels, and no differences in plasma cortisol or lactate. The Cd diet appeared to have suppressed feeding, though overall tank growth was not affected. Bioaccumulation of both metals was observed. Distinct tissue-specific and time-specific patterns were seen. Metal burdens in the edible white muscle remained low. Overall, physiological impacts of the Cu diet were minimal. However dietary Cd increased hypoxia tolerance, as evidenced by decreased Pcrit, increased time to loss of equilibrium, a lack of plasma glucose elevation, decreased plasma ethanol, and decreased NQ during hypoxia. Blood O2transport characteristics (P50, Bohr coefficient, hemoglobin, hematocrit) were unaffected, suggesting that tissue level changes in metabolism accounted for the greater hypoxia tolerance in tambaqui fed with a Cd-contaminated diet."
"Neutrophil adhesion to the vasculature in response to potent inflammatory stimuli, such as TNF-? (TNF), can contribute to atheroprogression amongst other pathophysiological mechanisms. Previous studies have shown that simvastatin, a statin with known pleiotropic anti-inflammatory properties, can partially abrogate the effects of TNF-induced neutrophil adhesion, in association with the modulation of ?2-integrin expression. We aimed to further characterize the effects of this statin on neutrophil and leukocyte adhesive mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. A microfluidic assay confirmed the ability of simvastatin to inhibit TNF-induced human neutrophil adhesion to fibronectin ligand under conditions of shear stress, while intravital imaging microscopy demonstrated an abrogation of leukocyte recruitment by simvastatin in the microvasculature of mice that had received a TNF stimulus. This inhibition of neutrophil adhesion was accompanied by the inhibition of TNF-induced RhoA activity in human neutrophils, and alterations in cell morphology and ?2-integrin activity. Additionally, TNF augmented the activity of the p50 NF?B subunit in human neutrophils and TNF-induced neutrophil adhesion and ?2-integrin activity could be abolished using pharmacological inhibitors of NF?B translocation, BAY11-7082 and SC514. Accordingly, the TNF-induced elevation of neutrophil p50 activity was abolished by simvastatin. In conclusion, our data provide further evidence of the ability of simvastatin to inhibit neutrophil adhesive interactions in response to inflammatory stimuli, both in vivo and in vitro. Simvastatin appears to inhibit neutrophil adhesion by interfering in TNF-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements, in association with the inhibition of Rho A activity, NF?B translocation and, consequently, ?2-integrin activity."
"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are being developed as vectors for the treatment of genetic disorders. However, pre-existing antibodies present a significant limitation to achieving optimal efficacy for the AAV gene delivery system. Efforts aimed at engineering vectors with the ability to evade the immune response include identification of residues on the virus capsid important for these interactions and changing them. Here K531 is identified as the determinant of monoclonal antibody ADK6 recognition by AAV6, and not the closely related AAV1. The AAV6-ADK6 complex structure was determined by cryo-electron microscopy and the footprint confirmed by cell-based assays. The ADK6 footprint overlaps previously identified AAV antigenic regions and neutralizes by blocking essential cell surface glycan attachment sites. This study thus expands the available repertoire of AAV-antibody information that can guide the design of host immune escaping AAV vectors able to maintain capsid functionality."
"Aeromonas sp. AMG272 is a Gram-negative bacterium that has been isolated from agricultural soil and studied for its plant growth-promoting activities. Structures of the O-specific polysaccharide chain of the AMG272 lipopolysaccharide and its capsular polysaccharide were elucidated using GLC-MS and NMR spectroscopy. The structure of the O-specific polysaccharide, ?4)-?-l-Rhap-(1???3)-?-d-GlcpNAc-(1?, has been found in other Aeromonas strains and related bacteria, whereas the structure of the capsular polysaccharide has not been reported before: ?6)[?-d-Fucp3NAc4Ac-(1???3)]-?-d-GlcpNAc-(1???4)-?-d-Galp-(1???3)-?-d-GalpNAc-(1???4)-?-d-Galp-(1???."
"In the ecotoxicological assessment of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soil, microbial community profile is important aspect due to their involvement in soil functions. However, soil physicochemical properties and the inhabiting plants could dictate the microbial composition. A question remains unanswered is, how an integrated approach may be utilized to account for various contrasting soil properties, plant types (reference vs. native) and the nature of the hydrocarbon contamination. In this study, we utilized bacterial DNA profiling techniques to investigate the relationship between soil properties, contaminant and plant species. Results identified that Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the most abundant bacteria of the 45 phyla identified in the hydrocarbon-contaminated soil. The bulk and rhizosphere microbiome showed that the contaminated soil originally had quite distinct bacterial communities compared to the artificially contaminated soil (mine soil =?95 genera vs. other soils =?2-29 genera). In these cases, not significantly but the native plant slightly increased bacterial diversity and relative abundance in the same soils. Also, within each site, the bacterial community was significantly altered with the hydrocarbon concentration. In this instance, the influence of the contaminant was strong and also with the soil pH and organic matter. These results would significantly contribute to the novel insights on the molecular technique-based hydrocarbon toxicity assessment and the development of the further integrative approach with other microbial community and their metabolic profile in the contaminated sites."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronically progressive neurodegenerative disease, with its main pathological hallmarks being a dramatic loss of dopaminergic neurons predominantly in the Substantia Nigra (SN), and the formations of intracytoplasmic Lewy bodies and dystrophic neurites. Alpha-synuclein (?-syn), widely recognized as the most prominent element of the Lewy body, is one of the representative hallmarks in PD. However, the mechanisms behind the increased ?-syn expression and aggregation have not yet been clarified. To examine what causes ?-syn expression to increase, we analyzed the pattern of gene expression in the SN of mice intoxicated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), where down-regulation of dopaminergic cells occurred. We identified serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase 1 (SGK1) as one of the genes that is evidently downregulated in chronic MPTP-intoxication. The results of Western blot analyses showed that, together with the down-regulation of dopaminergic cells, the decrease in SGK1 expression increased ?-syn expression in the SN in a chronic MPTP-induced Parkinsonism mouse. For an examination of the expression correlation between SGK1 and ?-syn, SH-5YSY cells were knocked down with SGK1 siRNA then, the downregulation of dopaminergic cells and the increase in the expression of ?-syn were observed. These results suggest that decreased expression of SGK1 may play a critical role in increasing the expression of ?-syn, which is related with dopaminergic cell death in the SN of chronic MPTP-induced Parkinsonism mice and in SH-SY5Y cells."
"Systems biology approaches can help understand pathogenesis of complex human diseases like cancers for identification of potential new therapeutic targets. Here in this study, we performed genome-wide screening for mRNA and lncRNA profiles in esophageal cancer to identify the novel cancer-related mRNA and lncRNA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We identified 1260 up-regulated/1445 down-regulated mRNAs and 402 up-regulated/741 down-regulated lncRNAs. Further functional analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of mRNA and lncRNA are related to different pathways. mRNA pathways are mainly involved in cell cycles while lncRNA pathways are for regulation and metabolic procession. Differentially expressed mRNAs/lncRNAs were validated with qPCR. At last, mRNA and lncRNA co-expression network were built and highly-connected networks were identified, which may provide a mechanism of mRNA expression regulation by lncRNA. In together, we used next generation sequencing data to explore the co-expression networks of lncRNA and mRNA, which may elucidate the functions and mechanisms of lncRNA in ESCC."
"High-order assemblies of amelogenin, the major protein in enamel protein matrix, are believed to act as the template for enamel mineral formation. The Leucine-rich amelogenin (LRAP) is a natural splice-variant of amelogenin, a functional protein in vivo, containing conserved domains of amelogenin. In this work, we showed LRAP aggregates hierarchically into assemblies with various sizes including scattered beads, beads-on-a-string and gel-like precipitations in the presence of both calcium and phosphate ions. Solid-state NMR combined with X-ray diffraction and microscopic techniques, was applied to give a picture of LRAP self-assemblies at the atomic level. Our results, for the first time, confirmed LRAP assemblies with different sizes all contained a consistent rigid segment with ?-sheet secondary structure (residues 12-27) and the ?-sheet segment would further assemble into amyloid-like structures."
"The transition metal alloy nanoparticles (NPs) have received significant attention because of their unique physicochemical properties as well as low cost. Herein, we report a facile and clean synthetic route to prepare porous FeCo/C bimetallic alloy nanocomposites by using metal-organic gels (MOGs) as precursors. The bimetallic MOGs based on iron and cobalt bridged by tri-carboxylate organic ligands were first synthesized by a general and fast solvothermal method. The desired FeCo/C nanocomposites were then obtained by a one-step annealing process in which MOGs served as both the precursor and the self-sacrificing template. Significantly, the as-synthesized FeCo/C nanocomposites exhibit excellent catalytic activity and lithium-ion batteries performance. This fast and clean synthetic strategy is extended to synthesis diversity and range of potential applications of porous carbon-coated transition-metal alloy nanocomposites."
"Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) is a rate-limiting enzyme in thymidine catabolism. TP has several important roles in biological and pharmacological mechanisms; importantly TP acts as an angiogenic factor and one of metabolic enzymes of fluoro-pyrimidine anticancer agents and modifies inflammation. Improving our understanding of the characteristics and functions of TP has led to the development of novel TP-based anticancer therapies. We recently reported that TP-dependent thymidine catabolism contributes to tumour survival in low nutrient conditions and the pathway from thymidine to the glycolysis cascade is affected in the context of physiological and metabolic conditions. In this review, we describe recent advancement in our understanding of TP, with a focus on cancer cell biology and the pharmacology of pyrimidine analogue anticancer agents. This review provides comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism of TP function in cancer."
"Urban wastewater contains different micropollutants and high number of different microorganisms. Some bacteria in wastewater can attach to the surfaces and form biofilm, which gives bacteria advantage in fight against environmental stress. This work is focused on bacterial community analysis in biofilms isolated from influent and effluent sewerage of wastewater treatment plant in Bratislava.Biofilm microbiota detection was performed by culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches. Composition of bacterial strains was detected by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting coupled with the construction of 16S rRNA clone libraries.The biofilm collected at the inlet point was characterized primarily by the presence of Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp. and Janthinobacterium sp. clones, while in the biofilm isolated at outflow of wastewater treatment plant members of Pseudomonas genus were largely detected. Beside this analysis prevalence of antibiotics and resistant coliforms, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. in sewerage was studied. In influent wastewater were dominant antibiotics like azithromycin, clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin. Removal efficiency of these antibiotics notably azithromycin and clarithromycin were 30% in most cases.The highest number of resistant bacteria with predominance of coliforms was detected in sample of effluent biofilm. Multidrug resistant strains in effluent biofilm showed very good ability to form biofilm."
"Neurons have well-developed membrane microdomains called ""rafts"" that are recovered as a detergent-resistant low-density membrane microdomain fraction (DRM). NAP-22 is one of the major protein components of neuronal DRM and localizes in the presynaptic region. In order to know the role of NAP-22 in the synaptic transmission, NAP-22 binding proteins in the cytosol were searched with an affinity screening with NAP-22 as a bait and several protein bands were detected. Using mass-analysis and western blotting, one of the main band of ?90?kDa was identified as dynamin I. The GTPase activity of dynamin I was partly inhibited by NAP-22 expressed in bacteria and this inhibition was recovered by the addition of calmodulin, a NAP-22 binding protein. The GTPase activity of dynamin was known to be activated with acidic membrane lipids such as phosphatidylserine and the addition of NAP-22, a phosphatidylserine binding protein, inhibited the activation of the GTPase by this lipid. Since NAP-22 localizes on the presynaptic plasma membrane and on synaptic vesicles, these results suggest the participation of NAP-22 in the membrane cycling through binding to dynamin and acidic membrane lipids at the presynaptic region."
"Deposition of the H2A.Z histone variant by the SWR1 complex (SWR1-C) in regulatory regions of specific loci modulates transcription. Characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana mutations in homologs of the yeast SWR1-C has revealed a role for H2A.Z exchange in a variety of developmental processes; nevertheless, the exact composition of the plant SWR1-C and how it is recruited to target genes remains to be established. Here we show that SWC4, the Arabidopsis homolog of the yeast SANT domain protein Swc4/Eaf2, is a DNA-binding protein that interacts with SWR1-C subunits. We demonstrate that the swc4-1 knock-out mutant is embryo lethal, while SWC4 RNAi knockdown lines displayed pleiotropic phenotypic alterations in vegetative and reproductive traits, including acceleration of flowering time, indicating that SWC4 controls post-embryonic processes. Transcriptomic analyses and genome-wide profiling of H2A.Z indicate that SWC4 represses transcription of a number of genes including the floral integrator FT and key transcription factors mainly by modulating H2A.Z deposition. Interestingly, SWC4 silencing does not affect H2A.Z deposition in the FLC locus nor expression of this gene, a master regulator of flowering previously shown to be controlled by SWR1-C. Importantly, we find that SWC4 is a DNA-binding protein recognizing specific AT-rich DNA elements in chromatin regions of target genes and that SWC4 silencing impairs SWR1-C binding at FT. Collectively, our data suggest that SWC4 regulates plant growth and development through aiding SWR1-C recruitment and modulating H2A.Z deposition."
"When compared to solid brain metastases from NSCLC, leptomeningeal disease (LMD) has unique growth patterns and is rapidly fatal. LMD does not undergo surgical resection, limiting the tissue available for scientific research. Here we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 8 LMD samples to identify somatic mutations and compared the results with 26 solid brain metastases. We found that TAS2R31 and PDE4DIP were recurrently mutated among LMD samples, suggesting involvement in LMD progression. Together with retrospective chart review of an additional 44 NSCLC LMD patients, we discovered a surprisingly low number of KRAS mutations (n=4, 7.7%), but a high number of EGFR mutations (n=33, 63.5%). The median interval for developing LMD from NSCLC was shorter in EGFR-mutant (16.3 mo) than wild-type (23.9 mo) patients (p = 0.017). Targeted analysis of recurrent mutations thus presents a useful complement to the existing diagnostic toolkit, and correlations of EGFR in LMD and KRAS in solid metastases suggest molecular distinctions or systemic treatment pressure underpinning differences in growth patterns within the brain."
"During pregnancy, the progesterone metabolite, allopregnanolone (ALLO), becomes elevated and has been associated with altered levels within the CNS and resulting changes in GABAAreceptor function. Pregnant animals poorly compensate reflexes for a decrease in blood pressure during hemorrhage. Previous works suggested that ALLO decreases baroreflex responses by central actions, however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we tested ALLO actions on visceral afferent synaptic transmission at second-order neurons within medial portions of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) using hindbrain slices from non-pregnant female rats. Solitary tract (ST) stimulation-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (ST-eEPSCs) in NTS neurons directly connected to vagal afferents within the ST. ST-eEPSCs were functionally identified as monosynaptic by the latency characteristics (low jitter?=?standard deviation of latency, ?200??s) to ST stimulation. Such second-order neurons all displayed spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs), and low micromolar concentrations of ALLO increased frequency and decay time. At submicromolar concentrations, ALLO induced a tonic, GABAergic inhibitory current and suppressed ST-eEPSCs' amplitude. While GABAAreceptor antagonist, bicuculline, blocked all ALLO effects, gabazine only blocked sIPSC actions. In current-clamp mode, ALLO perfusion increased failure of ST stimulation to trigger action potentials in most neurons. Thus, our results indicate that ALLO acts to suppress visceral afferent ST synaptic transmission at first synapses by activating pharmacologically distinct GABAAsubtypes at different concentration ranges. This ALLO-mediated attenuated visceral afferent signal integration in NTS may underlie reflex changes in blood pressure during gestation."
