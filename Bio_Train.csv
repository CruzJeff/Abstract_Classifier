"The developing world is seeing rapid growth in the availability of biological mass spectrometry (MS), particularly through core facilities. As proteomics and metabolomics becomes locally feasible for investigators in these nations, application areas associated with high burden in these nations, such as infectious disease, will see greatly increased research output. This article evaluates the rapid growth of MS in South Africa (currently approaching 20 laboratories) as a model for establishing MS core facilities in other nations of the developing world. Facilities should emphasize new services rather than new instruments. The reduction of the delays associated with reagent and other supply acquisition would benefit both facilities and the users who make use of their services. Instrument maintenance and repair, often mediated by an in-country business for an international vendor, is also likely to operate on a slower schedule than in the wealthiest nations. A key challenge to facilities in the developing world is educating potential facility users in how best to design experiments for proteomics and metabolomics, what reagents are most likely to introduce problematic artifacts, and how to interpret results from the facility. Here, we summarize the experience of 6 different institutions to raise the level of biological MS available to researchers in South Africa."
"To create a framework for genetic dissection of hexaploid triticale, six populations of doubled haploid (DH) lines were developed from pairwise hybrids of high-yielding winter triticale cultivars. The six populations comprise between 97 and 231 genotyped DH lines each, totaling 957 DH lines. A consensus genetic map spans 4593.9 cM is composed of 1576 unique DArT markers. The maps reveal several structural rearrangements in triticale genomes. In preliminary tests of the populations and maps, markers specific to wheat segments of the engineered rye chromosome 1R (RM1B) were identified. Example QTL mapping of days to heading in cv. Krakowiak revealed loci on chromosomes 2BL and 2R responsible for extended vernalization requirement, and candidate genes were identified. The material is available to all parties interested in triticale genetics."
"Behavioral plasticity within species is adaptive which directs survival traits to take multiple pathways under varying conditions. Male-male cooperation is an evolutionary strategy often exhibiting an array of alternatives between and within species. African male lions coalesce to safeguard territories and mate acquisition. Unique to these coalitions is lack of strict hierarchies between partners, who have similar resource securities possibly because of many mating opportunities within large female groups. Skewed mating and feeding rights have only been documented in large coalitions where males were related. However, smaller modal prey coupled with less simultaneous mating opportunities for male Asiatic lions in Gir forests, India would likely result in a different coalition structure. Observations on mating events (n= 127) and feeding incidents (n= 44) were made on 11 male coalitions and 9 female prides in Gir, to assess resource distribution within and among different sized male coalitions. Information from 39 males was used to estimate annual tenure-holding probabilities. Single males had smaller tenures and appropriated fewer matings than coalition males. Pronounced dominance hierarchies were observed within coalitions, with one partner getting more than 70% of all matings and 47% more food. Competition between coalition partners at kills increased with decline in prey size, increase in coalition size and the appetite states of the males. However, immediate subordinates in coalitions had higher reproductive fitness than single males. Declining benefits to partners with increasing coalition size, with individuals below the immediate subordinates having fitness comparable to single males, suggest to an optimal coalition size of 2 lions. Lions under different competitive selection in Gir show behavioral plasticity to form hierarchical coalitions, wherein partners utilize resources asymmetrically, yet coalesce for personal gains."
"To study the fitness effects of individual variation in cognitive traits, it is paramount to understand whether traits such as personality and physiological stress influence cognitive performance. We first tested whether budgerigars showed both consistent personalities and cognitive performance across time and tasks. We tested object and food neophobia, and exploratory behavior. We measured cognitive performance in habituation, ability to solve foraging problems, spatial memory, and seed discrimination tasks. Budgerigars showed consistency in their neophobic tendencies and these tendencies were associated with their exploratory behavior. Birds were also consistent in how they performed in most of the cognitive tasks (temporal consistency), but were not consistent in their performance across tasks (context consistency). Neither corticosterone levels (baseline and stress-induced) showed a significant relationship with either cognitive or personality measures. Neophobic and exploratory tendencies determined the willingness of birds to engage only in the seed discrimination task. Such tendencies also had a significant effect on problem-solving ability. Our results suggest that consistent individual differences in cognitive performance along with consistent differences in personality could determine response to environmental change and therefore have important fitness consequences."
"Exaggerated male traits can evolve under intra- or intersexual selection, but it remains less clear how often both mechanisms act together on trait evolution. While the males of many anthropoid primate species exhibit colorful signals that appear to be badges of status under intrasexual selection, the red facial coloration of male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) appears to have evolved primarily under intersexual selection and female mate choice. Nonetheless, experiments show that red color is salient to males, raising the question of whether the signal may also be under intrasexual selection. Here, we examine whether males express this signal more strongly in competitive contexts. Facial images were collected on all 15 adult males of a free-ranging social group during the peak of the mating season, and coloration was quantified using visual models. Results show that males more similar in facial redness were more likely to interact aggressively than more dissimilar ones, suggesting that color may be involved in the assessment of rivals. Furthermore, males exhibited darker coloration on days they were observed copulating, and dominance rank predicted facial redness only on copulating days, suggesting that coloration may also advertise motivation to defend a mate. Male rhesus macaque facial coloration may thus mediate agonistic interactions with rivals during competition over reproductive opportunities, such that it is under both inter- and intrasexual selection. However, color differences were small, raising perceptibility questions. It remains possible that color variation reflects differences in male condition, which in turn alter investment towards male-male competition and mating effort."
"Autotomy, self-induced limb loss, is an extreme trait observed throughout the animal kingdom; lizards drop their tails, crickets release their legs, and crabs drop their claws. These repeated evolutionary origins suggest that autotomy is adaptive. Yet, we do not have a firm understanding of the selective pressures that promote and maintain this extreme trait. Although multiple adaptive hypotheses exist, research has generally focused on autotomy's adaptive value as a form of predator escape. However, autotomy could also be selected to reduce the cost of an injured limb, which we investigate here. Previously, this alternative hypothesis has been challenging to directly test because when an injury occurs on an autotomizable limb, that limb is almost always dropped (i.e., autotomy is behaviorally fixed within populations). Recently, however, we have identified a species,Narnia femorata(Insecta: Hemiptera: Coreidae), where some individuals autotomize limbs in response to injury, but some do not. This natural variation allowed us to investigate both the survival costs of retaining an injured limb and the benefits of autotomizing it. In this study, we find a positive association between autotomizing injured limbs and survival, thereby quantifying a new and likely widespread benefit of autotomy-reducing the cost of injury."
"Adaptation to ecologically contrasting niches can lead to the formation of new species. Theoretically, this process of ecological speciation can be driven by pleiotropic ""magic traits"" that genetically link natural and sexual selection. To qualify as a true magic trait, the pleiotropic function of a gene must be reflected in biologically relevant mechanisms underlying both local adaptation and mate choice. The immune genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) contribute to parasite resistance and also play a major role in sexual selection. Hence, the MHC may encode a candidate magic trait. Using diverging 3-spined stickleback populations from a connected lake-river habitat, we show with mate choice experiments in a flow channel that polymorphic MHC genes probably underlie assortative mating with respect to particular habitat-adapted ecotypes, potentially resulting in reproductive isolation. By manipulating olfactory cues in controlled experiments, we show that female sticklebacks employ MHC-dependent male olfactory signals to select mates with which they can achieve a habitat-specific MHC gene structure that optimally protects their offspring against local parasites. By using MHC-based olfactory signals, females thus select individuals of their own population as mates. Our results demonstrate how mate choice and parasite resistance may be functionally linked. These findings suggest that MHC genes are pleiotropic and encode a true magic trait of biologically significant effect."
"Quantifying consistent differences in behaviour among individuals is vital to understanding the ecological and evolutionary significance of animal personality. To quantify personality, the phenotypic variation of a behavioural trait is partitioned to assess how it varies among individuals, which is also known as repeatability. If pedigree data are available, the phenotypic variation can then be further partitioned to estimate the additive genetic variance and heritability. Assessing the repeatability and heritability of personality traits therefore allows for a better understanding of what natural selection can act upon, enabling evolution. In a natural population of facultative cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) on Cousin Island, a lack of breeding vacancies forces individuals into different life-history strategies, and these differences in reproductive state could generate behavioural differences among individuals in the population. We used this population to estimate the repeatability of 4 behavioural traits (novel environment exploration, novel object exploration, obstinacy/struggle rate, and escape response), and narrow-sense heritability (of behavior,h2B; behavior minus observer variance; and personality), and evolvability, of the repeatable behavioural traits. We also tested for an among-individual correlation between the repeatable traits. We found that, compared to estimates in other study species, the exploratory behaviours were moderately repeatable (0.23-0.37), there was a positive among-individual correlation (0.51) between novel environment and novel object exploration, and that novel environment exploration was moderately heritable (0.17;h2Bwas low as it includes observer variance). This study further clarifies the additive genetic variance available for selection to act upon in this cooperatively breeding bird."
"Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infections remain an important public health problem in the tropics. This study aimed to evaluate the soil contamination rate and prevalence of infestations of geohelminth among residents in Bazou.Four hundred (400) soil samples and 182 stool specimens were collected respectively from four sites and from inhabitants aged 1 to 40 years and above in 12 households. A questionnaire was administered to evaluate risk factors of STH-infections. Soil samples were screened using sucrose centrifugal flotation method while stool specimens were analyzed using two techniques.Out of the 400 soil and 182 stool samples examined, 13(3.3%) and 9(4.95%) were positive respectively after analyses. Soil contamination rates were 2%, 1% and 0.3% for Ascaris, Trichuris and hookworm eggs respectively while 4.95% of stool samples were positive to one species nematode (Ascaris lumbricoides). The soil contamination rate observed (5%) in the rainy season was significantly different (p>0.05) from the one observed (1.5%) in the dry season. Irrespectively of the season, the most frequent parasite identified was Ascaris spp. Soils around houses were more contaminated 6(12%) as compared to those collected from markets 5(10%) and roads 2(4%) while those around classrooms were not contaminated. Participants in the age group of 1-10 were more infected. Factors such as no hand washing habit and untrimmed finger nails were found to be important risk factors for STH.These results suggest the necessity to promote measures that could help to reduce STH infections."
"This study investigates the significance of the expression and dynamics of podoplanin in mechanostress and mineralization in cultured murine osteoblasts. Podoplanin increased in osteoblasts subjected to straining in non-mineralization medium, suggesting that the mechanostress alone is a podoplanin induction factor. In osteoblasts subjected to vertical elongation straining in the mineralization medium, the mRNA amounts of podoplanin, osteopontin, and osteocalcin were significantly larger than those in cells not subjected to straining, suggesting that mechanostress is the cause of a synergistic effect in the expression of these proteins. In osteoblasts in the mineralization medium, significant increases in osteocalcin mRNA occurred earlier in cells subjected to straining than in the cells not subjected to straining, suggesting that the mechanostress is a critical factor to enhance the expression of osteocalcin. Western blot and ELISA analysis showed increased podoplanin production in osteoblasts with longer durations of straining. There was significantly less mineralization product in osteoblasts with antibodies for podoplanin, osteopontin, and osteocalcin. There was also less osteopontin and osteocalcin produced in osteoblasts with anti-podoplanin. These findings suggest that mechanostress induces the production of podoplanin in osteoblasts and that podoplanin may play a role in mineralization in cooperation with bone-associated proteins."
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that is caused by multiple factors, including dysfunction of the immune system and genetic and epigenetic alterations. Aberrant epigenetic regulation, especially histone acetylation, was found in biopsies from IBD patients and mouse models of colitis, suggesting that an epigenetic treatment approach may be useful for IBD therapy. Therefore, we investigated the effects of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), in a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. C57BL/6 mice were treated with 1.5% DSS for 5 days and/or SAHA (25 mg/kg BW/day) for 26 days. Levels of mRNA for the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?, and the chemokines, Ccl2, were examined by qRT-PCR. CD11b, a marker of dendritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes, as well as Ccl2 expression, were examined by immunohistochemistry. IL-6, TNF-?, and Ccl2 gene expression peaked on day 5 in DSS-treated mouse colon, whereas SAHA treatment significantly decreased pro-inflammatory gene expression. Ccl2 protein expression resembled Ccl2 gene expression results. Moreover, localization of CD11b showed that migratory inflammatory cells were dramatically decreased by SAHA treatment compared to DSS-treated mouse colon. Thus, we conclude that the HDAC inhibitor, SAHA, attenuates inflammatory changes in DSS-induced colitis by suppressing local secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and also by suppressing mobilization and accumulation of inflammatory cells."
"Estrogen affects mitochondrial function in various tissues, but the precise mechanism remains unclear. We, therefore investigated the effect on estrogen-regulated mitochondrial morphology by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and its Ser616-phosphorylated derivative (pDrp1Ser616) are involved in mitochondrial fission. MCF7 human breast cancer cells were treated with 17?-estradiol (E2), an estrogen receptor (ER) ? and ? antagonist (ICI 182, 780), an ER? antagonist (MPP), and an ER? antagonist (PHTPP) for 24 hr. The expression of Drp1 and pDrp1Ser616was analyzed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Mitochondrial morphology was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In control cells, Drp1 was detected in the cytoplasm of all cells while pDrp1 was observed in the cytoplasm of 3.4 ± 1.0% of the total population. After E2treatment, pDrp1Ser616-positive cells comprised 30.6 ± 5.6% of the total population, 10.5 ± 1.7% after E2+ ICI treatment, 12.4 ± 4.2% after E2+ MPP treatment, and 24.0 ± 2.2% after E2+ PHTPP treatment. In ER? knockdown MCF7 cells, pDrp1 expression was decreased after E2treatment compared to E2-treated wild type cells. Tubular pattern mitochondria were found in the control cells but the number of short and small pattern mitochondria (< 0.5 ?m2) was significantly increased after E2treatment (as observed by TEM). We, therefore concluded that the phosphorylation of Drp1 is important for E2-dependent mitochondrial morphological changes through ER?."
"Although the hypothalamus is classified into more than 10 compartments, it still contains uncharacterized areas. In this study, we identified a new triangular-shaped area between the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) and the fornix area in the mouse anterior hypothalamus, which is enriched in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). We designated this region as the perifornical area of the anterior hypothalamus (PeFAH) based on its anatomical location. As evidenced by Nissl staining, the PeFAH was distinguishable as an area of relatively low density. Immunohistochemical and DNA microarray analyses indicated that PeFAH contains sparsely distributed calretinin-positive neurons and densely clustered enkephalin-positive neurons. Furthermore, the PeFAH was shown to have bidirectional neural connections with the lateral septum. Indeed, we confirmed enkephalinergic projections from PeFAH neurons to the lateral septum, and inversely, calbindin-positive lateral septum neurons as afferents to the PeFAH. Finally, c-Fos expression analysis revealed that the activity of certain PeFAH neuronal populations tended to be increased by psychological stressors, but not that of enkephalinergic neurons. We proposed PeFAH as a new region in the AH."
"Cancer researchers have traditionally used the mouse and the rat as staple model organisms. These animals are very short-lived, reproduce rapidly and are highly prone to cancer. They have been very useful for modelling some human cancer types and testing experimental treatments; however, these cancer-prone species offer little for understanding the mechanisms of cancer resistance. Recent technological advances have expanded bestiary research to non-standard model organisms that possess unique traits of very high value to humans, such as cancer resistance and longevity. In recent years, several discoveries have been made in non-standard mammalian species, providing new insights on the natural mechanisms of cancer resistance. These include mechanisms of cancer resistance in the naked mole rat, blind mole rat and elephant. In each of these species, evolution took a different path, leading to novel mechanisms. Many other long-lived mammalian species display cancer resistance, including whales, grey squirrels, microbats, cows and horses. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of cancer resistance in all these species is important and timely, as, ultimately, these mechanisms could be harnessed for the development of human cancer therapies."
"We describe a two-stage protocol to generate electrically excitable and actively conducting cell networks with stable and customizable electrophysiological phenotypes. Using this method, we have engineered monoclonally derived excitable tissues as a robust and reproducible platform to investigate how specific ion channels and mutations affect action potential (AP) shape and conduction. In the first stage of the protocol, we combine computational modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrophysiological techniques to derive optimal sets of mammalian and/or prokaryotic ion channels that produce specific AP shape and conduction characteristics. In the second stage of the protocol, selected ion channels are stably expressed in unexcitable human cells by means of viral or nonviral delivery, followed by flow cytometry or antibiotic selection to purify the desired phenotype. This protocol can be used with traditional heterologous expression systems or primary excitable cells, and application of this method to primary fibroblasts may enable an alternative approach to cardiac cell therapy. Compared with existing methods, this protocol generates a well-defined, relatively homogeneous electrophysiological phenotype of excitable cells that facilitates experimental and computational studies of AP conduction and can decrease arrhythmogenic risk upon cell transplantation. Although basic cell culture and molecular biology techniques are sufficient to generate excitable tissues using the described protocol, experience with patch-clamp techniques is required to characterize and optimize derived cell populations."
"Chromosome conformation capture technologies such as Hi-C are widely used to investigate the spatial organization of genomes. Because genome structures can vary considerably between individual cells of a population, interpreting ensemble-averaged Hi-C data can be challenging, in particular for long-range and interchromosomal interactions. We pioneered a probabilistic approach for the generation of a population of distinct diploid 3D genome structures consistent with all the chromatin-chromatin interaction probabilities from Hi-C experiments. Each structure in the population is a physical model of the genome in 3D. Analysis of these models yields new insights into the causes and the functional properties of the genome's organization in space and time. We provide a user-friendly software package, called PGS, which runs on local machines (for practice runs) and high-performance computing platforms. PGS takes a genome-wide Hi-C contact frequency matrix, along with information about genome segmentation, and produces an ensemble of 3D genome structures entirely consistent with the input. The software automatically generates an analysis report, and provides tools to extract and analyze the 3D coordinates of specific domains. Basic Linux command-line knowledge is sufficient for using this software. A typical running time of the pipeline is ?3 d with 300 cores on a computer cluster to generate a population of 1,000 diploid genome structures at topological-associated domain (TAD)-level resolution."
"The utility of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is enhanced by an ability to precisely modify a chosen locus with minimal impact on the remaining genome. However, the derivation of gene-edited iPSCs typically involves multiple steps requiring lengthy culture periods and several clonal events. Here, we describe a one-step protocol for reliable generation of clonally derived gene-edited iPSC lines from human fibroblasts in the absence of drug selection or FACS enrichment. Using enhanced episomal-based reprogramming and CRISPR/Cas9 systems, gene-edited and passage-matched unmodified iPSC lines are obtained following a single electroporation of human fibroblasts. To minimize unwanted mutations within the target locus, we use a Cas9 variant that is associated with decreased nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) activity. This protocol outlines in detail how this streamlined approach can be used for both monoallelic and biallelic introduction of specific base changes or transgene cassettes in a manner that is efficient, rapid (?6-8 weeks), and cost-effective."
"DNA damage exposure is a major modifier of cell fate in both normal and cancer tissues. In response to DNA damage, myeloid leukemia cells activate a poorly understood terminal differentiation process. Here, we show that the NF?B pathway directly activates expression of the proliferation inhibitor p21 in response to DNA damage in myeloid leukemia cells. In order to understand the role of this unexpected regulatory event, we ablated the NF?B binding site we identified in the p21 promoter, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. We found that NF?B-mediated p21 activation controls DNA damage-induced myeloid differentiation. Our results uncover a p53-independent pathway for p21 activation involved in controlling hematopoietic cell fate."
"The small GTPase Rab34 regulates spatial distribution of the lysosomes, secretion, and macropinocytosis. In this study, we found that Rab34 is over-expressed in aggressive breast cancer cells, implying a potential role of Rab34 in breast cancer. Silencing Rab34 by shRNA inhibits cell migration, invasion, and adhesion of breast cancer cells. Rab34 specifically binds to the cytoplasmic tail of integrin ?3, and depletion of Rab34 promotes the degradation of integrin ?3. Interestingly, EGF induces the translocation of Rab34 to the membrane ruffle, which is greatly enhanced by the expression of Src kinase. Accordingly, Rab34 is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src at Y247 residue. A mutant mimicking phosphorylated form of Rab34 (Rab34Y247D) promotes cell migration and invasion. Importantly, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 is inhibited in cells in suspension, and increased with the cells re-adhesion. In addition, Rab34Y247D promotes cell adhesion, and enhances integrin ?3 endocytosis and recycling. The results uncover a role of Rab34 in migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and its involvement in cancer metastasis, and provide a novel mechanism of tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 in regulating cell migration, invasion, and adhesion through modulating the endocytosis, stability, and recycling of integrin ?3."
"The melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), a well-established melanoma susceptibility gene, regulates the amount and type of melanin pigments formed within epidermal melanocytes. MC1R variants associated with increased melanoma risk promote the production of photosensitizing pheomelanins as opposed to photoprotective eumelanins. Wild-type (WT) MC1R activates DNA repair and antioxidant defenses in a cAMP-dependent fashion. Since melanoma-associated MC1R variants are hypomorphic in cAMP signaling, these non-pigmentary actions are thought to be defective in MC1R-variant human melanoma cells and epidermal melanocytes, consistent with a higher mutation load in MC1R-variant melanomas. We compared induction of antioxidant enzymes and DNA damage responses in melanocytic cells of defined MC1R genotype. Increased expression of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes following MC1R activation was cAMP-dependent and required a WT MC1R genotype. Conversely, pretreatment of melanocytic cells with an MC1R agonist before an oxidative challenge with Luperox decreased (i) accumulation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanine, a major product of oxidative DNA damage, (ii) phosphorylation of histone H2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks, and (iii) formation of DNA breaks. These responses were comparable in cells WT for MC1R or harboring hypomorphic MC1R variants without detectable cAMP signaling. In MC1R-variant melanocytic cells, the DNA-protective responses were mediated by AKT. Conversely, in MC1R-WT melanocytic cells, high cAMP production downstream of MC1R blocked AKT activation and was responsible for inducing DNA repair. Accordingly, MC1R activation could promote repair of oxidative DNA damage by a cAMP-dependent pathway downstream of WT receptor, or via AKT in cells of variant MC1R genotype."
"The myocardium in hypertensive heart exhibits decreased fatty acid utilization and contractile dysfunction, leading to cardiac failure. However, the causal relationship between metabolic remodeling and cardiomyocyte contractility remains unestablished. Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) has been known to promote ATP production through the regulation of mitochondrial function. In this study, we investigated the involvement of TG2 in cardiomyocyte contraction under fatty acid supplementation. Using TG2 inhibitor and TG2-deficient mice, we demonstrated that fatty acid supplementation activated TG2 and increased ATP level and contractility of cardiac myocyte from the normal heart. By contrast, in cardiac myocytes from angiotensin-II-treated rats and mice, the effects of fatty acid supplementation on TG2 activity, ATP level, and myocyte contraction were abolished. We found that TG2 was inhibited by S-nitrosylation and its level increased in hypertensive myocytes. Treatment with inhibitor for neuronal NOS restored fatty acid-induced increase of TG2 activity and myocyte contraction. Moreover, intracellular Ca2+levels were increased by fatty acid supplementation in both normal and hypertensive myocytes, showing that S-nitrosylation of TG2 but not alteration of intracellular Ca2+levels is responsible for contractile dysfunction. These results indicate that TG2 plays a critical role in the regulation of myocyte contractility by promoting fatty acid metabolism and provide a novel target for preventing contractile dysfunction in heart with high workload."
"Cas9 (from Streptococcus pyogenes) in complex with a guide RNA targets complementary DNA for cleavage. Here, we developed a single-molecule FRET analysis to study the mechanisms of specificity enhancement of two engineered Cas9s (eCas9 and Cas9-HF1). A DNA-unwinding assay showed that mismatches affect cleavage reactions through rebalancing the unwinding-rewinding equilibrium. Increasing PAM-distal mismatches facilitates rewinding, and the associated cleavage impairment shows that cleavage proceeds from the unwound state. Engineered Cas9s depopulate the unwound state more readily with mismatches. The intrinsic cleavage rate is much lower for engineered Cas9s, preventing cleavage from transiently unwound off-targets. Engineered Cas9s require approximately one additional base pair match for stable binding, freeing them from sites that would otherwise sequester them. Therefore, engineered Cas9s achieve their improved specificity by inhibiting stable DNA binding to partially matching sequences, making DNA unwinding more sensitive to mismatches and slowing down the intrinsic cleavage reaction."
"Olfactory marker protein (OMP) is a marker of olfactory receptor-mediated chemoreception, even outside the olfactory system. Here, we report that OMP expression in the pituitary gland plays a role in basal and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-induced prolactin (PRL) production and secretion. We found that OMP was expressed in human and rodent pituitary glands, especially in PRL-secreting lactotrophs. OMP knockdown in GH4 rat pituitary cells increased PRL production and secretion via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling. Real-time PCR analysis and the Ca2+influx assay revealed that OMP was critical for TRH-induced PRL secretion. OMP-knockout mice showed lower fertility than control mice, which was associated with increased basal PRL production via activation of ERK1/2 signaling and reduced TRH-induced PRL secretion. However, both in vitro and in vivo results indicated that OMP was only required for hormone production and secretion because ERK1/2 activation failed to stimulate cell proliferation. Additionally, patients with prolactinoma lacked OMP expression in tumor tissues with hyperactivated ERK1/2 signaling. These findings indicate that OMP plays a role in PRL production and secretion in lactotrophs through the modulation of Ca2+and TRH signaling."
"In developing tissues, cells estimate their spatial position by sensing graded concentrations of diffusible signaling proteins called morphogens. Morphogen-sensing pathways exhibit diverse molecular architectures, whose roles in controlling patterning dynamics and precision remain unclear. Here, combining cell-based in vitro gradient reconstitution, genetic re-wiring, and mathematical modeling, we systematically analyzed the unique architectural features of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. The combination of double-negative regulatory logic and negative feedback through the PTCH receptor accelerates gradient formation and improves robustness to variation in the morphogen production rate compared to alternative designs. The ability to isolate morphogen patterning from concurrent developmental processes, and to compare the patterning behaviors of alternative, re-wired, pathway architectures offers a powerful way to understand and engineer multicellular patterning."
"A 58-year-old male patient was admitted at the São Bernardos's Hospital (Setúbal, Portugal) with generalised muscle spasms, dyspnoea, laryngospasm and bronchospasm in the context of severe hypocalcaemia. Despite efforts to correct serum calcium, it remained below average, leading to question the true cause of hypocalcaemia. Low parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, along with facial anomalies, palate defect and cognitive impairment with concomitant psychiatric disorder led to a suspicion of a DiGeorge/velocardiofacial/22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DS), which was confirmed through genetic testing. The 22q11.2 DS has a wide phenotypic expression and there are growing reports of diagnosis being made in adulthood. This case report highlights the importance of understanding the cause of refractory hypocalcaemia and alerts medical community to carefully access these patients, for this metabolic disorder may only present in later stages of life."
"In this era of personalized medicine, there is an expanded demand for advanced imaging biomarkers that reflect the biology of the whole tumor. Therefore, we investigated a large number of computed tomography-derived radiomics features along with demographics and pathology-related variables in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, correlating them with overall survival.Three hundred thirty-nine patients who underwent operation for lung adenocarcinoma were included. Analysis was performed using 161 radiomics features, demographic, and pathologic variables and correlated each with patient survival. Prognostic performance for survival was compared among three models: (a) using only clinicopathological data; (b) using only selected radiomics features; and (c) using both clinicopathological data and selected radiomics features.At multivariate analysis, age, pN, tumor size, type of operation, histologic grade, maximum value of the outer 1/3 of the tumor, and size zone variance were statistically significant variables. In particular, maximum value of outer 1/3 of the tumor reflected tumor microenvironment, and size zone variance represented intratumor heterogeneity. Integration of 31 selected radiomics features with clinicopathological variables led to better discrimination performance.Radiomics approach in lung adenocarcinoma enables utilization of the full potential of medical imaging and has potential to improve prognosis assessment in clinical oncology.Two radiomics features were prognostic for lung cancer survival at multivariate analysis: (a) maximum value of the outer one third of the tumor reflects the tumor microenvironment and (b) size zone variance represents the intratumor heterogeneity. Therefore, a radiomics approach in lung adenocarcinoma enables utilization of the full potential of medical imaging and could play a larger role in clinical oncology."
"Despite intensive searches, few proteins involved in telomere homeostasis have been identified in plants. Here, we used pull-down assays to identify potential telomeric interactors in the model plant species Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We identified the candidate protein GH1-HMGA1 (also known as HON4), an uncharacterised linker histone protein of the high mobility group protein A (HMGA) family in plants. HMGAs are architectural transcription factors and have been suggested to function in DNA damage repair, but their precise biological roles remain unclear. Here, we show that GH1-HMGA1 is required for efficient DNA damage repair and telomere integrity in Arabidopsis. GH1-HMGA1 mutants exhibit developmental and growth defects, accompanied by ploidy defects, increased telomere dysfunction-induced foci, mitotic anaphase bridges and degraded telomeres. Furthermore, mutants have a higher sensitivity to genotoxic agents such as Mitomycin C and gamma irradiation. Our work also suggests that GH1-HMGA1 is directly involved in the repair process by allowing completion of homologous recombination."
"Oxidative stress (OS)-induced retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell apoptosis is critically implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. Heterochromatin, a compact and transcriptional inert chromatin structure, has been recently shown to be dynamically regulated in response to stress stimuli. The functional mechanism of heterochromatin on OS exposure is unclear, however. Here we show that OS increases heterochromatin formation both in vivo and in vitro, which is essential for protecting RPE cells from oxidative damage. Mechanistically, OS-induced heterochromatin selectively accumulates at p53-regulated proapoptotic target promoters and inhibits their transcription. Furthermore, OS-induced desumoylation of p53 promotes p53-heterochromatin interaction and regulates p53 promoter selection, resulting in the locus-specific recruitment of heterochromatin and transcription repression. Together, our findings demonstrate a protective function of OS-induced heterochromatin formation in which p53 desumoylation-guided promoter selection and subsequent heterochromatin recruitment play a critical role. We propose that targeting heterochromatin provides a plausible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AMD."
"As a central hub of cellular metabolism and signaling, the mitochondrion is a crucial organelle whose dysfunction can cause disease and whose activity is intimately connected to aging. We review how the mitochondrial network maintains proteomic integrity, how mitochondrial proteotoxic stress is communicated and resolved in the context of the entire cell, and how mitochondrial systems function in the context of organismal health and aging. A deeper understanding of how mitochondrial protein quality control mechanisms are coordinated across these distinct biological levels should help explain why these mechanisms fail with age and, ultimately, how routes to intervention might be attained."
"Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (HME) is a pediatric disorder caused by heparan sulfate (HS) deficiency and is characterized by growth plate-associated osteochondromas. Previously, we found that osteochondroma formation in mouse models is preceded by ectopic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in the perichondrium, but the mechanistic relationships between BMP signaling and HS deficiency remain unclear. Therefore, we used an HS antagonist (Surfen) to investigate the effects of this HS interference on BMP signaling, ligand availability, cell surface BMP receptor (BMPR) dynamics and BMPR interactions in Ad-293 and C3H/10T1/2 cells. As observed previously, the HS interference rapidly increased phosphorylated SMAD family member 1/5/8 levels. FACS analysis and immunoblots revealed that the cells possessed appreciable levels of endogenous cell surface BMP2/4 that were unaffected by the HS antagonist, suggesting that BMP2/4 proteins remained surface bound but became engaged in BMPR interactions and SMAD signaling. Indeed, surface mobility of Snap-tagged BMPRII, measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), was modulated during the drug treatment. This suggested that the receptors had transitioned to lipid rafts acting as signaling centers, confirmed for BMPRII via ultracentrifugation to separate membrane subdomains. In situ proximity ligation assays disclosed that the HS interference rapidly stimulates BMPRI-BMPRII interactions, measured by oligonucleotide-driven amplification signals. Our in vitro studies reveal that cell-associated HS controls BMP ligand availability and BMPR dynamics, interactions and signaling, and largely restrains these processes. We propose that HS deficiency in HME may lead to extensive local BMP signaling and altered BMPR dynamics, triggering excessive cellular responses and osteochondroma formation."
"Phytochromes are photoreceptors in plants, fungi, and various microorganisms and cycle between metastable red light-absorbing (Pr) and far-red light-absorbing (Pfr) states. Their light responses are thought to follow a conserved structural mechanism that is triggered by isomerization of the chromophore. Downstream structural changes involve refolding of the so-called tongue extension of the phytochrome-specific GAF-related (PHY) domain of the photoreceptor. The tongue is connected to the chromophore by conserved DIP and PRxSF motifs and a conserved tyrosine, but the role of these residues in signal transduction is not clear. Here, we examine the tongue interactions and their interplay with the chromophore by substituting the conserved tyrosine (Tyr-263) in the phytochrome from the extremophile bacteriumDeinococcus radioduranswith phenylalanine. Using optical and FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray solution scattering, and crystallography of chromophore-binding domain (CBD) and CBD-PHY fragments, we show that the absence of the Tyr-263 hydroxyl destabilizes the ?-sheet conformation of the tongue. This allowed the phytochrome to adopt an ?-helical tongue conformation regardless of the chromophore state, hence distorting the activity state of the protein. Our crystal structures further revealed that water interactions are missing in the Y263F mutant, correlating with a decrease of the photoconversion yield and underpinning the functional role of Tyr-263 in phytochrome conformational changes. We propose a model in which isomerization of the chromophore, refolding of the tongue, and globular conformational changes are represented as weakly coupled equilibria. The results also suggest that the phytochromes have several redundant signaling routes."
"The photosynthetic chloroplast thylakoid membrane of higher plants is a complex three-dimensional structure that is morphologically dynamic on a timescale of just a few minutes. The membrane dynamics are driven by the phosphorylation of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) by the STN7 kinase, which controls the size of the stacked grana region relative to the unstacked stromal lamellae region. Here, I hypothesise that the functional significance of these membrane dynamics is in controlling the partition of electrons between photosynthetic linear and cyclic electron transfer (LET and CET), which determines the ratio of NADPH/ATP produced. The STN7 kinase responds to the metabolic state of the chloroplast by sensing the stromal redox state. A high NADPH/ATP ratio leads to reduction of thioredoxin f (TRXf), which reduces a CxxxC motif in the stromal domain of STN7 leading to its inactivation, whereas a low NADPH/ATP ratio leads to oxidation of TRXfand STN7 activation. Phosphorylation of LHCII leads to smaller grana, which favour LET by speeding up diffusion of electron carriers plastoquinone (PQ) and plastocyanin (PC) between the domains. In contrast, dephosphorylation of LHCII leads to larger grana that slow the diffusion of PQ and PC, leaving the PQ pool in the stroma more oxidised, thus enhancing the efficiency of CET. The feedback regulation of electron transfer by the downstream metabolism is crucial to plant fitness, since perturbations in the NADPH/ATP ratio can rapidly lead to the inhibition of photosynthesis and photo-oxidative stress."
"During locomotion, each step generates a shock wave that travels through the body toward the head. Without mechanisms for attenuation, repeated shocks can lead to pathology. Shock attenuation (SA) in the lower limb has been well studied, but little is known about how posture affects SA in the spine. To test the hypothesis that lumbar lordosis (LL) contributes to SA, 27 adults (14 male, 13 female) walked and ran on a treadmill. Two lightweight, tri-axial accelerometers were affixed to the skin overlying T12/L1 and L5/S1. Sagittal plane accelerations were analyzed using power spectral density analysis, and lumbar SA was assessed within the impact-related frequency range. 3-D kinematics quantified dynamic and resting LL. To examine the effects of intervertebral discs on spinal SA, supine MRI scans were used to measure disc morphology. Results showed no associations between LL and SA during walking, but LL correlated with SA during running (p<0.01, R2=0.30) resulting in as much as 64% reduction in shock signal power among individuals with the highest LL. Patterns of lumbar spinal motion partially explain differences in SA: larger amplitudes of LL angular displacement and slower angular displacement velocity during running were associated with greater lumbar SA (p=0.008, R2=0.41). Intervertebral discs were associated with greater SA during running (p=0.02, R2=0.22), but after controlling for disc thickness, LL remained strongly associated with SA (p=0.001, R2=0.44). These findings support the hypothesis that LL plays an important role in attenuating impact shocks transmitted through the human spine during high-impact, dynamic activities such as running."
"The highly plastic nature of adrenal cortex suggests the presence of adrenocortical stem cells (ACSC) but the exact in vivo identity of ACSC remains elusive. A few studies have demonstrated the differentiation of adipose or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into steroid-producing cells. We therefore investigated the isolation of multipotent MSC from human adrenal cortex.Human adrenals were obtained as discarded surgical material. Single cell suspensions from human adrenal cortex (n=3) were cultured onto either complete growth medium (CM) or mesenchymal stem cell growth promotion medium (MGPM) in hypoxic condition. Following ex-vivo expansion, their multilineage differentiation capacity was evaluated. Phenotype markers were analysed by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry for cell-surface antigens associated with bone marrow-MSCs and adrenocortical-specific phenotype. Expression of mRNAs for pluripotency markers was assessed by qPCR.The formation of colony forming unit-fibroblasts comprising of adherent cells with fibroblast-like morphology were observed from the monolayer cell culture, in both CM and MGPM. Cells derived from MGPM revealed differentiation toward osteogenic and adipogenic cell lineages. These cells expressed cell-surface MSC markers (CD44, CD90, CD105 and CD166) but did not express the haematopoietic, lymphocytic or HLA-DR markers. Flow cytometry demonstrated significantly higher expression of GLI1 in cell population harvested from MGPM, which were highly proliferative. They also exhibited increased expression of the pluripotency markers.Our study demonstrates that human adrenal cortex harbours a mesenchymal stem cell like population. Understanding the cell biology of adrenal-cortex derived MSCs will inform regenerative medicine approaches in autoimmune Addison's disease."
"Structurally and genetically, human herpesviruses are among the largest and most complex of viruses. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) with an optimized image reconstruction strategy, we report the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) capsid structure at 3.1 angstroms, which is built up of about 3000 proteins organized into three types of hexons (central, peripentonal, and edge), pentons, and triplexes. Both hexons and pentons contain the major capsid protein, VP5; hexons also contain a small capsid protein, VP26; and triplexes comprise VP23 and VP19C. Acting as core organizers, VP5 proteins form extensive intermolecular networks, involving multiple disulfide bonds (about 1500 in total) and noncovalent interactions, with VP26 proteins and triplexes that underpin capsid stability and assembly. Conformational adaptations of these proteins induced by their microenvironments lead to 46 different conformers that assemble into a massive quasisymmetric shell, exemplifying the structural and functional complexity of HSV."
"Endolysosomes can be damaged by diverse materials. Terminally damaged compartments are degraded by lysophagy, but pathways that repair salvageable organelles are poorly understood. Here we found that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, known to mediate budding and fission on endolysosomes, also plays an essential role in their repair. ESCRTs were rapidly recruited to acutely injured endolysosomes through a pathway requiring calcium and ESCRT-activating factors that was independent of lysophagy. We used live-cell imaging to demonstrate that ESCRTs responded to small perforations in endolysosomal membranes and enabled compartments to recover from limited damage. Silica crystals that disrupted endolysosomes also triggered ESCRT recruitment. ESCRTs thus provide a defense against endolysosomal damage likely to be relevant in physiological and pathological contexts."
"Here, we report the genome sequence of wood-decaying white-rot fungusPhlebia centrifugastrain FBCC195, isolated from Norway spruce (Picea abies) in Finnish Lapland. The 34.66-Mb genome containing 13,785 gene models is similar to the genome length reported for other saprobic white-rot species."

"In the central nervous system, oligodendroglial expression of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) is crucial for the assembly and structure of the myelin sheath. MBP synthesis is tightly regulated in space and time, particularly on the post-transcriptional level. We have identified the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 (alias p68) in a complex withMbpmRNA in oligodendroglial cells. Expression of DDX5 is highest in progenitor cells and immature oligodendrocytes, where it localizes to heterogeneous populations of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes associated withMbpmRNA in the cell body and processes. Manipulation of DDX5 protein amounts inversely affects levels of MBP protein. We present evidence that DDX5 is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of MBP protein synthesis, with implications for oligodendroglial development. In addition, DDX5 knockdown results in an increased abundance of MBP exon 2-positive isoforms in immature oligodendrocytes, most likely by regulating alternative splicing ofMbpOur findings contribute to the understanding of the complex nature of MBP post-transcriptional control in immature oligodendrocytes where DDX5 appears to affect the abundance of MBP proteins via distinct but converging mechanisms."
"Loss-of-function mutations inPPARGcause familial partial lipodystrophy type 3 (FPLD3) and severe metabolic disease in many cases. Missense mutations inPPARGare present in ?1:500 people. Whilst mutations are often binarily classified as 'benign' or 'deleterious', prospective functional classification of all missensePPARGvariants suggests that their impact is graded. Furthermore, in testing novel mutations with both prototypic 'endogenous' (e.g. prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2)) and synthetic ligands (thiazolidinediones, tyrosine agonists), we observed that synthetic agonists selectively rescue function of some PPAR? mutants. Here, we report FPLD3 patients, harbouring two such PPAR? mutations (R308P, A261E). Both PPAR? mutants exhibit negligible constitutive or PGJ2-induced transcriptional activity but respond readily to synthetic agonistsin vitro, with structural modelling providing a basis for such differential ligand-dependent responsiveness. Concordant with this, dramatic clinical improvement was seen following pioglitazone treatment of the patient with R308P mutant PPAR?. A patient with A261E mutant PPAR? also responded beneficially to rosiglitazone, though cardiomyopathy precluded prolonged thiazolidinedione use. These observations indicate that detailed structural and functional classification can be used to inform therapeutic decisions in patients withPPARGmutations."
"Type I interferon (IFN-I) is a class of antiviral immunomodulatory cytokines involved in many stages of tumor initiation and progression. IFN-I acts directly on tumor cells to inhibit cell growth, and indirectly by activating immune cells to mount antitumor responses. To understand the role of endogenous IFN-I in spontaneous, oncogene-driven carcinogenesis, we characterized tumors arising in Her2/neu transgenic (neuT) mice carrying a nonfunctional mutation in the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1). Such mice are unresponsive to this family of cytokines. Compared to parental neu+/- mice (neuT mice), IFNAR1-/- neu+/- mice (IFNAR-neuT mice) showed earlier onset and increased tumor multiplicity with marked vascularization. IFNAR-neuT tumors exhibited deregulation of genes having adverse prognostic value in breast cancer patients, including the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) marker aldehyde dehydrogenase-1A1 (ALDH1A1). An increased number of BCSCs were observed in IFNAR-neuT tumors, as assessed by ALDH1A1 enzymatic activity, clonogenic assay, and tumorigenic capacity. In vitro exposure of neuT+ mammospheres and cell lines to antibodies to IFN-I resulted in increased frequency of ALDH+ cells, suggesting that IFN-I controls stemness in tumor cells. Altogether, these results reveal a role of IFN-I in NeuT-driven spontaneous carcinogenesis through intrinsic control of BCSCs."
"Detection of microbial DNA is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that alerts the host immune system to mount a defense response to microbial infections. However, this detection mechanism also poses a challenge to the host as to how to distinguish foreign DNA from abundant self-DNA. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) synthase (cGAS) is a DNA sensor that triggers innate immune responses through production of the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which binds and activates the adaptor protein STING. However, cGAS can be activated by double-stranded DNA irrespective of the sequence, including self-DNA. Although how cGAS is normally kept inactive in cells is still not well understood, recent research has provided strong evidence that genomic DNA damage leads to cGAS activation to stimulate inflammatory responses. This review summarizes recent findings on how genomic instability and DNA damage trigger cGAS activation and how cGAS serves as a link from DNA damage to inflammation, cellular senescence, and cancer."
"Insulin is the paramount anabolic hormone, promoting carbon energy deposition in the body. Its synthesis, quality control, delivery, and action are exquisitely regulated by highly orchestrated intracellular mechanisms in different organs or ""stations"" of its bodily journey. In thisBeyond the Cellreview, we focus on these five stages of the journey of insulin through the body and the captivating cell biology that underlies the interaction of insulin with each organ. We first analyze insulin's biosynthesis in and export from the ?-cells of the pancreas. Next, we focus on its first pass and partial clearance in the liver with its temporality and periodicity linked to secretion. Continuing the journey, we briefly describe insulin's action on the blood vasculature and its still-debated mechanisms of exit from the capillary beds. Once in the parenchymal interstitium of muscle and adipose tissue, insulin promotes glucose uptake into myofibers and adipocytes, and we elaborate on the intricate signaling and vesicle traffic mechanisms that underlie this fundamental function. Finally, we touch upon the renal degradation of insulin to end its action. Cellular discernment of insulin's availability and action should prove critical to understanding its pivotal physiological functions and how their failure leads to diabetes."
"Recently, we have demonstrated that acute glucosamine-induced augmentation of protein O-linked ?-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) levels inhibits inflammation in isolated vascular smooth muscle cells and neointimal formation in a rat model of carotid injury by interfering with NF-?B (nuclear factor-?B) signaling. However, the specific molecular target for O-GlcNAcylation that is responsible for glucosamine-induced vascular protection remains unclear. In this study, we test the hypothesis that increased A20 O-GlcNAcylation is required for glucosamine-mediated inhibition of inflammation and vascular protection.In cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells, both glucosamine and the selective O-linked N-acetylglucosaminidase inhibitor thiamet G significantly increased A20 O-GlcNAcylation. Thiamet G treatment did not increase A20 protein expression but did significantly enhance binding to TAX1BP1, a key regulatory protein for A20 activity. Adenovirus-mediated A20 overexpression further enhanced the effects of thiamet G on prevention of TNF-? (tumor necrosis factor-?)-induced I?B degradation, p65 phosphorylation, and increases in DNA-binding activity. A20 overexpression enhanced the inhibitory effects of thiamet G on TNF-?-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression and vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, whereas silencing endogenous A20 by transfection of specific A20 shRNA significantly attenuated these inhibitory effects. In balloon-injured rat carotid arteries, glucosamine treatment markedly inhibited neointimal formation and p65 activation compared with vehicle treatment. Adenoviral delivery of A20 shRNA to the injured arteries dramatically reduced balloon injury-induced A20 expression and inflammatory response compared with scramble shRNA and completely abolished the vascular protection of glucosamine.These results suggest that O-GlcNAcylation of A20 plays a key role in the negative regulation of NF-?B signaling cascades in TNF-?-treated vascular smooth muscle cells in culture and in acutely injured arteries, thus protecting against inflammation-induced vascular injury."
"Members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins function as adapters/modulators that recognize phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-based binding motifs in many intracellular proteins and play fundamental roles in signal transduction pathways of eukaryotic cells. In platelets, 14-3-3 plays a wide range of regulatory roles in phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways, including G-protein signaling, cAMP signaling, agonist-induced phosphatidyl-serine (PS) exposure and regulation of mitochondrial function. In particular, 14-3-3 inter-acts with several phosphoserine-dependent binding sites in the major platelet adhesion re-ceptor, the glycoprotein Ib-IX complex (GPIb-IX), regulating its interaction with von Wil-lebrand factor (VWF) and mediating VWF/GPIb-IX-dependent mechano-signal transduc-tion leading to platelet activation. The interaction of 14-3-3 with GPIb-IX also plays a crit-ical role in enabling the platelet response to low concentrations of thrombin through coop-erative signaling mediated by protease-activated receptors (PARs) and GPIb-IX. The vari-ous functions of 14-3-3 in platelets suggest that it is a possible target for the treatment of thrombosis and inflammation."
"Breast cancers detected after a negative breast screening examination and prior to the next screening are referred to as interval cancers. These cancers generally have poor clinical characteristics compared to screen-detected cancers, but associations between interval cancer and genomic cancer characteristics are not well understood. Mammographically-screened women diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer from 1993-2013 (n=370) were identified by linking the Carolina Breast Cancer Study and the Carolina Mammography Registry. Among women with a registry-identified screening mammogram 0-24 months before diagnosis, cancers were classified as screen-detected (N=165) or interval-detected (N=205). Using logistic regression, we examined the association of mode of detection with cancer characteristics (clinical, IHC, and genomic), overall, and in analyses stratified on mammographic density and race. Interval cancer was associated with large tumors (> 2 cm) (OR=2.3; 95% C.I.: 1.5, 3.7), positive nodal status (OR=1.8; 95% C.I.: 1.1, 2.8), and triple negative subtype (OR=2.5; 95% C.I.: 1.1, 5.5). Interval cancers were more likely to have non-Luminal A subtype (OR=2.9; 95% C.I.: 1.5, 5.7), while screen-detected cancers tended to be more indolent (96% had low risk of recurrence genomic scores; 71% were PAM50 Luminal A). When stratifying by mammographic density and race, associations between interval detection and poor prognostic features were similar by race and density status. Strong associations between interval cancers and poor-prognosis genomic features (non-Luminal A subtype and high risk of recurrence score) suggest that aggressive tumor biology is an important contributor to interval cancer rates."
"Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors are at risk for uveitis during convalescence. Vision loss has been observed following uveitis due to cataracts. Since Ebola virus (EBOV) may persist in the ocular fluid of EVD survivors for an unknown duration, there are questions about the safety and feasibility of vision restorative cataract surgery in EVD survivors.We conducted a cross-sectional study of EVD survivors anticipating cataract surgery and patients with active uveitis to evaluate EBOV RNA persistence in ocular fluid, as well as vision outcomes post cataract surgery. Patients with aqueous humor that tested negative for EBOV RNA were eligible to proceed with manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS).We screened 137 EVD survivors from June 2016 - August 2017 for enrolment. We enrolled 50 EVD survivors; 46 with visually significant cataract, 1 with a subluxated lens, 2 with active uveitis and 1 with a blind painful eye due to uveitis. The median age was 24.0years (IQR 17-35) and 35 patients (70%) were female. The median logMAR visual acuity (VA) was 3.0 (Snellen VA Hand motions; Interquartile Range, IQR: 1.2-3.0, Snellen VA 20/320 - Hand motions). All patients tested negative for EBOV RNA by RT-PCR in aqueous humor/vitreous fluid and conjunctiva at a median of 19months (IQR 18-20) from EVD diagnosis in Phase 1 of ocular fluid sampling and 34months (IQR 32-36) from EVD diagnosis in Phase 2 of ocular fluid sampling. Thirty-four patients underwent MSICS, with a preoperative median VA improvement from hand motions to 20/30 at three-month postoperative follow-up (P<0.001).EBOV persistence by RT-PCR was not identified in ocular fluid or conjunctivae of fifty EVD survivors with ocular disease. Cataract surgery can be performed safely with vision restorative outcomes in patients who test negative for EBOV RNA in ocular fluid specimens. These findings impact the thousands of West African EVD survivors at-risk for ocular complications who may also require eye surgery during EVD convalescence."
"Owing to the spread of multidrug resistance (MDR) and extensive drug resistance (XDR), there is a pressing need to identify potential targets for the development of more-effective anti-M. tuberculosis (Mtb) drugs. PafA, as the sole Prokaryotic Ubiquitin-like Protein ligase in the Pup-proteasome System (PPS) of Mtb, is an attractive drug target. Here, we show that the activity of purified Mtb PafA is significantly inhibited upon the association of AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride) to PafA residue Serine 119 (S119). Mutation of S119 to amino acids that resemble AEBSF has similar inhibitory effects on the activity of purified Mtb PafA. Structural analysis reveals that although S119 is distant from the PafA catalytic site, it is located at a critical position in the groove where PafA binds the C-terminal region of Pup. Phenotypic studies demonstrate that S119 plays critical roles in the function of Mtb PafA when tested in M. smegmatis. Our study suggests that targeting S119 is a promising direction for developing an inhibitor of M. tuberculosis PafA."
"The immunomodulatory property of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) exosomes is well documented. On the basis of our previous report that MSC exosomes increased regulatory T-cell (Treg) production in mice with allogenic skin graft but not in ungrafted mice, we hypothesize that an activated immune system is key to exosome-mediated Treg production.To test our hypothesis, MSC exosomes were incubated with mouse spleen CD4+T cells that were activated with either anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs or allogenic antigen-presenting cell (APC)-enriched spleen CD11c+cells to determine whether production of mouse CD4+CD25+T cells or CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs could be induced. MSC exosomes were also administered to the lethal chimeric human-SCID mouse model of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in which human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were infused into irradiated NSG mice to induce GVHD.We report here that MSC exosome-induced production of CD4+CD25+T cells or CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs from CD4+T cells activated by allogeneic APC-enriched CD11C+cells but not those activated by anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs. This induction was exosome- and APC dose-dependent. In the mouse GVHD model in which GVHD was induced by transplanted human APC-stimulated human anti-mouse CD4+T cell effectors, MSC exosome alleviated GVHD symptoms and increased survival. Surviving exosome-treated mice had a significantly higher level of human CD4+CD25+CD127low/-Tregs than surviving mice treated with Etanercept, a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor.MSC exosome enhanced Treg production in vitro and in vivo through an APC-mediated pathway."
"Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic members of type I innate lymphocytes (ILC1) with a prominent role in anti-tumor and anti-viral immune responses. Despite the increasing insight into NK cell biology, the steps and stages leading to mature circulating NK cells require further investigation. Natural killer cell development and functional maturation are complex and multi-stage processes that occur predominantly in the bone marrow (BM) and originate from haematopoietic stem cells CD34+(HSC). Within the BM, NK cell precursor (NKP) and NK cell development intermediates reside in specialized niches that are characterized by particular cellular components that provide signals required for their maturation. These signals consist of soluble factors or direct cellular-contact interactions mediated by cytokines and growth factors with complementary, as well as overlapping roles in distinct developmental steps. Emerging evidence highlights the plasticity of the early phase of NK cell development, and the capacity of different signal combinations to redirect precursor lineage commitment through other innate cell populations. Here, we summarize the role of signals known to guide NK cell differentiation with a particular focus on the cytokines and the receptor/ligand pairs playing a critical role in these processes. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying NK cell development will elucidate their roles in pathological conditions and will improve protocols for NK cell therapeutic application."
"We analyzed 921 adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum to examine shared and distinguishing molecular characteristics of gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas (GIACs). Hypermutated tumors were distinct regardless of cancer type and comprised those enriched for insertions/deletions, representing microsatellite instability cases with epigenetic silencing of MLH1 in the context of CpG island methylator phenotype, plus tumors with elevated single-nucleotide variants associated with mutations in POLE. Tumors with chromosomal instability were diverse, with gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas harboring fragmented genomes associated with genomic doubling and distinct mutational signatures. We identified a group of tumors in the colon and rectum lacking hypermutation and aneuploidy termed genome stable and enriched in DNA hypermethylation and mutations in KRAS, SOX9, and PCBP1."
"We characterized the epigenetic landscape of genes encoding long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) across 6,475 tumors and 455 cancer cell lines. In stark contrast to the CpG island hypermethylation phenotype in cancer, we observed a recurrent hypomethylation of 1,006 lncRNA genes in cancer, including EPIC1 (epigenetically-induced lncRNA1). Overexpression of EPIC1 is associated with poor prognosis in luminal B breast cancer patients and enhances tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, EPIC1 promotes cell-cycle progression by interacting with MYC through EPIC1's 129-283 nt region. EPIC1 knockdown reduces the occupancy of MYC to its target genes (e.g., CDKN1A, CCNA2, CDC20, and CDC45). MYC depletion abolishes EPIC1's regulation of MYC target and luminal breast cancer tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo."
"We analyzed molecular data on 2,579 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) of four gynecological types plus breast. Our aims were to identify shared and unique molecular features, clinically significant subtypes, and potential therapeutic targets. We found 61 somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) and 46 significantly mutated genes (SMGs). Eleven SCNAs and 11 SMGs had not been identified in previous TCGA studies of the individual tumor types. We found functionally significant estrogen receptor-regulated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and gene/lncRNA interaction networks. Pathway analysis identified subtypes with high leukocyte infiltration, raising potential implications for immunotherapy. Using 16 key molecular features, we identified five prognostic subtypes and developed a decision tree that classified patients into the subtypes based on just six features that are assessable in clinical laboratories."
"Although reactive hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) is widely used for assessment of endothelial function, RH index (RHI) cannot be measured in some cases when pulse wave amplitude (PWA) is very low. Decrease in PWA is mainly caused by proper palmar digital artery (PPDA) stenosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between PWA measured by RH-PAT and stenosis of the PPDA measured by digital subtraction angiography and to evaluate the limitation of assessment of endothelial function measured by RHI in patients with PPDA stenosis.We measured baseline PWA in 51 fingers including the first to third fingers of both hands in 10 patients who had PPDA stenosis and in 66 fingers that were the first fingers of both hands in 33 subjects who had no PPDA stenosis. Severe stenosis was defined as over 75% by lower percent diameter stenosis between two PPDAs in a finger.PWA was significantly correlated with stenosis of the digital artery (r=-0.55; P<0.0001). A PWV value of 300mV was the optimal cut-off value for severe stenosis (sensitivity, 84.0%; specificity, 88.5%). Log RHI was significantly lower in patients with PPDA stenosis than in subjects without PPDA stenosis (0.33±0.27 versus 0.73±0.27, P=0.007).RH-PAT may be useful for assessment of not only endothelial function but also PPDA stenosis. RHI may be underestimated in patients with PPDA stenosis. We should pay attention to low baseline PWA when measuring RHI.URL for clinical trial: http://UMIN; registration number for clinical trial: UMIN000003409."
"In the absence of nodal metastasis, pathologic tumor (pT) size remains one of the most important factors in adjuvant treatment decisions and patient prognosis in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of core needle biopsy (CNB) tumor size on final pT stage.Our information system was searched to identify all patients who underwent excisional procedures for invasive breast carcinoma from January 1,2014 to December 31, 2015. The tumor size on CNB and final excision, the number of cases in which the CNB size was larger, and the percentage of cases in which using the CNB tumor size changed the final pT stage were recorded.From 1380 primary breast excisions/mastectomies, a total of 870 cases were included. In 82 (9.4%) the CNB tumor size was larger (63 of 82 cases) or no residual tumor was identified on excision (19 of 82 cases). From these 82 cases, 40 (48.7%) were properly staged on the basis of CNB tumor size, 16 (19.5%) were not staged, and 26 (31.7%) were staged using the final excision tumor size. Change in stage occurred in 7 of these 26 patients.Our study revealed that in most cases, the largest tumor size is found in the excision/mastectomy specimen. However, in 9.4% (82 of 870), the CNB contains the most accurate tumor size for pT staging. On the basis of our results, including the largest linear tumor extent on the CNB report is recommended."
"The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most important infectious cause of congenital abnormalities and also of infectious complications of transplantation. The biology of the infection is complex and acquired immunity does not always prevent reinfection. Nevertheless, vaccine development is far advanced, with numerous candidate vaccines being tested, both live and inactivated. This article summarizes the status of the candidate vaccines."
"The steroidogenic enzyme P450 aromatase (ARO) has a key role in the conversion of testosterone (T) into estrogens (E), expressed as 17?-estradiol. The presence and localization of this key enzyme have not been described before in the South American camelid alpaca (Vicugna pacos). In our previous studies of the expression and biological effects of orexin A (OxA) and OxB on the alpaca testis demonstrated that OxA, via its specific receptor 1 (OX1R), stimulated T synthesis. In order to extend these findings, we presently explored the presence and localization of ARO in the alpaca male gonad, and the possible correlation between ARO and the orexinergic complex. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of ARO in tissue homogenates and its localization in the tubular and interstitial compartments of the alpaca testis, respectively. The addition of OxA to fresh testicular slices decreased the 17?-estradiol E levels. This effect was annulled by the sequential addition of the selective OX1R antagonist, SB-408124. OxB incubation did not have any effect on the biosynthesis of E. Furthermore, the OxA-mediated down-regulation of E secretion could be ascribed to ARO inhibition by exogenous OxA, as indicated by measurement of ARO activity in tissue slices incubated with OxA. Overall, our findings suggest that locally secreted OxA interacting with OX1R could indirectly inhibit ARO activity, disabling the conversion of T to E, and consequently lowering E biosynthesis and increasing the production of T in mammalian testis."
"Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) is a novel methodological tool that integrates multiple different types of data to identify homogeneous subsets of patients in whom disease classification may be otherwise unclear or challenging. In this review article, the authors hope to provide insight into how SNF can be used in clinical decision making where the aim is to have little influence on the data prior to obtaining the results of the analysis."
"The most important function of the placenta is the exchange of nutrients and oxygen between a mother and her fetus. To establish a healthy functioning placenta, placentation needs to occur with adequate remodelling of spiral arteries by extravillous trophoblasts. When this process is impaired, the resulting suboptimal and inadequate placenta function results in the manifestation of pregnancy complications. Impaired placenta function can cause preeclampsia and leads to fetal growth restriction due to hypoxia. Presence of hypoxia leads to oxidative stress due to an imbalance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidants, thereby causing damage to proteins, lipids and DNA. In the placenta, signs of morphological adaptation in response to hypoxia can be found. Different placental lesions like maternal or fetal vascular malperfusion or chronic villitis lead to a decreased exchange of oxygen between the mother and the fetus. Clinically, several biomarkers indicative for oxidative stress, e.g. malondialdehyde and reduced levels of free thiols are found. This review aims to give an overview of the causes and (potential) role of placental oxidative stress in the development of placental parenchymal pathology and its clinical consequences. Also, therapeutic options aiming at prevention or treatment of hypoxia of the placenta and fetus are described."
"In this study cold low pressure radiofrequency oxygen plasma was used for the first time to inactivate toxicogenic fungi proliferation on saffron. Varieties of plasma produced reactive oxygen species which were investigated by optical emission spectroscopy. The data were indicative of the absence of UV radiation. Effects of plasma treatment on antioxidant activity, metabolic content, colour, odour and flavour parameters and physical impact on saffron were investigated. A range of plasma powers and exposure times were assayed in suppression of fungal growth. Amongst which power of 60?W for 15?min was used to eradicate Aspergillus and other microorganisms. The ferric reducing antioxidant power was changed from 1778.21 to 1674.25?mM/g dry weight following plasma treatment. Moreover, crocin ester, picrocrocin and safranal metabolites reduced insignificantly. Additionally, plasma had no significant impact on colour, odour and flavour of saffron."
"A very high pullulan producing yeast-like fungus, Aureobasidium melanogenum TN1-2 isolated from a natural honey was found to be able to produce 97.0?g/L of pullulan from 140.0?g/L sucrose at a flask level while it could yield 114.0?g/L of pullulan within 134?h during a 10-liter fermentation, the yield was 0.81?g/g and the productivity was 0.86?g/L/h. The high ability to biosynthesize pullulan by this yeast-like fungal strain TN1-2 was related to high glucosyltransferase activity, high phosphofructo-2-kinase activity, high content of its cellular glycerol and low glucose repressor. The Mw of the produced pullulan was 1.42?×?105?g/mol. The low Mw may be due to the high ?-amylase, glucoamylase and isopullulanase activities. The intracellular level of trehalose had no influence on high pullulan production by the yeast-like fungal strain TN1-2."
"The quality characteristics of waxy and non-waxy proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) are different because of their varying amylose content. Physical appearance, pasting properties, cooking and edibility were investigated in five waxy and five non-waxy proso millet varieties. The results showed that the amylose content of proso millet flour was positively correlated with peak viscosity, trough viscosity, breakdown viscosity, final viscosity, setback viscosity, peak time, and pasting temperature. The porridge made with non-waxy proso millet was thicker as compared with that of made with waxy proso millet. Cooked non-waxy proso millet was hard whereas waxy proso millet was sticky. The non-waxy proso millet contained higher resistant starch and lower rapidly digestible starch than waxy proso millet. From this study, we can conclude that quality characteristics of waxy and non-waxy proso millet are different, and this may provide an insight in food processing and commercial production of proso millet."
"The quality of zein (Z)- and zein-tannic acid (ZTA)-coated guavas was monitored throughout 12?days of storage. Coated fruit showed lower changes in terms of visual appearance, chlorophyll contents and color. Weight loss, softening, and changes in soluble solids were also decreased by the coatings. The respiration peak as well as H2O2and superoxide dismutase activity peaks were delayed by the coatings, and the ethylene production was reduced. So, the results were consistent with a slowed down ripening of guavas by the coatings, which was probably related to lowered oxygen permeability of guava skin. ZTA coating was more effective than Z to reduce weight loss, softening, color changes, ethylene production, and oxidative stress. The higher efficiency of ZTA coating was ascribed to zein crosslinking, which probably resulted in decreased gas permeability, promoting lower respiration rates and lower ROS production, slowing down the ripening process, and extending guava stability."
"In order to develop an accurate and precise determination method based on solid phase extraction of Pb(II) in food and water samples, a hybrid monolithic column based on layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets-alginate hydrogel has been synthesized. Combining the advantages of porous 3D framework of hydrogel with selective adsorption of LDHs toward Pb(II), the hydrogel-based hybrid monolithic column shows enhanced enrichment selectivity and efficiency for target ions. Effects of hydrogel composition, pH, concentration and type of eluent, sample volume, and interfering ions on the recoveries of the analytes were also investigated. Under the optimal experiment conditions of method, the limit of detection, preconcentration factor and precision as RSD% are found to be 0.39??g?L-1, 53.7 and 2.65%, respectively. Trace Pb(II) can be quantitatively preconcentrated at pH 6.0 with recoveries >97%. Finally, the method was successfully verified by analyzing spiked Pb2+in water and drinking samples."
"Breast MR imaging and molecular breast imaging (MBI) are functional imaging modalities that can be used to noninvasively evaluate the pathophysiology and biology of breast cancer. In the era of personalized medicine, these imaging techniques give clinicians insight into cancer pathobiology and allows them to individualize treatment regimens. Breast MR imaging has gained acceptance for breast cancer evaluation; work is ongoing on validation of MBI for breast cancer evaluation. This article discusses clinical applications of breast MR imaging and MBI, and compares the performance of these techniques in breast cancer screening, diagnosis, staging, and treatment response evaluation."
"The taxon Tardigrada, commonly called ""water bears"", consists of microscopic, eight-legged invertebrates that are well known for their ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions. Their miniscule body size means that tardigrades possess a small total number of cells, the number and arrangement of which may be highly conserved in some organs. Although mitoses have been observed in several organs, the rate and pattern of cell divisions in adult tardigrades has never been characterized. In this study, we incubated live tardigrades over a period of several days with a thymidine analog in order to visualize all cells that had divided during this time. We focus on the midgut, the largest part of the digestive system. Our results show that new cells in the midgut arise from the anterior and posterior ends of this organ and either migrate or divide toward its middle. These cells divide at a constant rate and all cells of the midgut epithelium are replaced in approximately one week. On the other hand, we found no cell divisions in the nervous system or any other major organs, suggesting that the cell turnover of these organs may be extremely slow or dependent on changing environmental conditions."
"The epidermis of Tarentola mauritanica in the skin regions of back, flank and belly has been described using light and electron microscopy. This animal model was useful to give an insight of the functional pattern involved in pigmentation, cryptism and photosensitivity. Skin from back and flanks, in electron microscopy, shows a high concentration of chromatophores, among those melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores have been reported. Interestingly, in the flank-back transition region electron microscopy reveals the presence of nerve endings. Our contribution adds new knowledge about the skin of this species, and it could be useful to study in deep the mechanism of cryptic colour change in reptiles."
"Short nucleic acid oligomers have found a wide range of applications in experimental physics, biology and medicine, and show potential for the treatment of acquired and genetic diseases. These applications rely heavily on the predictability of hybridization through Watson-Crick base pairing to allow positioning on a nanometer scale, as well as binding to the target transcripts, but also off-target binding to transcripts with partial homology. These effects are of particular importance in the development of therapeutic oligonucleotides, where off-target effects caused by the binding of mismatched sequences need to be avoided.We employ a novel method of probing DNA hybridization using optically active DNA-stabilized silver clusters (Ag-DNA) to measure binding efficiencies through a change in fluorescence intensity. In this way we can determine their location-specific sensitivity to individual mismatches in the sequence. The results reveal a strong dependence of the hybridization on the location of the mismatch, whereby mismatches close to the edges and center show a relatively minor impact. In parallel, we propose a simple model for calculating the annealing ratios of mismatched DNA sequences, which supports our experimental results.The primary result shown in this work is a demonstration of a novel technique to measure DNA hybridization using fluorescent Ag-DNA. With this technique, we investigated the effect of mismatches on the hybridization efficiency, and found a significant dependence on the location of individual mismatches. These effects are strongly influenced by the length of the used oligonucleotides. The novel probe method based on fluorescent Ag-DNA functions as a reliable tool in measuring this behavior. As a secondary result, we formulated a simple model that is consistent with the experimental data."
"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide powerful models for studying cellular differentiations and unlimited sources of cells for regenerative medicine. However, a comprehensive single-cell level differentiation roadmap for hPSCs has not been achieved.We use high throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), based on optimized microfluidic circuits, to profile early differentiation lineages in the human embryoid body system. We present a cellular-state landscape for hPSC early differentiation that covers multiple cellular lineages, including neural, muscle, endothelial, stromal, liver, and epithelial cells. Through pseudotime analysis, we construct the developmental trajectories of these progenitor cells and reveal the gene expression dynamics in the process of cell differentiation. We further reprogram primed H9 cells into naïve-like H9 cells to study the cellular-state transition process. We find that genes related to hemogenic endothelium development are enriched in naïve-like H9. Functionally, naïve-like H9 show higher potency for differentiation into hematopoietic lineages than primed cells.Our single-cell analysis reveals the cellular-state landscape of hPSC early differentiation, offering new insights that can be harnessed for optimization of differentiation protocols."
"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women worldwide and leading cause of cancer deaths indeveloping countries. There is very limited data on BC in the Central African Republic. The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiological and histopathological characteristics of BC in Bangui.This retrospective study reviewed cancer data registries and medical records from the Pathology Unit of the National Laboratory in Bangui and the General Surgery and Gyneacology service from 2003 to 2015. A questionnaire was designed to collect information and data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods.In total, 174 cases of BC were recorded, with an average annual frequency of13.4 cases per year. The age of the women at diagnosis varied from 16 to 90 years with a median of 45.5 years and InterQuartile range (IQR) 18 years. The age group of 45-54 years represented the majority of the study population (n =?51, 29.3%).About 25.9%ofthe patients were non-educated and 85.6% lived in cities. Over 48 % of the women were housewives with a moderate economic status (n =?99, 56.9%). Sixty nine percent of the specimens received at the pathology unit were pieces of breast tumour. Invasive ductal carcinoma (n =?113, 64.9%) was the main histological form and most of the tumours were of Grade III (n =?14, 46.7%). The only imaging assessment was ultrasound performed in (n =?53, 30.4%) women. Surgery was performed in (n =?166, 95.4%) patients, while (n =?159, 91.4%) received complementary chemotherapy. At the end of the study, 84.5%of the cases had died, 12.1% were alive and 3.4% were considered ""lost to follow-up"".BC is an important public health problem and affected most of the younger Central African women. Epidemiological and histological characteristics are more or less common to those described other developing countries. It is imperative to improve the awareness of health care institutions and women on the burden of BC, to carry out early screening of BC, and to strengthen the capacity of women's health care system."
"High temperature is a major abiotic stress that limits wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) productivity. Variation in levels of a wide range of lipids, including stress-related molecular species, oxidative damage, cellular organization and ultrastructural changes were analyzed to provide an integrated view of the factors that underlie decreased photosynthetic rate under high temperature stress. Wheat plants of cultivar Chinese Spring were grown at optimum temperatures (25/15 °C, maximum/minimum) until the onset of the booting stage. Thereafter, plants were exposed to high temperature (35/25 °C) for 16 d.Compared with optimum temperature, a lower photosynthetic rate was observed at high temperature which is an interplay between thylakoid membrane damage, thylakoid membrane lipid composition, oxidative damage of cell organelle, and stomatal and non-stomatal limitations. Triacylglycerol levels were higher under high temperature stress. Polar lipid fatty acyl unsaturation was lower at high temperature, while triacylglycerol unsaturation was the same at high temperature and optimum temperature. The changes in lipid species indicates increases in activities of desaturating, oxidizing, glycosylating and acylating enzymes under high temperature stress. Cumulative effect of high temperature stress led to generation of reactive oxygen species, cell organelle and membrane damage, and reduced antioxidant enzyme activity, and imbalance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defense system.Taken together with recent findings demonstrating that reactive oxygen species are formed from and are removed by thylakoid lipids, the data suggest that reactive oxygen species production, reactive oxygen species removal, and changes in lipid metabolism contribute to decreased photosynthetic rate under high temperature stress."
"Twelve months treatment is the current standard of care for adjuvant trastuzumab in patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer however the optimal duration is not known. Persephone is a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial comparing 6- to 12-months of trastuzumab. In this trial there will be a trade-off between a possible small decrease in disease-free survival (DFS) with 6-months and reduced cardiotoxicity and cost.A structured questionnaire asked clinicians who had recruited patients into the Persephone trial about their prior beliefs with regards to the clinical effectiveness of trastuzumab and cardiotoxicity profile, in the comparison of 6- and 12-month durations.Fifty-one clinicians from 40 of the 152 Persephone sites completed the questionnaire. 30/50 responders (60%) believed that 6-months trastuzumab would give the same 4-year DFS rate as 12-months trastuzumab, with 21/50 (42%) holding this belief across all breast cancer subsets. In addition, 46/49 responders (94%) reported expecting to change their clinical practice to 6-months, with their prior beliefs (most commonly 85% 4-year DFS rate with 6-months) being greater than their lowest acceptable rate (most commonly 83% 4-year DFS rate with 6-months). Low levels of cardiotoxicity were expected with both 6 and 12-months trastuzumab, with the majority expecting lower levels with 6-months. With increasing hypothesised differences of cardiotoxicity rates between the two durations, significantly lower levels of 4-year DFS with 6-months trastuzumab were deemed acceptable (p?<?0.0001).Most responders believe that 6-months trastuzumab is adequate, both overall and within each subset of breast cancer, and plan to change their clinical practice if the Persephone results support their prior belief. An individual patient meta-analysis of the duration trials would give greater precision to estimates of the differences in efficacy and toxicity, and adequate statistical power to establish a 2% level of non-inferiority for 6-months adjuvant trastuzumab."
"We and others have previously shown that alterations in the mammalian gut microbiome are associated with diet, notably early life exposure to a maternal high fat diet (HFD). Here, we aimed to further these studies by examining alterations in the gut microbiome of juvenile Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) that were exposed to a maternal HFD, weaned onto a control diet, and later supplemented with a synbiotic comprised of psyllium seed and Enterococcus and Lactobacillus species.Eighteen month old offspring (n?=?7) of 36% HFD fed dams were fed a control (14% fat) diet post weaning, then were synbiotic supplemented for 75 days and longitudinal stool and serum samples were obtained. All stool samples were subjected to 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing, and microbiome profiles and serum lipids and triglycerides were compared to untreated, healthy age matched and diet matched controls (n?=?7). Overall, 16S-based metagenomic analysis revealed that supplementation exerted minimal alterations to the gut microbiome including transient increased abundance of Lactobacillus species and decreased abundance of few bacterial genera, including Faecalibacterium and Anaerovibrio. However, serum lipid analysis revealed significant decreases in triglycerides, cholesterol, and LDL (p?<?0.05). Nevertheless, supplemented juveniles challenged 4 months later were not protected from HFD-induced gut dysbiosis.Synbiotic supplementation is temporally associated with alterations in the gut microbiome and host lipid profiles of juvenile Japanese macaques that were previously exposed to a maternal HFD. Despite these presumptive temporal benefits, a protective effect against later HFD-challenge gut dysbiosis was not observed."
"A strong focus of the post-genomic era is mining of the non-coding regulatory genome in order to unravel the function of regulatory elements that coordinate gene expression (Nat 489:57-74, 2012; Nat 507:462-70, 2014; Nat 507:455-61, 2014; Nat 518:317-30, 2015). Whole-genome approaches based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) have provided insight into the genomic location of regulatory elements throughout different cell types, organs and organisms. These technologies are now widespread and commonly used in laboratories from various fields of research. This highlights the need for fast and user-friendly software tools dedicated to extracting cis-regulatory information contained in these regulatory regions; for instance transcription factor binding site (TFBS) composition. Ideally, such tools should not require prior programming knowledge to ensure they are accessible for all users.We present TrawlerWeb, a web-based version of the Trawler_standalone tool (Nat Methods 4:563-5, 2007; Nat Protoc 5:323-34, 2010), to allow for the identification of enriched motifs in DNA sequences obtained from next-generation sequencing experiments in order to predict their TFBS composition. TrawlerWeb is designed for online queries with standard options common to web-based motif discovery tools. In addition, TrawlerWeb provides three unique new features: 1) TrawlerWeb allows the input of BED files directly generated from NGS experiments, 2) it automatically generates an input-matched biologically relevant background, and 3) it displays resulting conservation scores for each instance of the motif found in the input sequences, which assists the researcher in prioritising the motifs to validate experimentally. Finally, to date, this web-based version of Trawler_standalone remains the fastest online de novo motif discovery tool compared to other popular web-based software, while generating predictions with high accuracy.TrawlerWeb provides users with a fast, simple and easy-to-use web interface for de novo motif discovery. This will assist in rapidly analysing NGS datasets that are now being routinely generated. TrawlerWeb is freely available and accessible at: http://trawler.erc.monash.edu.au ."
": RNA interference is a strong mechanism of gene silencing which underlies many fields of eukaryotic biology (1). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs and a gene regulation expression system showing a tissue-specific expression pattern, and inhibits protein synthesis (2). For the first time, miRNA has been seen in Caenorhabditis elegans (3). They play an important role in signaling pathways of various diseases especially periodontal disease and cancers (4). One of the most important diseases in association with gingival infectious is periodontal diseases, which if untreated leads to tooth loss, hence in present paper focus on the effects of MicroRNAs and their targets in disease which was mentioned above."
"Endometriosis has been considered as an estrogen (E2)-dependent and progesterone (P4)-resistant disease. On the other hand, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has been suggested as a significant modulator of ovarian pathology, acting via both LPA levels and LPA receptor (LPAR) upregulation. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate LPA concentration as well as LPARs, autotaxin (ATX), and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) expression in ovarian endometriotic cysts and normal endometrium with correlation of the expression of E2 and P4 receptors in endometriotic cysts. The analyses were carried out using the tissues derived from 37 patients with ovarian endometriosis and 20 endometrial samples collected from women without endometriosis were used as a control. We found that ovarian endometriotic cysts are a site of LPA synthesis due to the presence of enzymes involved in LPA synthesis in the tissue. Additionally, when we compared endometriotic cysts versus normal endometrium, we were able to show overexpression of 3 from 6 examined LPARs and both enzymes responsible for LPA synthesis in endometriotic cysts. Finally, we found the correlations between LPARs, ATX, and PLA2 and the expression of E2 and P4 receptors in endometriotic cysts. Owing to the high LPAR2 and LPAR4 transcript and protein expression in endometriotic ovarian cysts and positive correlations of both these receptors with the PR-B and ER?, respectively, those receptors seem to be the most promising predictors of the endometriotic cysts as well as the main receptors responsible for LPA action in the ovarian endometriosis."
"About 50-75% of patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) develop gastro-intestinal symptoms with surgical complications such as intussusception occurring in 0.7-13.6%. In 10-40% of patients, however, gastro-intestinal manifestations may precede the onset of purpura. In patients with gastro-intestinal tract involvement without purpura, confirming the diagnosis of HSP and determining the appropriate treatment remains difficult. A seven-year-old boy presented with recurrent intussusception owing to HSP without purpura. It was confirmed pathologically and treated via colonoscopy. Early colonoscopic intervention can contribute to the early diagnosis of HSP and its subsequent management by avoiding unnecessary surgical invasion."
"In both child and adult psychiatry, empirical evidence has now accrued to suggest that a single dimension is able to measure a person's liability to mental disorder, comorbidity among disorders, persistence of disorders over time, and severity of symptoms. This single dimension of general psychopathology has been termed ""p,"" because it conceptually parallels a dimension already familiar to behavioral scientists and clinicians: the ""g"" factor of general intelligence. As the g dimension reflects low to high mental ability, the p dimension represents low to high psychopathology severity, with thought disorder at the extreme. The dimension of p unites all disorders. It influences present/absent status on hundreds of psychiatric symptoms, which modern nosological systems typically aggregate into dozens of distinct diagnoses, which in turn aggregate into three overarching domains, namely, the externalizing, internalizing, and psychotic experience domains, which finally aggregate into one dimension of psychopathology from low to high: p. Studies show that the higher a person scores on p, the worse that person fares on measures of family history of psychiatric illness, brain function, childhood developmental history, and adult life impairment. A dimension of p may help account for ubiquitous nonspecificity in psychiatry: multiple disorders share the same risk factors and biomarkers and often respond to the same therapies. Here, the authors summarize the history of the unidimensional idea, review modern research into p, demystify statistical models, articulate some implications of p for prevention and clinical practice, and outline a transdiagnostic research agenda."
"Curcumin is a polyphenol derived from the herb Curcuma longa, which has been extensively studied in terms of its antitumour, antioxidant, and chemopreventive activity as well as various other effects. In the present work we compared curcumin with its synthetic analogue dimethoxycurcumin (dimc) in terms of its antioxidant enzyme-modulating effects in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We found that these compounds modulate antioxidant enzymes differentially. Both curcumin and dimethoxycurcumin effected a decrease in lipid peroxidation status in PBMC, however, curcumin had better activity in this regard. An increase in the activity of catalase was seen in the case of curcumin-treated PBMC, whereas dimc increased catalase activity significantly to almost twofold level. Real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed significant up-regulation of catalase at mRNA level post treatment with curcumin as well as dimc, however, dimc had better activity in this regard. Glutathione reductase (GR) activity and reduced glutathione levels increased in the case of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) treated with curcumin, however, the trend was reversed with dimethoxycurcumin where, both glutathione reductase activity and reduced glutathione levels were significantly reduced. RT-PCR analysis of glutathione reductase mRNA levels showed decrease in mRNA levels post treatment with dimethoxycurcumin (dimc) further corroborating GR enzyme assay results, however, we could not obtain significant result post curcumin treatment. NFkB reporter assay and western blot analysis of nuclear as well as cytosolic fractions of NFkB revealed that curcumin inhibits NFkB activation whereas inhibition was much less with dimc. It has been reported that curcumin and dimc exerts differential cytotoxicity in normal and tumour cells and the reason for this had been attributed to the differential uptake of these compounds by normal cells and tumour cells. Based on our results we propose that differential modulation of antioxidant enzymes via NFkB pathway could be the reason behind differential cytotoxicity of dimc as well as curcumin in normal cells and tumour cells in addition to differential uptake of these compounds as reported previously."
"To improve the welfare of nonhuman animals under professional care, zoological institutions are continuously utilizing new methods to identify factors that lead to optimal welfare. Comparative methods have historically been used in the field of evolutionary biology but are increasingly being applied in the field of animal welfare. In the current study, data were obtained from direct behavioral observation and institutional records representing 80 individual animals from 34 different species of the order Carnivora. Data were examined to determine if a variety of natural history and animal management factors impacted the welfare of animals in zoological institutions. Output variables indicating welfare status included behavioral diversity, pacing, offspring production, and infant mortality. Results suggested that generalist species have higher behavioral diversity and offspring production in zoos compared with their specialist counterparts. In addition, increased minimum distance from the public decreased pacing and increased offspring production, while increased maximum distance from the public and large enclosure size decreased infant mortality. These results have implications for future exhibit design or renovation, as well as management practices and priorities for future research."
"We use a 0-D photochemical box model and a 3-D global chemistry-climate model, combined with observations from the NOAA Southeast Nexus (SENEX) aircraft campaign, to understand the sources and sinks of glyoxal over the Southeast United States. Box model simulations suggest a large difference in glyoxal production among three isoprene oxidation mechanisms (AM3ST, AM3B, and MCM v3.3.1). These mechanisms are then implemented into a 3-D global chemistry-climate model. Comparison with field observations shows that the average vertical profile of glyoxal is best reproduced by AM3ST with an effective reactive uptake coefficient ?glyxof 2 × 10-3, and AM3B without heterogeneous loss of glyoxal. The two mechanisms lead to 0-0.8 ?g m-3secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from glyoxal in the boundary layer of the Southeast U.S. in summer. We consider this to be the lower limit for the contribution of glyoxal to SOA, as other sources of glyoxal other than isoprene are not included in our model. In addition, we find that AM3B shows better agreement on both formaldehyde and the correlation between glyoxal and formaldehyde (RGF= [GLYX]/[HCHO]), resulting from the suppression of ?-isoprene peroxy radicals (?-ISOPO2). We also find that MCM v3.3.1 may underestimate glyoxal production from isoprene oxidation, in part due to an underestimated yield from the reaction of IEPOX peroxy radicals (IEPOXOO) with HO2. Our work highlights that the gas-phase production of glyoxal represents a large uncertainty in quantifying its contribution to SOA."
"Based on their unique advantages, increasing interest has been shown in the use of aptamers as target ligands for specific cancer cell recognition and targeted cancer therapy. Recently, the development of aptamer-conjugated nanomaterials has offered new therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment with better efficacy and lower toxicity. We highlight some of the promising classes of aptamer-conjugated nanomaterials for the specific recognition of cancer cells and targeted cancer therapy. Recent developments in the use of novel strategies that enable sensitive and selective cancer cell recognition are introduced. In addition to targeted drug delivery for chemotherapy, we also review how aptamer-conjugated nanomaterials are being incorporated into emerging technologies with significant improvement in efficiency and selectivity in cancer treatment."
"The chemical link between isoprene and formaldehyde (HCHO) is a strong, non-linear function of NOx(= NO + NO2). This relationship is a linchpin for top-down isoprene emission inventory verification from orbital HCHO column observations. It is also a benchmark for overall photochemical mechanism performance with regard to VOC oxidation. Using a comprehensive suite of airbornein situobservations over the Southeast U.S., we quantify HCHO production across the urban-rural spectrum. Analysis of isoprene and its major first-generation oxidation products allows us to define both a ""prompt"" yield of HCHO (molecules of HCHO produced per molecule of freshly-emitted isoprene) and the background HCHO mixing ratio (from oxidation of longer-lived hydrocarbons). Over the range of observed NOxvalues (roughly 0.1 - 2 ppbv), the prompt yield increases by a factor of 3 (from 0.3 to 0.9 ppbv ppbv-1), while background HCHO increases by a factor of 2 (from 1.6 to 3.3 ppbv). We apply the same method to evaluate the performance of both a global chemical transport model (AM3) and a measurement-constrained 0-D steady state box model. Both models reproduce the NOxdependence of the prompt HCHO yield, illustrating that models with updated isoprene oxidation mechanisms can adequately capture the link between HCHO and recent isoprene emissions. On the other hand, both models under-estimate background HCHO mixing ratios, suggesting missing HCHO precursors, inadequate representation of later-generation isoprene degradation and/or under-estimated hydroxyl radical concentrations. Detailed process rates from the box model simulation demonstrate a 3-fold increase in HCHO production across the range of observed NOxvalues, driven by a 100% increase in OH and a 40% increase in branching of organic peroxy radical reactions to produce HCHO."
"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most devastating diseases affecting livestock. Since vaccines fail to provide protection until seven days post-vaccination, the application of anti-viral molecules is imperative for suppressing the spread of FMDV prior to development of an adaptive immune response. Interferons (IFNs) are effective for the host to fight FMDV infections; however, a novel type I IFNs, interferon delta (IFN-?), has not been investigated for their antiviral effects against this virus. Thus, this study investigated FMDV infection, upon pre- and post-treatment with PoIFN-?8. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to quantify the expression levels of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including ISG15, OAS1, PKR, and Mx1. Results showed the PoIFN-?8 lacking its signal sequence was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant PoIFN-?8 exerted a significantly protective effect against two different serotypes of FMDV in IBRS-2 cells. In addition, PoIFN-?8 induced the expression of IFN-stimulated genes. These findings highlight the significance of PoIFN-? might serve as an antiviral agent for the prevention of FMDV in pigs and will stimulate the study of exploiting the potential biological functions of IFN-? in the future."
"Although ginsenoside Rg3 was isolated as a major component of Korea red ginseng and confirmed to exert potential hepatoprotective effect on acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury via induction of glutathione S-transferase (GST) in vitro, thein vivo hepatoprotective effect of Rg3 and the underlying molecular mechanism of action remain unclear. The current study was aimed to explore whether 20(R)-Ginsenoside Rg3 (20(R)-Rg3) could alleviate acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice and to determine the involvement of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrated that a single injection of APAP (250?mg/kg) increased the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), and interleukin-1? (IL-1?); such increases were attenuated by pretreatment of mice with 20(R)-Rg3 for seven days. The depletion of glutathione (GSH), generation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the over expression of cytochrome P450 E1 (CYP2E1) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) caused by APAP exposure were also inhibited by 20(R)-Rg3 pretreatment. Moreover, 20(R)-Rg3 pretreatment significantly alleviated APAP-induced apoptosis, necrosis, and inflammatory infiltration in liver tissues. Importantly, 20(R)-Rg3 effectively attenuated APAP-induced liver injury in part via activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In summary, 20(R)-Rg3 exerted liver protection against APAP-caused hepatotoxicity evidenced by inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory response, alleviation of hepatocellular necrosis and apoptosis via activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, showing potential as a novel therapeutic agent to prevent liver damage."
"Ground-level ozone (O3) concentrations have been elevating in the last century. While there has been a notable progress in understanding O3effects on vegetation, O3effects on ecological stoichiometry remain unclear, especially early in the oxidative stress. Ethyelenediurea (EDU) is a chemical compound widely applied in research projects as protectant of plants against O3injury, however its mode of action remains unclear. To investigate O3and EDU effects early in the stress, we sprayed willow (Salix sachalinensis) plants with 0, 200 or 400?mg EDU L-1, and exposed them to either low ambient O3(AOZ) or elevated O3(EOZ) levels during the daytime, for about one month, in a free air O3controlled exposure (FACE); EDU treatment was repeated every nine days. We collected samples for analyses from basal, top, and shed leaves, before leaves develop visible O3symptoms. We found that O3altered the ecological stoichiometry, including impacts in nutrient resorption efficiency, early in the stress. The relation between P content and Fe content seemed to have a critical role in maintaining homeostasis in an effort to prevent O3-induced damage. Photosynthetic pigments and P content appeared to play an important role in EDU mode of action. This study provides novel insights on the stress biology which are of ecological and toxicological importance."
"Microalgae biotechnology is a promising tool for many applications, including the elimination of nutrients and other contaminants from wastewater. In this work, we measured the removal efficiency of two wastewater treatment processes: an activated-sludge based conventional process and another based on microalgae biotechnology using high-rate algae ponds (HRAPs). The latter was tested using two different configurations. In the first one, HRAPs were placed after an UASB reactor and used as a tertiary treatment to remove nutrients. In the second, the UASB reactor was disconnected so the HRAPs were directly fed with pretreated wastewater. Additional treatment was performed using dissolved air flotation (DAF). The performances of both configurations (UASB-HRAP and HRAP-DAF) were compared to that of the conventional line including primary and secondary biological treatments and operating in parallel within the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Sixty-four out of 81 target PhACs were detected in the influent of the WWTP, at an average concentration of 223??g?L-1, whereas 55 and 54 were measured in the conventional (14??g?L-1) and non-conventional (17??g?L-1) effluents. Average removal efficiencies were similar (94 vs. 92%) for both treatment lines when comparing total PhACs concentrations. The compositional patterns of the resulting effluents, however, were not, suggesting the occurrence of differential removal mechanisms depending on the chemicals and wastewater treatments considered. Highly consumed compounds such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen were predominant in the non-conventional effluent (>1??g?L-1), denoting lower removal than in the conventional line. On the other hand, elimination of diclofenac and some specific antibiotics and diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) was between 15 and 50% higher using HRAPs. Overall, the efficiency of the microalgae technology removing PhACs was found to be comparable to that used in conventional WWTPs. This, combined with a higher efficiency removing nutrients, shows the potential of HRAP technology for wastewater treatment as an alternative (or addition as tertiary treatment) to more conventional approaches based on activated sludge."
"RNA helicases play crucial roles in RNA splicing, transport, editing and degradation, protein translation initiation and siRNA-mediated gene silencing. However, knowledge about their functionality in rapeseed (Brassica napus) is rare. In the study, we identified and annotated 271 RNA helicase genes from B. napus using bioinformatics and high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Three subfamilies DEAD-box, DEAH-box, or DExD/H-box have been identified. One hundred and ninety-five RNA helicases were confirmed by RNA-seq and 49 were identified to differentially respond to cadmium (Cd) stress (> 1.5 fold change, p?<?0.05). As an example, we functionally specified BnaA04g26450D encoding a BnRH24 under Cd exposure. BnRH24 is a constitutive gene expressing throughout the life span. Using our previously generated degradome datasets, we found that BnRH24 can be cleaved by miR158, suggesting that BnRH24 is a target of miR158 in B. napus. The mature miR158 was induced, while BnRH24 was repressed in B. napus under Cd stress. The contrasting expression pattern of B. napus miR158 and BnRH24 under the normal and Cd would support the post-transcriptional regulation of BnRH24 by miR158. Ectopic expression of BnRH24 in Arabidopsis revealed that the transgenic lines showed more sensitivity to Cd toxicity by reducing root elongation, fresh mass production, chlorophyll accumulation and increasing oxidative products such as O2-., H2O2and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), indicating that the controlling the level of BnRH24 by miR158 may be required for Cd tolerance in plants."
"Many animal species evolved some form of body armor, such as scales of fish and bony plates or osteoderms of reptiles. Although a protective function is often taken for granted, recent studies show that body armor might comprise multiple functionalities and is shaped by trade-offs among these functionalities. Hence, despite the fact that natural body armor might serve as bio-inspiration for the development of artificial protective materials, focussing on model systems in which body armor serves a solely protective function might be pivotal. In this study, we investigate the osteoderms of Glyptotherium arizonae, an extinct armadillo-like mammal in which body armor evolved as protection against predators and/or tail club blows of conspecifics. By using a combination of micro-computed tomography, reverse-engineering, stress simulations and mechanical testing of 3D printed models, we show that the combination of dense compact layers and porous lattice core might provide an optimized combination of strength and high energy absorption."
"Microcystin-leucine arginine (MC-LR) causes decline of serum testosterone levels resulting in impaired spermatogenesis; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of MC-LR exposure on the number of Leydig cells (LCs) in testis. Following chronic low dose exposure to MC-LR, the number of LCs was markedly decreased while macrophages were significantly increased. Then, we established a co-culture system to study the interaction between macrophages and LCs in the presence of MC-LR. No significant apoptosis of LCs cultured alone was observed after MC-LR (<?5 000?nM) treatment; however, apoptosis was robustly increased when LCs were co-cultured with macrophages in the presence of MC-LR. Further studies identified that MC-LR could stimulate macrophage to produce TNF-?, and secreted TNF-? induced LC apoptosis by binding to the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) on the LCs and thus activating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-p38MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, we also examined increased expression of Axl receptor and growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) in macrophages after MC-LR treatment. GAS6 mediates phagocytosis of apoptotic LCs by binding to the Axl receptor on macrophages and phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) on apoptotic LCs. Together, these results suggested that reduced serum testosterone levels may be associated with decrease of LCs as a result of LC apoptosis and phagocytosis by immune cells in MC-LR-treated mice."
"Two cDNAs of RXR were isolated, for the first time, from the ivory shell, Babylonia japonica, and the transcriptional activities were tested in vitro to compare with other gastropod (Thais clavigera and Nucella lapillus) RXR isoforms. The transcriptional activities of all of these RXR isoforms were significantly induced by mammalian RXR agonist, 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA). The transcriptional activity of T. clavigera RXR-1 was also examined by using 9cRA and 16 organotin compounds, and significant ligand-dependent transactivations were observed by 9cRA and 5 organotins (tributyltin (TBT), tetrabutyltin (TeBT), tripropyltin (TPrT), tricyclohexyltin (TcHT) and triphenyltin (TPhT)). These 5 organotins also induced significant transcriptional activities in N. lapillus and B. japonica RXR isoforms. These 4 organotins, except for TeBT, have been reported to promote the development of imposex after a month of a single injection each, using female T. clavigera. To investigate the function of gastropod RXR isoforms, the effects of mammalian specific pan-agonist, PA024, and pan-antagonist, HX531, were examined, and significant induction of transcriptional activity by PA024 was demonstrated in these gastropod RXR isoforms. The additions of HX531 significantly suppressed the transcriptional activities of these gastropod RXR isoforms by 9cRA and 5 organotins. Using the mammalian two retinoic acid response elements, the transcriptional activities by 2 agonists, 9cRA and PA024, were different among the RXR isoforms of each gastropod species. With retinoid X response element (RXRE), transcriptional activities of TcRXR-1, BjRXR-1, and NlRXRa were significantly higher than those of TcRXR-2, BjRXR-2, and NlRXRb. Transcriptional activities of TcRXR-2, BjRXR-2, and NlRXRb, however, were significantly higher than those of TcRXR-1, BjRXR-1, and NlRXRa with thyroid hormone response element, TREpal. Thus, induction of imposex in prosobranch gastropods is strongly suggested to be triggered by 9cRA and certain organotins, such as TBT and TPhT through the activation of RXRs. These gastropod RXRs might control the different gene transcription by forming homo- or heterodimer complex with their own isoforms. These findings will contribute to our understanding of the fundamentals of the endocrine system in molluscs, particularly on RXR signaling pathway."
"Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture methods are of high importance to studies of biological processes. This is particularly the case with spheroid cultures, which create 3D cell aggregates without the use of exogenous materials. Compared to conventional monolayer cultures, cellular spheroid cultures have been demonstrated to improve multilineage potential and extracellular matrix production. To address this issue in depth, we present a more comprehensive analysis of 3D human dental pulp cell (hDPC) spheroids.hDPC spheroids were fabricated by the pellet culture method and were cultured without adding any reagent to induce differentiation. The gene-expression profiles of the 3D and two-dimensional (2D) cultured hDPCs were compared by complementary DNA microarray analysis. Odontoblastic and osteoblastic differentiation marker gene expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were applied to examine the morphology of hDPC spheroids and extracellular matrix components.Compared with 2D monolayer culture, microarray analysis identified 405 genes and 279 genes with twofold or greater differential expression after 3?days and 28?days of 3D culture, respectively. In 3D hDPC spheroids, gene ontology analysis revealed upregulation of extracellular matrix-related genes and downregulation of cell growth-related genes. RT-qPCR analysis showed higher expression levels of osteocalcin, dentin sialophosphoprotein, and alkaline phosphatase. TEM revealed the morphological characteristics of the fibrillar collagen-rich matrix and cell-cell interactions.The present findings provide clues to understanding the mechanisms of pellet-cultured hDPCs and contribute to future research in the comparative studies of different 3D culture methods."
"Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (SRM) is increasingly being applied as a complementary method to resolve the organization of large biomolecular assemblies. One of its main advantages is that it provides information on protein organization and identity simultaneously, within the native cellular milieu. It also extends the accessible range of structures up to the micrometer scale, offering complementary information relative to classical structural biology methods. Furthermore, SRM is capable of resolving the organization of some biomolecular assemblies not accessible to other methods. We highlight these advantages within the context of deciphering the structure of the centrosome and chromatin, and discuss how computational data post-processing has been adapted for SRM data. We also outline current limitations and potential approaches to overcome them."
"Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) have one of the poorest survival rates of all cancers. The main reason for this is related to the unique tumor stroma and poor vascularization of PDAC. As a consequence, chemotherapeutic drugs, such as nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine, cannot efficiently penetrate into the tumor tissue. Non-invasive radiofrequency (RF) mild hyperthermia treatment was proposed as a synergistic therapy to enhance drug uptake into the tumor by increasing tumor vascular inflow and perfusion, thus, increasing the effect of chemotherapy. RF-induced hyperthermia is a safer and non-invasive technique of tumor heating compared to conventional contact heating procedures. In this study, we investigated the short- and long-term effects (~20 days and 65 days, respectively) of combination chemotherapy and RF hyperthermia in an orthotopic PDAC model in mice. The benefit of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine treatment was confirmed in mice; however, the effect of treatment was statistically insignificant in comparison to saline treated mice during long-term observation. The benefit of RF was minimal in the short-term and completely insignificant during long-term observation."
"Accumulation of selected secondary metabolites in two Hypericum species (H. perforatum and H. annulatum) was compared in their vegetative parts (stems and leaves) and in terms of the extraction solvent (80% aq. methanol or 60% aq. ethanol). The presence of chlorogenic acid and quercitrin was not detected in stem of both species. Almost all metabolites were more accumulated in the leaves than in the stems (rutin, hyperoside, quercetin and hypericin) but epicatechin showed the opposite in both species and hyperforin in H. annulatum. Extraction solvents showed rather species-specific differences with EtOH being more suitable for the extraction of hypericin, quercetin, quercitrin, and hyperoside (on average, for both the leaves and stems, extraction increased by approximately 130, 30, 25, and 15%, respectively) while MeOH for the extraction of epicatechin, rutin, and hyperforin (increased extraction by approximately 50, 40, and 35%, respectively). On the other hand, content of total soluble phenols did not differ in relation to solvent in any organ or species. Various ages of H. annulatum plants did not show dramatic impact on the amount of metabolites. Subsequently, the usefulness of capillary electrophoresis (CE) as an alternative to HPLC for the quantification of metabolites in H. perforatum was tested and results showed non-significant differences between CE and HPLC with the methods we developed (the difference did not exceed 10%)."
"We analysed changes in the abundance, biomass and cell size of the microbial food web community (bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates) at contrasting nutrient concentrations and temperatures during a simulated heat wave. We used 24 mesocosms mimicking shallow lakes in which two nutrient levels (unenriched and enriched by adding nitrogen and phosphorus) and three different temperature scenarios (ambient, IPCC A2 scenario and A2+%50) are simulated (4 replicates of each). Experiments using the mesocosms have been running un-interrupted since 2003. A 1-month heat wave was imitated by an extra 5?°C increase in the previously heated mesocosms (from 1st July to 1st August 2014). Changes in water temperature induced within a few days a strong effect on the microbial food web functioning, demonstrating a quick response of microbial communities to the changes in environment, due to their short generation times. Warming and nutrients showed synergistic effects. Microbial assemblages of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates responded positively to the heating, the increase being largest in the enriched mesocosms. The results indicate that warming and nutrients in combination can set off complex interactions in the microbial food web functioning."
"Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying snake venom variability provides important clues for understanding how the biological functions of this powerful toxic arsenal evolve. We analyzed in detail individual transcripts and venom protein isoforms produced by five specimens of a venomous snake (Bothrops atrox) from two nearby but genetically distinct populations from the Brazilian Amazon rainforest which show functional similarities in venom properties. Individual variation was observed among the venoms of these specimens, but the overall abundance of each general toxin family was conserved both in transcript and in venom protein levels. However, when expression of independent paralogues was analyzed, remarkable differences were observed within and among each toxin group, both between individuals and between populations. Transcripts for functionally essential venom proteins (""core function"" proteins) were highly expressed in all specimens and showed similar transcription/translation rates. In contrast, other paralogues (""adaptive"" proteins) showed lower expression levels and the toxins they coded for varied among different individuals. These results provide support for the inferences that (a) expression and translational differences play a greater role in defining adaptive variation in venom phenotypes than does sequence variation in protein coding genes and (b) convergent adaptive venom phenotypes can be generated through different molecular mechanisms.Analysis of individual transcripts and venom protein isoforms produced by specimens of a venomous snake (Bothrops atrox), from the Brazilian Amazon rainforest, revealed that transcriptional and translational mechanisms contribute to venom phenotypic variation. Our finding of evidence for high expression of toxin proteins with conserved function supports the hypothesis that the venom phenotype consists of two kinds of proteins: conserved ""core function"" proteins that provide essential functional activities with broader relevance and less conserved ""adaptive"" proteins that vary in expression and may permit customization of protein function. These observations allowed us to suggest that genetic mechanisms controlling venom variability are not restricted to selection of gene copies or mutations in structural genes but also to selection of the mechanisms controlling gene expression, contributing to the plasticity of this important phenotype for venomous snakes."
"CD4 T cells play a multiplicity of roles in protective immunity to influenza. Included in these functions are help for high affinity antibody production, enhancement of CD8 T cell expansion, function and memory, acceleration of the early innate response to infection and direct cytotoxicity. The influenza-specific CD4 T cell repertoire in humans established through exposures to infection and vaccination has been found to be highly variable in abundance, specificity and functionality. Deficits in particular subsets of CD4 T cells recruited into the response result in diminished antibody responses and protection from infection. Therefore, improved strategies for vaccination should include better methods to identify deficiencies in the circulating CD4 T cell repertoire, and vaccine constructs that increase the representation of CD4 T cells of the correct specificity and functionality."
"The recently emerged CRISPR/Cas9 technology is the most flexible means to produce targeted mutations at the genomic loci in a variety of organisms. In Crustaceans, molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) is an important negative-regulatory factor and plays a key role in suppressing the molting process. However, whether precise disruption of MIH in crustacean can be achieved and successfully used to improve the development and growth has not been proved. In this research, the complementary DNA (cDNA) and genomic DNA, including flanking regions of the MIH gene (EcMIH) of ridgetail white prawn Exopalaemon carinicauda, were cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that EcMIH was composed of three exons and two introns. Analysis by RT-PCR showed that EcMIH mainly expressed in eyestalks. During different development periods, EcMIH was highest in juvenile stage and extremely low in others but adult prawns eyestalks. In addition, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate EcMIH knock-out (KO) prawns and then analyzed the changes in their phenotypes. We efficiently generated 12 EcMIH-KO prawns out of 250 injected one-cell stage embryos and the mutant rate reached 4.8% after embryo injection with one sgRNA targeting the second exon of EcMIH. The EcMIH-KO prawns exhibited increased the body length and shortened the metamorphosis time of larvae from mysis larva to postlarva. Meanwhile, EcMIH-KO did not cause the health problems such as early stage death or deformity. In conclusion, we successfully obtained EcMIH gene and generated EcMIH-KO prawns using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. This study will certainly lead to a wide application prospect of MIH gene in prawns breeding."
"Protein-nanoparticle (NP) interactions dictate properties of nanoconjugates relevant for bionanotechnology. Non-covalent adsorption generates a protein corona (PC) formed by an inner and an outer layer, the hard and soft corona (HC, SC). Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exist in solution as conformational ensembles, whose features in the presence of NPs are not well known.Three IDPs (?-casein, Sic1 and ?-synuclein) and lysozyme are compared, describing conformational properties inside HC on silica NPs by circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.IDPs inside HC are largely unstructured, but display small, protein-specific conformational changes. A minor increase in helical content is observed for ?-casein and ?-synuclein, reminiscent of membrane effects on ?-synuclein. Frozen in their largely disordered conformation, bound proteins do not undergo folding induced by dehydration, as they do in their free forms. While HC thickness approaches the hydrodynamic diameter of the protein in solution for lysozyme, it is much below the respective values for IDPs. NPs boost ?-synuclein aggregation kinetics in a dose-dependent manner.IDPs maintain structural disorder inside HC, experiencing minor, protein-specific, induced folding and stabilization against further conformational transitions, such as formation of intermolecular beta-sheets upon dehydration. The HC is formed by a single layer of protein molecules. SC likely plays a key role stabilizing amyloidogenic ?-synuclein conformers.Protein-NP interactions can mimic those with macromolecular partners, allowing dissection of contributing factors by rational design of NP surfaces. Application of NPs in vivo should be carefully tested for amyloidogenic potential."
"Pmr1 is the Golgi/ER calcium pump, while Rch1 is a newly identified negative regulator of calcium influx in the plasma membrane of yeast cells. We show here that CaRch1 plays a dominant role over CaPmr1 in response of Candida albicans to SDS and tunicamycin stresses, while CaPmr1 has a major role in cell wall stress. Deletion of CaRCH1 increases the calcium/calcineurin signaling level in cells lacking CaPMR1. Calcineurin function is required for the role of CaRch1 in SDS stresses, while it is required for the function of CaPmr1 under all conditions examined. Disruption of CaRCH1 alone does not reduce the cell wall chitin, mannan or ?-glucan content, but lack of CaRCH1 slightly decreases the chitin content of cells lacking CaPMR1. Furthermore, CaRch1 and CaPmr1 have an additive effect on filamentation of C. albicans cells in vitro. Cells lacking both CaRCH1 and CaPMR1 and cells lacking CaPMR1 alone show a similar degree of virulence attenuation, being much more attenuated than cells lacking CaRCH1 alone. Therefore, CaRch1 genetically interacts with CaPmr1 in the regulation of in vitro filamentation in C. albicans."
"The structure of RNA has been a natural subject for mathematical modeling, inviting many innovative computational frameworks. This single-stranded polynucleotide chain can fold upon itself in numerous ways to form hydrogen-bonded segments, imperfect with single-stranded loops. Illustrating these paired and non-paired interaction networks, known as RNA's secondary (2D) structure, using mathematical graph objects has been illuminating for RNA structure analysis. Building upon such seminal work from the 1970s and 1980s, graph models are now used to study not only RNA structure but also describe RNA's recurring modular units, sample the conformational space accessible to RNAs, predict RNA's three-dimensional folds, and apply the combined aspects to novel RNA design. In this chapter, we outline the development of the RNA-As-Graphs (or RAG) approach and highlight current applications to RNA structure prediction and design."
"Ras oncoproteins play pivotal roles in both the development and maintenance of many tumor types. Unfortunately, these proteins are difficult to directly target using traditional pharmacological strategies, in part due to their lack of obvious binding pockets or allosteric sites. This obstacle has driven a considerable amount of research into pursuing alternative ways to effectively inhibit Ras, examples of which include inducing mislocalization to prevent Ras maturation and inactivating downstream proteins in Ras-driven signaling pathways. Ras proteins are archetypes of a superfamily of small GTPases that play specific roles in the regulation of many cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, nuclear transport, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and cell cycle progression. Several other superfamily members have also been linked to the control of normal and cancer cell growth and survival. For example, Rap1 has high sequence similarity to Ras, has overlapping binding partners, and has been demonstrated to both oppose and mimic Ras-driven cancer phenotypes. Rap1 plays an important role in cell adhesion and integrin function in a variety of cell types. Mechanistically, Ras and Rap1 cooperate to initiate and sustain ERK signaling, which is activated in many malignancies and is the target of successful therapeutics. Here we review the role activated Rap1 in ERK signaling and other downstream pathways to promote invasion and cell migration and metastasis in various cancer types."
"Symbiotic microorganisms associated with thirteen species of the subfamily Deltocephalinae were examined using microscopic and molecular techniques. Athysanus argentarius, Euscelis incisus, Doratura stylata, Arthaldeus pascuellus, Errastunus ocellaris, Jassargus flori, Jassargus pseudocellaris, Psammotettix alienus, Psammotettix confinis, Turrutus socialis and Verdanus abdominalis harbor two types of ancient bacteriome-associated microorganisms: bacteria Sulcia (phylum Bacteroidetes) and bacteria Nasuia (phylum Proteobacteria, class Betaproteobacteria). In Balclutha calamagrostis and Balclutha punctata, the bacterium Nasuia has not been detected. In the bacteriomes of both species of Balclutha examined, only bacteria Sulcia occur, whereas Sodalis-like symbionts (phylum Proteobacteria, class Gammaproteobacteria) are localized in the fat body cells, in the close vicinity of the bacteriomes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the co-existence in the Deltocephalinae leafhoppers of the ancient symbiont Sulcia and the more recently acquired Sodalis-like bacterium. The obtained results provide further evidence indicating that Deltocephalinae leafhoppers are characterized by a large diversity of symbiotic systems, which results from symbiont acquisition and replacement. The obtained results are additionally discussed in the phylogenetic context."
"Five new guaiane-type sesquiterpene lactones, caroguaianolide A-E (1-5), along with nine known sesquiterpene lactones (6-14) were isolated from the whole plant of Carpesium abrotanoides L. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic date, HRESIMS analysis, and comparison of experimental and calculated ECD data. All isolated compounds (1-14) were tested in vitro for their cytotoxic activities against the MDA-MB-231, HGC-27 cancer cell lines, of which compounds 1-3, 6, 7, 11 and 12 showed significant cytotoxic activities with IC50values ranging from 2.67 to 12.34??M."
"In K. pneumoniae, the loss of the two major outer membrane porins (OMPs) OmpK35 and OmpK36 confers resistance to carbapenem in strains producing extended spectrum ?-lactamases or plasmid-mediated AmpC-type ?-lactamases. At Charles Nicolle hospital of Tunis, all carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were collected over a 6-year period. The aim of this work was to investigate the mechanisms responsible for carbapenem resistance in non-carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (NCPK) strains. Among the 334 CRE collected strains between 2010 and 2015, 44 (13.8%) were NCPK. MICs ranges of ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem were 1->32 mg/L, 0.125-8 mg/L and 0.125-32mg/L, respectively. All strains showed multidrug resistant phenotype and were negative for carbapenemase activity. None of the carbapenemase genes searched was found. ESBL production was confirmed in all isolates, but one [CTX-M-15 (n=39), SHV-5 (n=4)]. Three isolates produce DHA-1 (associated to CTX-M-15 in 2 strains). Molecular fingerprints grouped the 44 isolates into 7 clusters. In 7 representative strains of these clusters, the SDS-PAGE results showed that four isolates lacked the OmpK35 porin, one isolate lacked the OmpK36, and two isolates lacked both OmpK35 and OmpK36. Sequencing of the corresponding porin genes showed amino acid insertions and deletions leading to the early termination of translation, point mutations in the promoter region, or insertion sequences disrupting the gene coding sequence. Loss or deficiency of OMPs, coupled with ESBL and/or AmpC production, plays an important role in conferring carbapenem resistance in K. pneumoniae. Dissemination of these multidrug resistant bacteria in our hospital may create serious therapeutic problems in the future."
"The mechanism by which bta-miR-378 regulates bovine skeletal muscle-derived satellite cell (bMDSC) myogenesis remains unknown. In this study, stem-loop RT-PCR was used to assess bta-miR-378 expression during the proliferation and differentiation of bMDSCs. The results showed that bta-miR-378 expression did not obviously change during bMDSC proliferation but increased significantly when bMDSCs began to differentiate. Then, a bta-miR-378 mimic (bta-miR-378-M) and bta-miR-378 inhibitor (bta-miR-378-I) were transfected into bMDSCs to explore the effect of bta-miR-378 on bMDSC differentiation. Cell differentiation was detected using myosin heavy chain 3 immunofluorescence, myotube formation, and desmin and myogenin western blotting analyses. As expected, bta-miR-378-M enhanced bMDSC differentiation, whereas bta-miR-378-I had the opposite effect. Moreover, luciferase reporter and western blotting assays showed that bta-miR-378 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated regions of DNA polymerase alpha subunit B (POLA2) to regulate its protein expression. In summary, these data indicate that bta-miR-378 targets POLA2 to promote the differentiation of bMDSCs, which provides further insight into the biological functions of bta-miR-378 in bovines."
"Amaranthus caudatus is traditionally used to treat infections. Based on its traditional usage, we investigated the effect of A. caudatus on the bladder epithelial cells in the protection of E. coli infection.The direct antimicrobial effects of A. caudatus on uropathogenic bacteria were investigated using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay. Bladder epithelial cell lines T24 and 5637 and uropathogenic E. coli strain #12 were used to investigate the effect of A. caudatus. Bacterial adhesion and invasion into bladder cells treated with A. caudatus was analysed. Expression of uroplakin-1a (UPK1A), ?1 integrin (ITGB1), caveolin-1 (CAV1) and the antimicrobial peptides human ? defensin-2 (DEFB4A) and LL-37 (CAMP) was evaluated using RT-PCR.No direct antibacterial effect on E. coli or any of the tested uropathogenic strains was observed by A. caudatus. However, we demonstrate reduced mRNA expression of uroplakin-1a and caveolin-1, but not ?1 integrin after treatment of uroepithelial cells, mirrored by the decreased adhesion and invasion of E. coli. A. caudatus treatment did not induce increased gene expression of the antimicrobial peptides, LL-37 and human ?-defensin-2.Our results showed that A. caudatus has a protective role on bladder epithelial cells against uropathogenic E. coli infection by decreasing the bacterial adhesion and invasion, thereby preventing infection."
"One of the three domains of kinetoplastid NADH:fumarate oxidoreductase (FRD) is homologous to bacterial flavin transferase that catalyzes transfer of FMN residue from FAD to threonine in flavoproteins. Leptomonas pyrrhocoris FRD produced in yeast cells, which lack flavin transferase gene in their proteome, reduces fumarate in the presence of NADH and contains an FMN residue covalently linked to a Ser9 residue. The conserved flavinylation motif of FRD, D3(g/s)x(s/t)(s/g)AS9, is similar to the Dxx(s/t)gAT motif recognized by flavin transferase in prokaryotic proteins. Ser9 replacement abolished the flavinylation and fumarate reductase activity of FRD. These findings suggest that the flavinylation is important for the activity of FRD and that this post-translational modification is carried out by the own flavin transferase domain."
"Polymalic acid (PMA) is a water-soluble biopolymer produced by the yeast-like fungus Aureobasidium pullulans. In this study, the physiological response of A. pullulans against exogenous alcohols stress was investigated. Interestingly, ethanol stress was an effective inducer of enhanced PMA yield, although cell growth was slightly inhibited. The stress-responsive gene malate synthase (mls), which is involved in the glyoxylate shunt, was identified and was found to be regulated by exogenous ethanol stress. Therefore, an engineered strain, YJ-MLS, was constructed by overexpressing the endogenous mls gene, which increased the PMA titer by 16.2% compared with the wild-type strain. Following addition of 1% (v/v) of ethanol, a high PMA titer of 40.0?±?0.38?g/L was obtained using batch fermentation with the mutant YJ-MLS in a 5-L fermentor, with a strongest PMA productivity of 0.56?g/L h. This study was the interesting report to show strengthening of the carbon metabolic flow from the glyoxylate shunt for PMA synthesis, and also provided a new sight for re-recognizing the regulatory behavior of alcohol stress in eukaryotic microbes."
"Naturally occurring RNA carriers such as exosomes might be an untapped source of effective delivery vehicles. However, if exosomes are to be exploited for therapeutic applications, they must target specific tissues or cell types to avoid off-target effects. This study evaluated whether genetic modification of exosomes could enhance exosome delivery to heart cells and heart tissue without toxicity. Exosomes expressing cardiac-targeting peptide (CTP)-Lamp2b on the exosomal membrane (CTP-Exo) were generated by introducing vectors encoding CTP-Lamp2b into HEK 293?cells. The expression of CTP-Lamp2b peptide on exosomes was stabilized by attaching glycosylation sequences. Exosomes expressing only Lamp2b on exosomal membranes (CTL-Exo) were generated as a control. The in vitro and in vivo uptake of CTL-Exo and CTP-Exo was evaluated in cell lines and mice. Both exosomes were delivered to HEK 293 and H9C2 cells. The delivery of the exosome was not different between CTP-Exo and CTL-Exo in HEK 293?cells, whereas the delivery of CTP-Exo was 16% greater than that of CTL-Exo in H9C2 cells (P?=?0.047). Cell viability was maintained at almost 100% with different dosages of both CTL-Exo and CTP-Exo. Moreover, compared with CTL-Exo, the in vivo delivery of exosomes to the hearts of mice was increased by 15% with CTP-Exo (P?=?0.035). The delivery to livers and spleens was not different between the two exosomes. Genetic modification of exosomes by expressing CTP-Lamp2b on the exosomal membrane enhanced exosome delivery to heart cells and the heart tissue. These results suggested that CTP-Exo might be used as a therapeutic tool for heart disease."
"Intelectin is a recently characterized soluble galactofuranose-binding lectin that exists in species ranging from amphioxus to human. Interestingly, intelectin does not contain a canonical carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). Therefore, we designed serial deletions of intelectin in the Chinese amphioxus (Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtauense, AmphiITLN71469) in order to identify functional regions required for carbohydrate binding. Our results revealed that Domain 5 (aa 203-302) was able to bind lipopolysaccarides (LPS) or peptidoglycan (PGN) and agglutinate bacteria as efficiently as the full-length protein. Three dimensional (3D) atomic models of Domain 5 were generated by ab initio based program QUARK and by Iterative Threading Assembly Refinement (I-TASSER) programs, in which four amino acids mediating calcium-binding (G54-G55-G56-E91) were identified by hemagglutination assay. Furthermore, a striking functional conservation of Domain 5 was detected in zebrafish intelectin 1. Taken together, our findings identified for the first time a new CRD domain in intelectin, thereby providing new knowledge leading to a better understanding of pathogen-host interactions."
"Honeybee (Apis mellifera) egg-yolk protein vitellogenin (Vg) plays roles in immunity, antioxidation, and life span beyond reproduction, but it also acts as an allergen Api m 12 in venom. Here we established antimicrobial and antioxidant roles of honeybee Vg in the body and venom. Using the cDNA encoding Vg identified from Asiatic honeybee (A. cerana) workers, recombinant A. cerana Vg (AcVg) protein of approximately 180?kDa was produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells. In A. cerana worker bees, AcVg was expressed in the fat body and venom gland and was present in the secreted venom. AcVg induced structural damage in microbial cell walls via binding to microbial surfaces and exhibited antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi. AcVg protected mammalian and insect cells against oxidative damage through direct shielding of cell membranes. Interestingly, AcVg exhibited DNA protection activity against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, the transcript level of AcVg was upregulated in the fat body, but not in the venom gland, of worker bees with antimicrobial peptides and antioxidant enzymes in response to microbial infection and oxidative stress. Our data indicate that AcVg is involved in innate immunity upon infection and in a defense system against ROS, supporting a crucial role of honeybee Vg as an antimicrobial and antioxidant agent in the body and venom."
"Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites mainly produced by filamentous fungal species that commonly contaminate staple foods and feeds. They cause significant economic losses and greatly harm food security. Simultaneous contamination of multiple mycotoxins and the accompanying additive and synergistic effects may cause even more serious harm. To develop a microbial consortium with the ability to degrade multiple mycotoxins, a previously identified consortium with aflatoxin B1(AFB1) degradation ability, TADC7, was domesticated by co-culturing with 500??g?l-1AFB1and 500??g?l-1zearalenone (ZEA), yielding the derived microbial consortium TMDC. After 168?h of co-culture with TMDC, 2000??g?l-1AFB1and 2000??g?l-1?ZEA were degraded by 98.9% and 88.5%, respectively. The proteins or enzymes in the TADC7 cell-free supernatant played a major role in mycotoxins degradation. The degradation ratios of 5000??g?l-1AFB1and 5000??g?l-1?ZEA by 48?h TMDC cell-free supernatant were 93.8% and 90.3% at 72?h, respectively. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, Geobacillus and Tepidimicrobium might play important roles in mycotoxin degradation by TMDC, and the TMDC community composition was stable, irrespective of mycotoxin. This study established the biodegradation of different categories of mycotoxins, and will facilitate the practical application of microbial consortia in mycotoxin degradation."
"Type II NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (NDH-2) is a proposed drug-target of major pathogenic microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum. Many NDH-2 inhibitors have been identified, but rational drug development is impeded by the lack of information regarding their mode of action and associated inhibitor-bound NDH-2 structure. We have determined the crystal structure of NDH-2 complexed with a quinolone inhibitor 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO). HQNO is nested into the slot-shaped tunnel of the Q-site, in which the quinone-head group is clamped by Q317 and I379 residues, and hydrogen-bonds to FAD. The interaction of HQNO with bacterial NDH-2 is very similar to the native substrate ubiquinone (UQ1) interactions in the yeast Ndi1-UQ1complex structure, suggesting a conserved mechanism for quinone binding. Further, the structural analysis provided insight how modifications of quinolone scaffolds improve potency (e.g. quinolinyl pyrimidine derivatives) and suggests unexplored target space for the rational design of new NDH-2 inhibitors."
"Dysfunction of the neuronal RNA binding protein RBFOX1 has been linked to epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders. Rbfox1 loss in mice leads to neuronal hyper-excitability and seizures, but the physiological basis for this is unknown. We identify the vSNARE protein Vamp1 as a major Rbfox1 target. Vamp1 is strongly downregulated in Rbfox1 Nes-cKO mice due to loss of 3' UTR binding by RBFOX1. Cytoplasmic Rbfox1 stimulates Vamp1 expression in part by blocking microRNA-9. We find that Vamp1 is specifically expressed in inhibitory neurons, and that both Vamp1 knockdown and Rbfox1 loss lead to decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission and E/I imbalance. Re-expression of Vamp1 selectively within interneurons rescues the electrophysiological changes in the Rbfox1 cKO, indicating that Vamp1 loss is a major contributor to the Rbfox1 Nes-cKO phenotype. The regulation of interneuron-specific Vamp1 by Rbfox1 provides a paradigm for broadly expressed RNA-binding proteins performing specialized functions in defined neuronal subtypes."
"As the mammalian outer retina develops, rod and cone photoreceptors synapse with their respective bipolar cells. Sarin et al. (2018) develop a somatic CRISPR technique to determine how genes differentially expressed among the four cell types mediate outer retina development."
"Inflammation affects regeneration of the intestinal epithelia; long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate cell functions such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. We investigated the mechanisms by which the lncRNA H19, imprinted maternally expressed transcript (H19) regulates regeneration of intestinal epithelium using cell cultures and mouse models of inflammation.We performed RNA-seq transcriptome analyses of intestinal tissues from mice with LPS-induced sepsis to identify lncRNAs associated with inflammation; findings were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization analyses of intestinal tissues from mice with sepsis or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mucosal wound healing and patients with ulcerative colitis, compared to healthy individuals (controls). We screened cytokines for their ability to induce expression of H19 in HT-29 cells and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), and confirmed findings in crypt epithelial organoids derived from mouse small intestine. IECs were incubated with different signal transduction inhibitors and effects on H19 lncRNA levels were measured. We assessed intestinal epithelial proliferation or regeneration in H19?Ex1/+mice given lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or DSS vs wild-type littermates (control mice). H19 was overexpressed in IECs using lentiviral vectors and cell proliferation was measured. We performed RNA antisense purification, RNA immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assays to study functions of H19 in IECs.In RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of lncRNA expression in intestinal tissues from mice, we found levels of only H19 to change significantly with LPS exposure. Levels of H19 lncRNA increased in intestinal tissues of patients with ulcerative colitis, mice with LPS-induced sepsis, or mice with DSS-induced colitis, compared with controls. Increased H19 lncRNA localized to epithelial cells in the intestine, regardless of Lgr5 mRNA expression. Exposure of IECs to interleukin 22 (IL22) increased levels of H19 lncRNA with time and dose, which required STAT3 and PKA activity. IL22 induced expression of H19 in mouse intestinal epithelial organoids within 6 hours. Exposure to IL22 increased growth of intestinal epithelial organoids derived from control mice but not H19?Ex1/+mice. Overexpression of H19 in HT-29 cells increased their proliferation. Intestinal mucosa healed more slowly after withdrawal of DSS from H19?Ex1/+mice vs control mice. Crypt epithelial cells from H19?Ex1/+mice proliferated more slowly than those from control mice after exposure to LPS. H19 lncRNA bound to p53 and microRNAs that inhibit cell proliferation, including microRNA 34a and let-7; H19 lncRNA binding blocked their function, leading to increased expression of genes that promote regeneration of the epithelium.The level of lncRNA H19 is increased in inflamed intestinal tissues from mice and patients. The inflammatory cytokine IL22 induces expression of H19 in IECs, which is required for intestinal epithelial proliferation and mucosal healing. H19 lncRNA appears to inhibit p53 protein and microRNA 34a and let-7 to promote proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and epithelial regeneration."
"We reported previously that when C57BL/6 (B6) mice ingest glucose, plasma insulin levels rise above baseline before blood glucose levels do so. This observation led us to speculate that the taste of glucose elicits cephalic-phase insulin release (CPIR) in mice. Here, we examined the specific contributions of taste and glucose to CPIR. In Experiment 1, we bypassed the mouth and delivered glucose directly to the stomach. We found that plasma insulin levels did not rise above baseline until after blood glucose levels did so. This revealed that taste stimulation is necessary for rapid insulin release (i.e., CPIR) in mice. In Experiment 2, we examined the observation that sucrose, maltose and Polycose (a maltodextrin) all elicit CPIR. We proposed in a prior study that these carbohydrates did not directly elicit CPIR; instead, they were digested by oral amylases and alpha-glucosidases, and that it was the enzymatically liberated glucose that elicited CPIR. In support of this possibility, we reported in this prior study that acarbose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor) prevented sucrose, maltose and Polycose from eliciting CPIR. Here, we sought to confirm that glucose alone could elicit CPIR in the presence of acarbose. Indeed, we found that glucose alone and glucose+acarbose each elicited equally robust CPIR. Taken together, these results provide further support for the hypothesis that mice possess a glucose-specific taste transduction pathway that triggers rapid insulin release."
"Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, including degenerative TMJ disease, occur primarily in women of reproductive age. Previous studies showed elevated estrogen levels in subjects with TMJ disorders relative to controls and the presence of estrogen receptors ? and ? (ER? and ER?) in TMJ fibrocartilage. Additionally, estrogen-induced overexpression of specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-9 and MMP-13, in TMJ fibrocartilage is accompanied by loss of extracellular matrices. However, the contribution of ER? and ER? in estrogen-mediated induction of MMP-9 and MMP-13 and the signaling cascade leading to the upregulation of these MMPs have not been elucidated. Here, we show that specific siRNAs and selective ER antagonists effectively block ER? or ER? expression in primary mouse TMJ fibrochondrocytes, but that only blockage of ER? suppresses MMP-9 and MMP-13 levels induced by 17?-estradiol (E2). Overexpression of ER? but not ER? enhances E2-induced MMP-9. Using the same loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that E2 stimulates ERK activation through ER? and that inhibition of ERK phosphorylation reduces E2-induced MMP-9. Furthermore, we reveal that E2 promotes NF-?B and ELK-1 activation through ER?/ERK signaling and that knockdown of either one decreases the respective activity of these signaling mediators and MMP-9 expression induced by E2, indicating that both contribute to E2/ER?/ERK-mediated MMP-9 upregulation. This is supported by findings in which mutated binding sites of either NF-?B or ELK-1 in the MMP-9 promoter lead to a significant reduction of E2-stimulated promoter activity. Our findings provide novel molecular mechanisms for the understanding of E2-mediated upregulation of MMPs, having implications to pathophysiologic TMJ cartilage matrix turnover that may yield therapeutic intervention targets for TMJ disorders."
"Setaria viridis is one of the most important model grasses in studying monocot plant biology. Transient gene expression study is a very important tool in plant biotechnology, functional genomics, and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology via particle bombardment. In this study, a particle bombardment-mediated protocol was developed to introduce DNA into Setaria viridis in vitro leaf explants. In addition, physical and biological parameters, such as helium pressure, distance from stopping screen to the target tissues, DNA concentration, and number of bombardments, were tested and optimized. Optimum concentration of transient GFP expression was achieved using 1.5 ug plasmid DNA with 0.6mm gold particles and 6 cm bombardment distance, using 1,100 psi. Doubling the bombardment instances provides the maximum number of foci of transient GFP expression. This simple protocol will be helpful for genomics studies in the S. viridis monocot model."
"The role of the c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) signaling pathway in tumor progression and invasion has been extensively studied. C-MET inhibitors have shown anti-tumor activity in NSCLC both in preclinical and in clinical trials. However, given the molecular heterogeneity of NSCLC, it is likely that only a specific subset of NSCLC patients will benefit from c-MET inhibitors. Emerging data also suggest that MET inhibitors in combination with EGFR-TKIs (epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors) may have a role in therapy for both EGFR-TKI resistant and EGFR-TKI naïve patients. The challenges ahead are in the identification of the molecular subtypes that benefit most. Areas covered: This review summarizes the current understanding of c-MET biology in relation to studies evaluating c-MET inhibitors in the treatment of NSCLC. Expert opinion: MET inhibitors have the potential to benefit subsets of NSCLC patients with specific genetic alterations. Exon-14 skipping mutations appear so far to be the most promising molecular subset that is sensitive to MET inhibitors, whereas overexpression, amplification and point mutations of MET seem more challenging subgroups to target. Combination with other target agents, such as EGFR inhibitors, may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in specific areas (e.g. EGFR-TKI resistance)."
"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines have horizontal or upright static magnetic field (SMF) of 0.1-3 T (Tesla) at sites of patients and operators, but the biological effects of these SMFs still remain elusive. We examined 12 different cell lines, including 5 human solid tumor cell lines, 2 human leukemia cell lines and 4 human non-cancer cell lines, as well as the Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Permanent magnets were used to provide 0.2-1 T SMFs with different magnetic field directions. We found that an upward magnetic field of 0.2-1 T could effectively reduce the cell numbers of all human solid tumor cell lines we tested, but a downward magnetic field mostly had no statistically significant effect. However, the leukemia cells in suspension, which do not have shape-induced anisotropy, were inhibited by both upward and downward magnetic fields. In contrast, the cell numbers of most non-cancer cells were not affected by magnetic fields of all directions. Moreover, the upward magnetic field inhibited GIST-T1 tumor growth in nude mice by 19.3% (p < 0.05) while the downward magnetic field did not produce significant effect. In conclusion, although still lack of mechanistical insights, our results show that different magnetic field directions produce divergent effects on cancer cell numbers as well as tumor growth in mice. This not only verified the safety of SMF exposure related to current MRI machines but also revealed the possible antitumor potential of magnetic field with an upward direction."
"The genetic, molecular and neuronal mechanism underlying circadian activity rhythms is well characterized in the brain of Drosophila. The small ventrolateral neurons (s-LNVs) and pigment dispersing factor (PDF) expressed by them are especially important for regulating circadian locomotion. Here we describe a novel gene, Dstac, which is similar to the stac genes found in vertebrates that encode adaptor proteins, which bind and regulate L-type voltage-gated Ca2+channels (CaChs). We show that Dstac is coexpressed with PDF by the s-LNVs and regulates circadian activity. Furthermore, the L-type CaCh, Dmca1D, appears to be expressed by the s-LNVs. Since vertebrate Stac3 regulates an L-type CaCh we hypothesize that Dstac regulates Dmca1D in s-LNVs and circadian activity."
"There is a need for flexible and affordable plant phenotyping solutions for basic research and plant breeding. We demonstrate our open source plant imaging and processing solution ('PhenoBox'/'PhenoPipe') and provide construction plans, source code and documentation to rebuild the system. Use of the PhenoBox is exemplified by studying infection of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon by the head smut fungus Ustilago bromivora, comparing phenotypic responses of maize to infection with a solopathogenic Ustilago maydis (corn smut) strain and effector deletion strains, and studying salt stress response in Nicotiana benthamiana. In U. bromivora-infected grass, phenotypic differences between infected and uninfected plants were detectable weeks before qualitative head smut symptoms. Based on this, we could predict the infection outcome for individual plants with high accuracy. Using a PhenoPipe module for calculation of multi-dimensional distances from phenotyping data, we observe a time after infection-dependent impact of U. maydis effector deletion strains on phenotypic response in maize. The PhenoBox/PhenoPipe system is able to detect established salt stress responses in N. benthamiana. We have developed an affordable, automated, open source imaging and data processing solution that can be adapted to various phenotyping applications in plant biology and beyond."
"Fossils entombed in amber are a unique resource for reconstructing forest ecosystems, and resolving relationships of modern taxa. Such fossils are famous for their perfect, life-like appearance. However, preservation quality is vast with many sites showing only cuticular preservation, or no fossils. The taphonomic processes that control this range are largely unknown; as such, we know little about potential bias in this important record. Here we employ actualistic experiments, using, fruit flies and modern tree resin to determine whether resin type, gut microbiota, and dehydration prior to entombment affects decay. We used solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) to confirm distinct tree resin chemistry; gut microbiota of flies was modified using antibiotics and categorized though sequencing. Decay was assessed using phase contrast synchrotron tomography. Resin type demonstrates a significant control on decay rate. The composition of the gut microbiota was also influential, with minor changes in composition affecting decay rate. Dehydration prior to entombment, contrary to expectations, enhanced decay. Our analyses show that there is potential significant bias in the amber fossil record, especially between sites with different resin types where ecological completeness and preservational fidelity are likely affected."
"Mammalian carnivores can be particularly sensitive to human disturbance, even within protected areas (PAs). Our objective was to understand how human disturbance affects carnivore communities in southern Arizona, USA by studying habitat occupancy based on data collected using non-invasive methods in three PAs with different levels of human disturbance. Carnivore occupancy varied based on human disturbance variables (i.e., roads, trails, etc.). Common carnivore species (coyotes, gray foxes, and bobcats) had high occupancy probability in highly disturbed sites, while all other carnivore species had a higher probability of occupancy in low disturbance protected areas. Additionally, overall carnivore diversity was higher in PAs with low human disturbance. Edges of PAs appeared to negatively impact occupancy of nearly all carnivore species. We also found the presence of roads and trails, and not necessarily how much they are used, had a significant negative impact on the occupancy of most carnivore species. Furthermore, the overall level of disturbance within a PA influenced how sensitive carnivores were to human disturbance variables. Carnivores were more sensitive in PAs with higher levels of disturbance and were relatively unaffected by disturbance variables in a PA with low base levels of disturbance. Increased visitation to PAs, expected with the region's high level of population growth, is likely to cause shifts in the carnivore communities favoring species that are less sensitive to disturbance."
"The waste of commonly used medicines is known to contaminate freshwater ecosystems. Pharmaceuticals can be toxic, mutagenic, or modifying to freshwater organisms even at low concentrations if consider their permanent presence in the environment. Chemotherapeutics used to treat cancer, and in particular alkylating agents, contribute significantly to this form of pollution, the latter introducing cytotoxic and/or mutagenic lesions to the DNA and RNA of organisms which can be disruptive to their cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the alkylating anticancer agent cyclophosphamide (CP) on Daphnia magna clones. We evaluated the life history parameters and protein profiles of this crustacean following exposure to environmentally relevant CP concentration of 10 ng L-1. Even at this low concentration, the alkylating agent caused modification of the life history parameters and proteome profile of the Daphnia. These changes were clone-specific and involved growth rate, age at first reproduction, neonate number, and proteins related to cell cycle and redox state regulation. The disturbance caused by pharmaceuticals contaminating freshwater ecosystem is probably weaker and unlikely to be cytotoxic in character due to the high dilution of these substances in the water. However, our results indicate that prolonged exposure of organisms to these toxins may lead to modifications on the organismal and molecular levels with unpredictable significance for the entire ecosystem."
"We report the first genetic identification of eggs of four species of Anguilliformes caught in the northern East China Sea during August 2016, where leptocephali and adults have been collected. The species were Ophisurus macrorhynchos and Echelus uropterus belonging to the Ophichthidae, and Ariosoma majus and Gnathophis heterognathos belonging to the Congridae. The eggs were identified using three molecular genetic markers (mitochondrial 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1), sequences obtained from local adult specimens, and geographical distribution data. All eggs were in the early or middle developmental stages. For all species except A. majus, the eggs were found near the range of small leptocephali in the East China Sea and the southern Korean Peninsula, which indicates these species had spawned along the continental near these areas during the summer."
"Anti-predator signaling is highly variable with numerous examples of species employing cryptic coloration to avoid detection or conspicuous coloration (often coupled with a secondary defense) to ensure detection and recollection. While the ends of this spectrum are clear in their function, how species use intermediate signals is less clear. Australian Brood Frogs (Pseudophryne) display conspicuous coloration on both their dorsum and venter. Coupled with the alkaloid toxins these frogs possess, this coloration may be aposematic, providing a protective warning signal to predators. We assessed predation rates of known and novel color patterns and found no difference for avian or mammalian predators. However, when Pseudophryne dorsal phenotypes were collectively compared to the high-contrast ventral phenotype of this genus, we found birds, but not mammals, attacked dorsal phenotypes significantly less frequently than the ventral phenotype. This study, importantly, shows a differential predator response to ventral coloration in this genus which has implications for the evolution of conspicuous signaling in Pseudophryne."
"DNA methylation is mediated by a conserved family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts). The human genome encodes three active Dnmts (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b), the tRNA methyltransferase Dnmt2, and the regulatory protein Dnmt3L. Despite their high degree of conservation among different species, genes encoding Dnmts have been duplicated and/or lost in multiple lineages throughout evolution, indicating that the DNA methylation machinery has some potential to undergo evolutionary change. However, little is known about the extent to which this machinery, or the methylome, varies among vertebrates. Here, we study the molecular evolution of Dnmt1, the enzyme responsible for maintenance of DNA methylation patterns after replication, in 79 vertebrate species. Our analyses show that all studied species exhibit a single copy of the DNMT1 gene, with the exception of tilapia and marsupials (tammar wallaby, koala, Tasmanian devil and opossum), each of which displays two apparently functional DNMT1 copies. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that DNMT1 duplicated before the radiation of major marsupial groups (i.e., at least ~75 million years ago), thus giving rise to two DNMT1 copies in marsupials (copy 1 and copy 2). In the opossum lineage, copy 2 was lost, and copy 1 recently duplicated again, generating three DNMT1 copies: two putatively functional genes (copy 1a and 1b) and one pseudogene (copy 1?). Both marsupial copies (DNMT1 copies 1 and 2) are under purifying selection, and copy 2 exhibits elevated rates of evolution and signatures of positive selection, suggesting a scenario of neofunctionalization. This gene duplication might have resulted in modifications in marsupial methylomes and their dynamics."
"We sought to identify biomarkers which delineated individual hypertrophic responses to resistance training. Untrained, college-aged males engaged in full-body resistance training (3 d/wk) for 12 weeks. Body composition via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL) thickness via ultrasound, blood, VL muscle biopsies, and three-repetition maximum (3-RM) squat strength were obtained prior to (PRE) and following (POST) 12 weeks of training. K-means cluster analysis based on VL thickness changes identified LOW [n = 17; change (mean±SD) = +0.11±0.14 cm], modest (MOD; n = 29, +0.40±0.06 cm), and high (HI; n = 21, +0.69±0.14 cm) responders. Biomarkers related to histology, ribosome biogenesis, proteolysis, inflammation, and androgen signaling were analyzed between clusters. There were main effects of time (POST>PRE, p<0.05) but no cluster×time interactions for increases in DXA lean body mass, type I and II muscle fiber cross sectional area and myonuclear number, satellite cell number, and macronutrients consumed. Interestingly, PRE VL thickness was ~12% greater in LOW versus HI (p = 0.021), despite POST values being ~12% greater in HI versus LOW (p = 0.006). However there was only a weak correlation between PRE VL thickness scores and change in VL thickness (r2 = 0.114, p = 0.005). Forced post hoc analysis indicated that muscle total RNA levels (i.e., ribosome density) did not significantly increase in the LOW cluster (351±70 ng/mg to 380±62, p = 0.253), but increased in the MOD (369±115 to 429±92, p = 0.009) and HI clusters (356±77 to 470±134, p<0.001; POST HI>POST LOW, p = 0.013). Nonetheless, there was only a weak association between change in muscle total RNA and VL thickness (r2 = 0.079, p = 0.026). IL-1? mRNA levels decreased in the MOD and HI clusters following training (p<0.05), although associations between this marker and VL thickness changes were not significant (r2 = 0.0002, p = 0.919). In conclusion, individuals with lower pre-training VL thickness values and greater increases muscle total RNA levels following 12 weeks of resistance training experienced greater VL muscle growth, although these biomarkers individually explained only ~8-11% of the variance in hypertrophy."
"Animal models commonly serve as a bridge between in vitro experiments and clinical applications; however, few physiological processes in adult animals are sufficient to serve as proof-of-concept models for cartilage regeneration. Intriguingly, some rodents, such as young adult mice, undergo physiological connective tissue modifications to birth canal elements such as the pubic symphysis during pregnancy; therefore, we investigated whether the differential expression of cartilage differentiation markers is associated with cartilaginous tissue morphological modifications during these changes. Our results showed that osteochondral progenitor cells expressing Runx2, Sox9, Col2a1 and Dcx at the non-pregnant pubic symphysis proliferated and differentiated throughout pregnancy, giving rise to a complex osteoligamentous junction that attached the interpubic ligament to the pubic bones until labour occurred. After delivery, the recovery of pubic symphysis cartilaginous tissues was improved by the time-dependent expression of these chondrocytic lineage markers at the osteoligamentous junction. This process potentially recapitulates embryologic chondrocytic differentiation to successfully recover hyaline cartilaginous pads at 10 days postpartum. Therefore, we propose that this physiological phenomenon represents a proof-of-concept model for investigating the mechanisms involved in cartilage restoration in adult animals."
"Viral vectors are extensively purified for use in biomedical research, in order to separate biologically active virus particles and to eliminate production related impurities that are assumed to be detrimental to the host. For recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors this is typically accomplished using density gradient-based methods, which are tedious and require specialized ultracentrifugation equipment. In order to streamline the preparation of rAAV vectors for pilot and small animal studies, we recently devised a simple ultrafiltration approach that permits rapid virus concentration and partial removal of production-related impurities. Here we show that systemic administration of such rapidly prepared (RP) rAAV8 vectors in mice is safe and efficiently transduces the liver. Across a range of doses, delivery of RP rAAV8-CMV-eGFP vector induced enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression in liver that was comparable to that obtained from a conventional iodixanol gradient-purified (IP) vector. Surprisingly, no liver inflammation or systemic cytokine induction was detected in RP rAAV injected animals, revealing that residual impurities in the viral vector preparation are not deleterious to the host. Together, these data demonstrate that partially purified rAAV vector can be safely and effectively administered in vivo. The speed and versatility of the RP method and lack of need for cumbersome density gradients or expensive ultracentrifuge equipment will enable more widespread use of RP prepared rAAV vectors, such as for pilot liver gene transfer studies."
"Hadal trenches, oceanic locations deeper than 6,000 m, are thought to have distinct microbial communities compared to those at shallower depths due to high hydrostatic pressures, topographical funneling of organic matter, and biogeographical isolation. Here we evaluate the hypothesis that hadal trenches contain unique microbial biodiversity through analyses of the communities present in the bottom waters of the Kermadec and Mariana trenches. Estimates of microbial protein production indicate active populations under in situ hydrostatic pressures and increasing adaptation to pressure with depth. Depth, trench of collection, and size fraction are important drivers of microbial community structure. Many putative hadal bathytypes, such as members related to the Marinimicrobia, Rhodobacteraceae, Rhodospirilliceae, and Aquibacter, are similar to members identified in other trenches. Most of the differences between the two trench microbiomes consists of taxa belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria whose distributions extend throughout the water column. Growth and survival estimates of representative isolates of these taxa under deep-sea conditions suggest that some members may descend from shallower depths and exist as a potentially inactive fraction of the hadal zone. We conclude that the distinct pelagic communities residing in these two trenches, and perhaps by extension other trenches, reflect both cosmopolitan hadal bathytypes and ubiquitous genera found throughout the water column."
"Next-generation sequencing can be costly and labour intensive. Usually, the sequencing cost per sample is reduced by pooling amplified DNA = amplicons) derived from different individuals on the same sequencing lane. Barcodes unique to each amplicon permit short-read sequences to be assigned appropriately. However, the cost of the library preparation increases with the number of barcodes used. We propose an alternative to barcoding: by using different known proportions of individually-derived amplicons in a pooled sample, each is characterised a priori by an expected depth of coverage. We have developed a Hidden Markov Model that uses these expected proportions to reconstruct the input sequences. We apply this method to pools of mitochondrial DNA amplicons extracted from kangaroo meat, genus Macropus. Our experiments indicate that the sequence coverage can be efficiently used to index the short-reads and that we can reassemble the input haplotypes when secondary factors impacting the coverage are controlled. We therefore demonstrate that, by combining our approach with standard barcoding, the cost of the library preparation is reduced to a third."
"This study considered all articles published in six Public Library of Science (PLOS) journals in 2012 and Web of Science citations for these articles as of May 2015. A total of 2,406 articles were analyzed to examine the relationships between Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS) and Web of Science citations. The AAS for an article, provided by Altmetric aggregates activities surrounding research outputs in social media (news outlet mentions, tweets, blogs, Wikipedia, etc.). Spearman correlation testing was done on all articles and articles with AAS. Further analysis compared the stratified datasets based on percentile ranks of AAS: top 50%, top 25%, top 10%, and top 1%. Comparisons across the six journals provided additional insights. The results show significant positive correlations between AAS and citations with varied strength for all articles and articles with AAS (or social media mentions), as well as for normalized AAS in the top 50%, top 25%, top 10%, and top 1% datasets. Four of the six PLOS journals, Genetics, Pathogens, Computational Biology, and Neglected Tropical Diseases, show significant positive correlations across all datasets. However, for the two journals with high impact factors, PLOS Biology and Medicine, the results are unexpected: the Medicine articles showed no significant correlations but the Biology articles tested positive for correlations with the whole dataset and the set with AAS. Both journals published substantially fewer articles than the other four journals. Further research to validate the AAS algorithm, adjust the weighting scheme, and include appropriate social media sources is needed to understand the potential uses and meaning of AAS in different contexts and its relationship to other metrics."
"Animal growth is influenced by the genetic background and the environmental circumstances. How genes promote growth and coordinate adaptation to nutrient availability is still an open question. p53 is a transcription factor that commands the cellular response to different types of stresses. In adult Drosophila melanogaster, p53 regulates the metabolic adaptation to nutrient restriction that supports fly viability. Furthermore, the larval brain is protected from nutrient restriction in a phenomenon called 'brain sparing'. Therefore, we hypothesised that p53 may regulate brain growth and show a protective role over brain development under nutrient restriction.Here, we studied the function of p53 during brain growth in normal conditions and in animals subjected to developmental nutrient restriction. We showed that p53 loss of function reduced animal growth and larval brain size. Endogenous p53 was expressed in larval neural stem cells, but its levels and activity were not affected by nutritional stress. Interestingly, p53 knockdown only in neural stem cells was sufficient to decrease larval brain growth. Finally, we showed that in p53 mutant larvae under nutrient restriction, the energy storage levels were not altered, and these larvae generated adults with brains of similar size than wild-type animals.Using genetic approaches, we demonstrate that p53 is required for proper growth of the larval brain. This developmental role of p53 does not have an impact on animal resistance to nutritional stress since brain growth in p53 mutants under nutrient restriction is similar to control animals."
"Mechanisms generating diverse cell types from multipotent progenitors are fundamental for normal development. Pigment cells are derived from multipotent neural crest cells and their diversity in teleosts provides an excellent model for studying mechanisms controlling fate specification of distinct cell types. Zebrafish have three types of pigment cells (melanocytes, iridophores and xanthophores) while medaka have four (three shared with zebrafish, plus leucophores), raising questions about how conserved mechanisms of fate specification of each pigment cell type are in these fish. We have previously shown that the Sry-related transcription factor Sox10 is crucial for fate specification of pigment cells in zebrafish, and that Sox5 promotes xanthophores and represses leucophores in a shared xanthophore/leucophore progenitor in medaka. Employing TILLING, TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies, we generated medaka and zebrafish sox5 and sox10 mutants and conducted comparative analyses of their compound mutant phenotypes. We show that specification of all pigment cells, except leucophores, is dependent on Sox10. Loss of Sox5 in Sox10-defective fish partially rescued the formation of all pigment cells in zebrafish, and melanocytes and iridophores in medaka, suggesting that Sox5 represses Sox10-dependent formation of these pigment cells, similar to their interaction in mammalian melanocyte specification. In contrast, in medaka, loss of Sox10 acts cooperatively with Sox5, enhancing both xanthophore reduction and leucophore increase in sox5 mutants. Misexpression of Sox5 in the xanthophore/leucophore progenitors increased xanthophores and reduced leucophores in medaka. Thus, the mode of Sox5 function in xanthophore specification differs between medaka (promoting) and zebrafish (repressing), which is also the case in adult fish. Our findings reveal surprising diversity in even the mode of the interactions between Sox5 and Sox10 governing specification of pigment cell types in medaka and zebrafish, and suggest that this is related to the evolution of a fourth pigment cell type."
"The ability of clonal bacterial populations to generate genomic and phenotypic heterogeneity is thought to be of great importance for many commensal and pathogenic bacteria. One common mechanism contributing to diversity formation relies on the inversion of small genomic DNA segments in a process commonly referred to as conservative site-specific recombination. This phenomenon is known to occur in several bacterial lineages, however it remains notoriously difficult to identify due to the lack of conserved features. Here, we report an easy-to-implement method based on high-throughput paired-end sequencing for genome-wide detection of conservative site-specific recombination on a single-nucleotide level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by successfully detecting several novel inversion sites in an epidemic isolate of the enteric pathogen Clostridium difficile. Using an experimental approach, we validate the inversion potential of all detected sites in C. difficile and quantify their prevalence during exponential and stationary growth in vitro. In addition, we demonstrate that the master recombinase RecV is responsible for the inversion of some but not all invertible sites. Using a fluorescent gene-reporter system, we show that at least one gene from a two-component system located next to an invertible site is expressed in an on-off mode reminiscent of phase variation. We further demonstrate the applicability of our method by mining 209 publicly available sequencing datasets and show that conservative site-specific recombination is common in the bacterial realm but appears to be absent in some lineages. Finally, we show that the gene content associated with the inversion sites is diverse and goes beyond traditionally described surface components. Overall, our method provides a robust platform for detection of conservative site-specific recombination in bacteria and opens a new avenue for global exploration of this important phenomenon."
"Activation of the amino acid starvation response (AAR) increases lifespan and acute stress resistance as well as regulates inflammation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that activation of AAR pharmacologically by Halofuginone (HF) significantly inhibits production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1? (IL-1?) and provides protection from intestinal inflammation in mice. HF inhibits IL-1? through general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2)-dependent activation of the cytoprotective integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, resulting in rerouting of IL-1? mRNA from translationally active polysomes to inactive ribocluster complexes-such as stress granules (SGs)-via recruitment of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) T cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1(TIA-1)/TIA-1-related (TIAR), which are further cleared through induction of autophagy. GCN2 ablation resulted in reduced autophagy and SG formation, which is inversely correlated with IL-1? production. Furthermore, HF diminishes inflammasome activation through suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our study unveils a novel mechanism by which IL-1? is regulated by AAR and further suggests that administration of HF might offer an effective therapeutic intervention against inflammatory diseases."
"Hyperostosis Cranialis Interna (HCI) is a rare bone disorder characterized by progressive intracranial bone overgrowth at the skull. Here we identified by whole-exome sequencing a dominant mutation (L441R) in SLC39A14 (ZIP14). We show that L441R ZIP14 is no longer trafficked towards the plasma membrane and excessively accumulates intracellular zinc, resulting in hyper-activation of cAMP-CREB and NFAT signaling. Conditional knock-in mice overexpressing L438R Zip14 in osteoblasts have a severe skeletal phenotype marked by a drastic increase in cortical thickness due to an enhanced endosteal bone formation, resembling the underlying pathology in HCI patients. Remarkably, L438R Zip14 also generates an osteoporotic trabecular bone phenotype. The effects of osteoblastic overexpression of L438R Zip14 therefore mimic the disparate actions of estrogen on cortical and trabecular bone through osteoblasts. Collectively, we reveal ZIP14 as a novel regulator of bone homeostasis, and that manipulating ZIP14 might be a therapeutic strategy for bone diseases."
"Metabolomics, in which small-molecule metabolites (the metabolome) are identified and quantified, is broadly acknowledged to be the omics discipline that is closest to the phenotype. Although appreciated for its role in biomarker discovery programs, metabolomics can also be used to identify metabolites that could alter a cell's or an organism's phenotype. Metabolomics activity screening (MAS) as described here integrates metabolomics data with metabolic pathways and systems biology information, including proteomics and transcriptomics data, to produce a set of endogenous metabolites that can be tested for functionality in altering phenotypes. A growing literature reports the use of metabolites to modulate diverse processes, such as stem cell differentiation, oligodendrocyte maturation, insulin signaling, T-cell survival and macrophage immune responses. This opens up the possibility of identifying and applying metabolites to affect phenotypes. Unlike genes or proteins, metabolites are often readily available, which means that MAS is broadly amenable to high-throughput screening of virtually any biological system."
"In contrast to several smaller studies, which demonstrate that remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) reduces myocardial injury in patients that undergo cardiovascular surgery, the RIPHeart study failed to demonstrate beneficial effects of troponin release and clinical outcome in propofol-anesthetized cardiac surgery patients. Therefore, we addressed the potential biochemical mechanisms triggered by RIPC. This is a predefined prospective sub-analysis of the randomized and controlled RIPHeart study in cardiac surgery patients (n= 40) that was recently published. Blood samples were drawn from patients prior to surgery, after RIPC of four cycles of 5 min arm ischemia/5 min reperfusion (n= 19) and the sham (n= 21) procedure, after connection to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), at the end of surgery, 24 h postoperatively, and 48 h postoperatively for the measurement of troponin T, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stromal cell-derived factor 1 (CXCL12), IL-6, CXCL8, and IL-10. After RIPC, right atrial tissue samples were taken for the measurement of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2), protein kinase B (AKT), Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3?), protein kinase C (PKC?), and MIF content. RIPC did not significantly reduce the troponin release when compared with the sham procedure. MIF serum levels intraoperatively increased, peaking at intensive care unit (ICU) admission (with an increase of 48.04%,p= 0.164 in RIPC; and 69.64%,p= 0.023 over the baseline in the sham procedure), and decreased back to the baseline 24 h after surgery, with no differences between the groups. In the right atrial tissue, MIF content decreased after RIPC (1.040 ± 1.032 Arbitrary units [au] in RIPC vs. 2.028 ± 1.631 [au] in the sham procedure,p< 0.05). CXCL12 serum levels increased significantly over the baseline at the end of surgery, with no differences between the groups. ERK1/2, AKT, GSK-3?, and PKC?phosphorylation in the right atrial samples were no different between the groups. No difference was found in IL-6, CXCL8, and IL10 serum levels between the groups. In this cohort of cardiac surgery patients that received propofol anesthesia, we could not show a release of potential mediators of signaling, nor an effect on the inflammatory response, nor an activation of well-established protein kinases after RIPC. Based on these data, we cannot exclude that confounding factors, such as propofol, may have interfered with RIPC."
"Phage therapy is increasingly put forward as a ""new"" potential tool in the fight against antibiotic resistant infections. During the ""Centennial Celebration of Bacteriophage Research"" conference in Tbilisi, Georgia on 26-29 June 2017, an international group of phage researchers committed to elaborate an expert opinion on three contentious phage therapy related issues that are hampering clinical progress in the field of phage therapy. This paper explores and discusses bacterial phage resistance, phage training and the presence of prophages in bacterial production strains while reviewing relevant research findings and experiences. Our purpose is to inform phage therapy stakeholders such as policy makers, officials of the competent authorities for medicines, phage researchers and phage producers, and members of the pharmaceutical industry. This brief also points out potential avenues for future phage therapy research and development as it specifically addresses those overarching questions that currently call for attention whenever phages go into purification processes for application."
"Noncanonical WNT pathways function independently of the ?-catenin transcriptional co-activator to regulate diverse morphogenetic and pathogenic processes. Recent studies showed that noncanonical WNTs, such as WNT5A, can signal the degradation of several downstream effectors, thereby modulating these effectors' cellular activities. The protein domain(s) that mediates the WNT5A-dependent degradation response, however, has not been identified. By coupling protein mutagenesis experiments with a flow cytometry-based degradation reporter assay, we have defined a protein domain in the kinesin superfamily protein KIF26B that is essential for WNT5A-dependent degradation. We found that a human disease-causing KIF26B mutation located at a conserved amino acid within this domain compromises the ability of WNT5A to induce KIF26B degradation. Using pharmacological perturbation, we further uncovered a role of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) in WNT5A regulation of KIF26B degradation. Lastly, based on the identification of the WNT5A-responsive domain, we developed a new reporter system that allows for efficient profiling of WNT5A-KIF26B signaling activity in both somatic and stem cells. In conclusion, our study identifies a new protein domain that mediates WNT5A-dependent degradation of KIF26B and provides a new tool for functional characterization of noncanonical WNT5A signaling in cells."
"The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) adaptive immune system has been extensively used for gene editing, including gene deletion, insertion, and replacement in bacterial and eukaryotic cells owing to its simple, rapid, and efficient activities in unprecedented resolution. Furthermore, the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system including deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) with inactivated endonuclease activity has been further investigated for regulation of the target gene transiently or constitutively, avoiding cell death by disruption of genome. This review discusses the applications of CRISPR/Cas for genome editing in various bacterial systems and their applications. In particular, CRISPR technology has been used for the production of metabolites of high industrial significance, including biochemical, biofuel, and pharmaceutical products/precursors in bacteria. Here, we focus on methods to increase the productivity and yield/titer scan by controlling metabolic flux through individual or combinatorial use of CRISPR/Cas and CRISPRi systems with introduction of synthetic pathway in industrially common bacteria includingEscherichia coli. Further, we discuss additional useful applications of the CRISPR/Cas system, including its use in functional genomics."
"The association between the Pro12Ala polymorphism of thePPAR?2gene, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and obesity in certain ethnic populations has been reported. However, this relationship has not yet been described among diabetes patients in Nigeria. This study investigated the relationship between the Pro12Ala polymorphism in thePPAR?2gene, obesity, and lipid abnormalities characterizing T2D among patients in Nigeria. This case-control study recruited 73 T2D and 75 non-diabetic (ND) patients. Demographic and clinical data were collected and blood glucose levels together with serum lipid profile for patients were measured. Pro12Ala polymorphism in thePPAR?2gene was genotyped by restriction fragment length-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RFLP-PCR). ThePPAR-?2gene (amplicon size = 270 base pair) was successfully amplified for all samples. Following restriction enzyme digestion and analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis, amplicons from samples showed a band of size 270 bp and were of the wild homozygous Pro/Pro genotype. Ala12 variant was totally absent from the study population. Obesity, estimated using Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), was significantly higher (p< 0.05) in T2D patients compared to the non-diabetic patients. More so, the prevalence of lipid abnormalities; hypercholesterolaemia (TC > 200 mg/dL), hypertriglyceridaemia (TG > 150 mg/dL), high HDL (>100 mg/dL), and low HDL (<50 mg/dL) was significantly greater (p< 0.001) in T2D patients compared to non-diabetic patients. Results obtained further indicated lack of significant association betweenPPAR-?2gene polymorphism, T2D, and obesity. However, obesity and dyslipidaemia were strongly associated in T2D patients."
"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a group of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that provide innate immune sensing of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to engage early immune recognition of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Furthermore, TLRs provide a conduit for initiation of non-infectious inflammation following the sensing of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) generated as a consequence of cellular injury. Due to their essential role as DAMP and PAMP sensors, TLR signaling also contributes importantly to several systemic diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and others. The overlapping participation of TLRs in the control of infection, and pathogenesis of systemic diseases, has served as a starting point for research delving into the poorly defined area of infection leading to increased risk of various systemic diseases. Although conflicting studies exist, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and obesity/metabolic dysfunction have been associated with differing degrees of strength to infectious diseases. Here we will discuss elements of these connections focusing on the contributions of TLR signaling as a consequence of bacterial exposure in the context of the oral infections leading to periodontal disease, and associations with metabolic diseases including atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes."
"Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have become an important model for integrative physiological research. Zebrafish inhabit a hypo-osmotic environment; to maintain ionic and acid-base homeostasis, they must actively take up ions and secrete acid to the water. The gills in the adult and the skin at larval stage are the primary sites of ionic regulation in zebrafish. The uptake of ions in zebrafish is mediated by specific ion transporting cells termed ionocytes. Similarly, in mammals, ion reabsorption and acid excretion occur in specific cell types in the terminal region of the renal tubules (distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct). Previous studies have suggested that functional regulation of several ion transporters/channels in the zebrafish ionocytes resembles that in the mammalian renal cells. Additionally, several mechanisms involved in regulating the epithelial ion transport during metabolic acidosis are found to be similar between zebrafish and mammals. In this article, we systemically review the similarities and differences in ionic regulation between zebrafish and mammals during metabolic acidosis. We summarize the available information on the regulation of epithelial ion transporters during acidosis, with a focus on epithelial Na?, Cl-and Ca2+transporters in zebrafish ionocytes and mammalian renal cells. We also discuss the neuroendocrine responses to acid exposure, and their potential role in ionic compensation. Finally, we identify several knowledge gaps that would benefit from further study."
"Metabolic reprogramming is an important issue in tumor biology. An unexpected inter- and intra-tumor metabolic heterogeneity has been strictly correlated to tumor outcome. Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Protein 1 (TRAP1) is a molecular chaperone involved in the regulation of energetic metabolism in cancer cells. This protein is highly expressed in several cancers, such as glioblastoma, colon, breast, prostate and lung cancers and is often associated with drug resistance. However, TRAP1 is also downregulated in specific tumors, such as ovarian, bladder and renal cancers, where its lower expression is correlated with the worst prognoses and chemoresistance. TRAP1 is the only mitochondrial member of the Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) family that directly interacts with respiratory complexes, contributing to their stability and activity but it is still unclear if such interactions lead to reduced or increased respiratory capacity. The role of TRAP1 is to enhance or suppress oxidative phosphorylation; the effects of such regulation on tumor development and progression are controversial. These observations encourage the study of the mechanisms responsible for the dualist role of TRAP1 as an oncogene or oncosuppressor in specific tumor types. In this review, TRAP1 puzzling functions were recapitulated with a special focus on the correlation between metabolic reprogramming and tumor outcome. We wanted to investigate whether metabolism-targeting drugs can efficiently interfere with tumor progression and whether they might be combined with chemotherapeutics or molecular-targeted agents to counteract drug resistance and reduce therapeutic failure."
"Kocher, MH, Oba, Y, Kimura, IF, Stickley, CD, Morgan, CF, and Hetzler, RK. Allometric grip strength norms for American children. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2018-To develop normative data from a large cohort of American school children (ages 6-18) for unscaled and allometrically scaled handgrip strength data that are uninfluenced by body size (body mass [BM] and stature [Ht]). Data (age, handgrip strength, BM, and Ht) were collected from the 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey databases, resulting in 4,665 cases (2,384 boys and 2,281 girls). Multiple log-linear regressions were used to determine allometric exponents for BM and Ht separately for each age and sex to satisfy the common exponent and group difference principles described by Vanderburgh. Appropriateness of the allometric model was assessed through regression diagnostics, including normality and homoscedasticity of residuals. Allometrically scaled, ratio-scaled, and unscaled grip strength were then correlated with BM and Ht to examine the effectiveness of the procedure in controlling for body size. The data did not allow for development of a common exponent across age and sex that did not violate the common exponent and group difference principles. Correlations between allometrically scaled handgrip strength with BM and Ht were not significant (p ? 0.479) and approached zero, unlike correlations of unscaled handgrip strength with BM and Ht (p < 0.001 for all), indicating that allometric scaling was successful in removing the influence of body size. Allometric scaling handgrip strength by age and sex effectively controls for body size (Ht and BM) and perhaps maturation (Ht). The allometric exponents and normative values developed can be used to compare handgrip strength within age and sex while controlling for body size."
"Cross-reacting material 197 (CRM197) is a mutant form of the diphtheria toxin. Recent studies have found that CRM197 exerts an experimental antitumor effect on several types of tumors. This study applied a novel treatment of adenovirus-mediated CRM197 (AdCRM197) to human ovarian cancer cells. Interestingly, it was found that A2780 cells were sensitive to AdCRM197, but SKOV3 cells were resistant to it. Since SKOV3 cells are p53 deletion cells, while A2780 cells are p53 wild-type cells, it was postulated that p53 might play a key role in AdCRM197-induced apoptosis. This presumption was demonstrated by means of knockdown of p53 of the A2780 cells through lentivirus-mediated RNA interference. This knockdown resulted in the A2780 cells becoming resistant to AdCRM197. To verify this presumption further, the wild-type p53 gene in the SKOV3 cells was replaced with adenovirus-mediated p53 (Adp53). As expected, AdCRM197 plus Adp53 resulted in apoptosis of the SKOV3 cells. The combined treatment of AdCRM197 plus Adp53 also showed a good antitumor effect in the in vivo experiment on nude mice with xenograft tumors. Taking these results together, it is concluded that AdCRM197 induces apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cells via the p53 pathway. Moreover, it was found that Adp53 can reverse the resistance of p53-deletion human ovarian cancer cells to AdCRM197. The combination of AdCRM197 and Adp53 may be a potentially effective method for overcoming the resistance of p53-deficient human ovarian cancer to AdCRM197."
"The purpose of this study was to investigate the normal lingual frenulum anatomy in newborns and to evaluate tip-frenulum distance as an objective diagnostic tool for identifying newborns at risk for anterior and posterior tongue tie and breastfeeding difficulty.The distance from the tongue tip to the insertion of the lingual frenulum was measured in a group of 100 healthy newborns to establish normative data. The presence of a visible or palpable cord was noted. Inter-rater reliability was assessed. Breastfeeding surveys including a maternal pain scale and Infant Breastfeeding Assessment Tool (IBFAT) were administered on days of life 2 and 14 to determine whether these findings predict breastfeeding difficulty.Mean tip-frenulum length was 9.07?mm. Intraclass correlation coefficient between observers for tip-frenulum length was 0.82. A visible cord was identified in 21 subjects (21%). A palpable cord was identified in 59 subjects (59%). Unweighted ? coefficients for inter-rater reliability of visible and palpable cords were 0.91 and 0.47, respectively. Visible cord and shorter tip-frenulum distance were independently predictive of higher maternal pain scores. A positive correlation was identified between tip-frenulum length and IBFAT scores for mothers with two or more previous breastfed children.Tongue tip-frenulum length correlated with maternal nipple pain, and was useful as an objective tool for identifying newborns at risk for ankyloglossia. Maternal breastfeeding experience appears to be an important factor in the link between tongue anatomy and breastfeeding difficulty. The presence of a palpable cord was variable across examiners, and should be interpreted with caution when evaluating newborns for posterior tongue tie."
"The ubiquity of next-generation sequencing has transformed the size and nature of many databases, pushing the boundaries of current indexing and searching methods. One particular example is a database of 2652 human RNA-seq experiments uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Recently, Solomon and Kingsford proposed the Sequence Bloom Tree data structure and demonstrated how it can be used to accurately identify SRA samples that have a transcript of interest potentially expressed. In this article, we propose an improvement called the AllSome Sequence Bloom Tree. Results show that our new data structure significantly improves performance, reducing the tree construction time by 52.7% and query time by 39%-85%, with a price of upto 3?×?memory consumption during queries. Notably, it can query a batch of 198,074 queries in <8 hours (compared with around 2 days previously) and a whole set of k-mers from a sequencing experiment (about 27 million k-mers) in <11 minutes."
"A series of pyridine(diimine)iron tetrazene compounds, (                        i

PrPDI = 2,6-(ArN = CMe)2C5H3N; Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H3] has been prepared either by the addition of 2 equiv of an organic azide, RN3, to the corresponding iron bis(dinitrogen) compound, (                        i
PrPDI)Fe(N2)2or by the addition of azide to the iron imide derivatives, (                        i
PrPDI)FeNR. The electronic structures of these compounds were determined using a combination of metrical parameters from X-ray diffraction, solution and solid-state magnetic measurements, zero-field57Fe Mössbauer and1H NMR spectroscopies, and density functional theory calculations. The overall electronic structure of the iron tetrazene compounds is sensitive to the nature of the tetrazene nitrogen substituent with three distinct classes of compounds identified: (i) overall diamagnetic ( S = 0) compounds arising from intermediate-spin iron(II) centers ( SFe= 1) engaged in antiferromagnetic coupling with both pyridine(diimine) and tetrazene radical anions ( SPDI= -1/2and Stetrazene= -1/2; R = 2-adamantyl, cyclooctyl, benzyl); (ii) overall S = 1 compounds best described as intermediate-spin iron(III) ( SFe=3/2) derivatives engaged in antiferromagnetic coupling with a pyridine(diimine) radical anion ( SPDI= -1/2; R = 3,5-Me2C6H3, 4-MeC6H4); (iii) overall S = 2 compounds best described as high-spin iron(III) centers ( SFe=5/2) engaged in antiferromagnetic coupling to a pyridine(diimine) radical anion ( SPDI= -1/2; R = 1-adamantyl). For both the intermediate- and high-spin ferric cases, the tetrazene ligand adopts the closed-shell, dianionic form, [N4R2]2-. For the case where R = SiMe3, spin-crossover behavior is observed, arising from a spin-state change from intermediate- to high-spin iron(III)."
"A modular and hierarchical DNA assembly platform for synthetic biology based on Golden Gate (Type IIS restriction enzyme) cloning is described. This enabling technology, termed MIDAS (for Modular Idempotent DNA Assembly System), can be used to precisely assemble multiple DNA fragments in a single reaction using a standardized assembly design. It can be used to build genes from libraries of sequence-verified, reusable parts and to assemble multiple genes in a single vector, with full user control over gene order and orientation, as well as control of the direction of growth (polarity) of the multigene assembly, a feature that allows genes to be nested between other genes or genetic elements. We describe the detailed design and use of MIDAS, and its exemplification by the reconstruction, in the filamentous fungus Penicillium paxilli, of the metabolic pathway for production of paspaline and paxilline, key intermediates in the biosynthesis of a range of indole diterpenes - a class of secondary metabolites produced by several species of filamentous fungi. MIDAS was used to efficiently assemble a 25.2 kb plasmid from 21 different modules (seven genes, each composed of three basic parts). By using a parts library-based system for construction of complex assemblies, and a unique set of vectors, MIDAS can provide a flexible route to assembling tailored combinations of genes and other genetic elements, thereby supporting synthetic biology applications in a wide range of expression hosts."
"John Cunningham virus (JCV), the etiological agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), is the first human polyomavirus described. After asymptomatic primary infection which occurs in childhood, the virus spreads by the hematogenous route from the primary site of infection to secondary sites including kidneys, lymphoid tissues, peripheral blood leukocytes, and brain to establish latent infection. During immunosuppression the virus undergoes molecular rearrangements that allow it to replicate in glial tissues causing PML. PML occurs in people with underlying immunodeficiency or in individuals being treated with potent immunomodulatory therapies. Although the hypothesis that immune deficiency is a predisposing factor for PML, there are many unsolved issues including the pathogenic mechanisms related to the interaction of JCV infection/reactivation with the host. This is due to the difficulty of propagating the virus in human cell cultures and the absence of an animal model. This review updates current understanding in the context of JCV and human disease."
"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), coupled with reverse transcription (RT), has become a popular technique for detection of viral RNA due to several desirable characteristics for use in point-of-care or low-resource settings. The large number of primers in LAMP (six per target) leads to an increased likelihood of primer dimer interactions, and the inner primers in particular are prone to formation of stable hairpin structures due to their length (typically 40-45 bases). Although primer dimers and hairpin structures are known features to avoid in nucleic acid amplification techniques, there is little quantitative information in literature regarding the impact of these structures on LAMP or RT-LAMP assays. In this study, we examine the impact of primer dimers and hairpins on previously published primer sets for dengue virus and yellow fever virus. We demonstrate that minor changes to the primers to eliminate amplifiable primer dimers and hairpins improves the performance of the assays when monitored in real time with intercalating dyes, and when monitoring a fluorescent endpoint using the QUASR technique. We also discuss the thermodynamic implications of these minor changes on the overall stability of amplifiable secondary structures, and we present a single thermodynamic parameter that can be correlated to the probability of non-specific amplification associated with LAMP primers."
"The formation of condensed (compacted) protein phases is associated with a wide range of human disorders, such as eye cataracts, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, sickle cell anaemia and Alzheimer's disease. However, condensed protein phases have their uses: as crystals, they are harnessed by structural biologists to elucidate protein structures, or are used as delivery vehicles for pharmaceutical applications. The physiochemical properties of crystals can vary substantially between different forms or structures ('polymorphs') of the same macromolecule, and dictate their usability in a scientific or industrial context. To gain control over an emerging polymorph, one needs a molecular-level understanding of the pathways that lead to the various macroscopic states and of the mechanisms that govern pathway selection. However, it is still not clear how the embryonic seeds of a macromolecular phase are formed, or how these nuclei affect polymorph selection. Here we use time-resolved cryo-transmission electron microscopy to image the nucleation of crystals of the protein glucose isomerase, and to uncover at molecular resolution the nucleation pathways that lead to two crystalline states and one gelled state. We show that polymorph selection takes place at the earliest stages of structure formation and is based on specific building blocks for each space group. Moreover, we demonstrate control over the system by selectively forming desired polymorphs through site-directed mutagenesis, specifically tuning intermolecular bonding or gel seeding. Our results differ from the present picture of protein nucleation, in that we do not identify a metastable dense liquid as the precursor to the crystalline state. Rather, we observe nucleation events that are driven by oriented attachments between subcritical clusters that already exhibit a degree of crystallinity. These insights suggest ways of controlling macromolecular phase transitions, aiding the development of protein-based drug-delivery systems and macromolecular crystallography."
"PurposeTo describe our experience with a large cohort (411 patients from 288 families) of various forms of skeletal dysplasia who were molecularly characterized.MethodsDetailed phenotyping and next-generation sequencing (panel and exome).ResultsOur analysis revealed 224 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (54 (24%) of which are novel) in 123 genes with established or tentative links to skeletal dysplasia. In addition, we propose 5 genes as candidate disease genes with suggestive biological links (WNT3A, SUCO, RIN1, DIP2C, and PAN2). Phenotypically, we note that our cohort spans 36 established phenotypic categories by the International Skeletal Dysplasia Nosology, as well as 18 novel skeletal dysplasia phenotypes that could not be classified under these categories, e.g., the novel C3orf17-related skeletal dysplasia. We also describe novel phenotypic aspects of well-known disease genes, e.g., PGAP3-related Toriello-Carey syndrome-like phenotype. We note a strong founder effect for many genes in our cohort, which allowed us to calculate a minimum disease burden for the autosomal recessive forms of skeletal dysplasia in our population (7.16E-04), which is much higher than the global average.ConclusionBy expanding the phenotypic, allelic, and locus heterogeneity of skeletal dysplasia in humans, we hope our study will improve the diagnostic rate of patients with these conditions.GENETICS in MEDICINE advance online publication, 5 April 2018; doi:10.1038/gim.2018.50."
"Postinfection HIV viral control and immune correlates analysis of the RV144 vaccine trial indicate a potentially critical role for Fc receptor-mediated antibody functions. However, the influence of functional antibodies in clade C infection is largely unknown.Plasma samples from 361 chronic subtype C-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naïve participants were tested for their HIV-specific isotype and subclass distributions, along with their Fc receptor-mediated functional potential.Total IgG, IgG subclasses and IgA binding to p24 clade B/C and gp120 consensus C proteins were assayed by multiplex. Antibody-dependent uptake of antigen-coated beads and Fc receptor-mediated natural killer cell degranulation were evaluated as surrogates for antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), respectively.p24 IgG1 was the only subclass associated with viral control (P?=?0.01), with higher p24-specific ADCP and ADCC responses detected in individuals with high p24 IgG1. Although p24 IgG1 levels were enriched in patients with elevated Gag-specific T-cell responses, these levels remained an independent predictor of low-viral loads (P?=?0.04) and high CD4 counts (P?=?0.004) after adjusting for Gag-specific T-cell responses and for protective HLA class I alleles.p24 IgG1 levels independently predict viral control in HIV-1 clade C infection. Whether these responses contribute to direct antiviral control via the recruited killing of infected cells via the innate immune system or simply mark a qualitatively superior immune response to HIV, is uncertain, but highlights the role of p24-specific antibodies in control of clade C HIV-1 infection."
"HPV have been identified as high-risk and low-risk, depending on their association with the development of cancer. HPV infections can be facilitated by co-infection with HIV. Here, we investigated HPV prevalence and genotypes and the risk factors affecting HPV/HIV co-infection. Forty HIV-positive patients had 80 cervical swab samples collected in 2 consecutive years. Polymerase chain reaction and DNA direct sequencing were used to perform HPV genotyping. Statistical analyses were performed regarding risk factors for HPV/HIV co-infection and the occurrence of cervical lesions. HPV DNA was detected in 59 samples (73.75%), and high-risk HPVs were predominant (59.3%). The most prevalent type was HPV56 (17%), followed by HPV16 (15.3%). Patient age did not affect the risk of cervical cancer (P?=?.84) or HPV prevalence in different years (P?=?.25/P?=?.63). CD4 count also did not affect the risk for cervical lesions in the tested samples (P?=?.15/P?=?.28). Although the HIV viral load was not correlated with an increase in cervical lesion detection in the first group of analyzed samples (P?=?.12), it did affect cervical cancer risk in the group of samples analyzed in the following year (P?=?.045). HIV-infected patients presented a high prevalence of HPV co-infection, and HPV16 and HPV56 were the most prevalent genotypes. Considering this, it is possible that immunodeficiency can contribute to increased susceptibility to HPV56 infection in HIV-infected patients. The association between HIV viral load and the lesions also confirmed the importance of monitoring HIV/HPV co-infected patients with high HIV viral loads."
"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a prevalent form of heart failure, is frequently accompanied by the metabolic syndrome and kidney disease. Because current treatment options of HFpEF are limited, evaluation of therapies in experimental models of HFpEF with the metabolic syndrome and kidney disease is needed. In this study, we evaluated the effects of captopril, furosemide, and their combination in aged, obese ZSF1 rats, an animal model of HFpEF with the metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease as comorbidities. Captopril (100 mg/kg), furosemide (50 mg/kg), or their combination was administered orally to obese ZSF1 rats aged 20 to 44 weeks. Untreated ZSF1 rats served as controls. After 24 weeks of treatment, captopril significantly lowered systemic blood pressure and attenuated HFpEF as evidenced by significantly reduced left ventricular end diastolic pressures (10.5 ± 1.4 vs. 4.9 ± 1.3 mm Hg in Control vs. Captopril, respectively) and significantly lower left ventricular relaxation time constants (28.1 ± 2.9 vs. 18.3 ± 3.1 ms in Control vs. Captopril, respectively). The captopril-induced improvement in left ventricular function was associated with reduced cardiac hypertrophy, ischemia, necrosis, and vasculitis. Captopril also increased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, reduced renal vascular resistance and proteinuria, and improved renal histology (ie, reduced renal hypertrophy, glomerulosclerosis, and tubular atrophy/dilation). Furosemide alone provided little benefit; moreover, furosemide did not augment the therapeutic benefits of captopril. This study suggests that chronic administration of captopril, but not furosemide, could be beneficial in patients with HFpEF, particularly in those with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemias."
"Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics with parity-time symmetry is presently gaining great interest, especially within the fields of photonics and optics. Here we give a brief overview of two-dimensional semiconductor nanodevices using the example of a quantum with in- and output leads, which are mimicked by imaginary potentials for gain and loss, and how wave functions, particle flow, coalescence of levels and associated breaking of parity-time symmetry may be analyzed within such a framework. Special attention is given to the presence of exceptional points and symmetry breaking. A new concept of exceptional lines are introduced. Related features for musical string instruments and ""wolf-notes"" are outlined briefly with suggestions for further experiments."
"Single-cell analysis is pivotal to deciphering complex phenomena like heterogeneity, bistability, and asynchronous oscillations, where a population ensemble cannot represent individual behaviors. Bulk cell-free systems, despite having unique advantages of manipulation and characterization of biochemical networks, lack the essential single-cell information to understand a class of out-of-steady-state dynamics including cell cycles. Here, by encapsulatingXenopusegg extracts in water-in-oil microemulsions, we developed artificial cells that are adjustable in sizes and periods, sustain mitotic oscillations for over 30 cycles, and function in forms from the simplest cytoplasmic-only to the more complicated ones involving nuclear dynamics, mimicking real cells. Such innate flexibility and robustness make it key to studying clock properties like tunability and stochasticity. Our results also highlight energy as an important regulator of cell cycles. We demonstrate a simple, powerful, and likely generalizable strategy of integrating strengths of single-cell approaches into conventionalin vitrosystems to study complex clock functions."
"Patients with Gorham-Stout disease (GSD) have lymphatic vessels in their bones and their bones gradually disappear. Here we report that mice that overexpress VEGF-C in bone exhibit a phenotype that resembles GSD. To drive VEGF-C expression in bone, we generatedOsx-tTA;TetO-Vegfcdouble-transgenic mice. In contrast toOsx-tTAmice,Osx-tTA;TetO-Vegfcmice developed lymphatics in their bones. We found that inhibition of VEGFR3, but not VEGFR2, prevented the formation of bone lymphatics inOsx-tTA;TetO-Vegfcmice. Radiological and histological analysis revealed that bones fromOsx-tTA;TetO-Vegfcmice were more porous and had more osteoclasts than bones fromOsx-tTAmice. Importantly, we found that bone loss inOsx-tTA;TetO-Vegfcmice could be attenuated by an osteoclast inhibitor. We also discovered that the mutant phenotype ofOsx-tTA;TetO-Vegfcmice could be reversed by inhibiting the expression of VEGF-C. Taken together, our results indicate that expression of VEGF-C in bone is sufficient to induce the pathologic hallmarks of GSD in mice."
"Cells adapt to familiar changes in their environment by activating predefined regulatory programs that establish adaptive gene expression states. These hard-wired pathways, however, may be inadequate for adaptation to environments never encountered before. Here, we reveal evidence for an alternative mode of gene regulation that enables adaptation to adverse conditions without relying on external sensory information or genetically predeterminedcis-regulation. Instead, individual genes achieve optimal expression levels through a stochastic search for improved fitness. By focusing on improving the overall health of the cell, the proposed stochastic tuning mechanism discovers global gene expression states that are fundamentally new and yet optimized for novel environments. We provide experimental evidence for stochastic tuning in the adaptation ofSaccharomycescerevisiaeto laboratory-engineered environments that are foreign to its native gene-regulatory network. Stochastic tuning operates locally at individual gene promoters, and its efficacy is modulated by perturbations to chromatin modification machinery."
"We studied adaptive evolution of gene expression using long-term experimental evolution ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaein ammonium-limited chemostats. We found repeated selection for non-synonymous variation in the DNA binding domain of the transcriptional activator, GAT1, which functions with the repressor, DAL80 in an incoherent type-1 feedforward loop (I1-FFL) to control expression of the high affinity ammonium transporter gene, MEP2. Missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of GAT1 reduce its binding to the GATAA consensus sequence. However, we show experimentally, and using mathematical modeling, that decreases in GAT1 binding result in increased expression of MEP2 as a consequence of properties of I1-FFLs. Our results show that I1-FFLs, one of the most commonly occurring network motifs in transcriptional networks, can facilitate adaptive tuning of gene expression through modulation of transcription factor binding affinities. Our findings highlight the importance of gene regulatory architectures in the evolution of gene expression."
"Angiogenesis is coordinated by VEGF and Notch signaling. DLL4-induced Notch signaling inhibits tip cell formation and vessel branching. To ensure proper Notch signaling, receptors and ligands are clustered at adherens junctions. However, little is known about factors that control Notch activity by influencing the cellular localization of Notch ligands. Here we show that the multiple PDZ domain protein (MPDZ) enhances Notch signaling activity. MPDZ physically interacts with the intracellular carboxyterminus of DLL1 and DLL4 and enables their interaction with the adherens junction protein Nectin-2. Inactivation of the MPDZ gene leads to impaired Notch signaling activity and increased blood vessel sprouting in cellular models and the embryonic mouse hindbrain. Tumor angiogenesis was enhanced upon endothelial-specific inactivation of MPDZ leading to an excessively branched and poorly functional vessel network resulting in tumor hypoxia. As such, we identified MPDZ as a novel modulator of Notch signaling by controlling ligand recruitment to adherens junctions."
"Evaluating protein localization changes on a systematic level is a powerful tool for understanding how cells respond to environmental, chemical, or genetic perturbations. To date, work in understanding these proteomic responses through high-throughput imaging has catalogued localization changes independently for each perturbation. To distinguish changes that are targeted responses to the specific perturbation and more generalized programs, we developed a scalable approach to visualize the localization behavior of proteins across multiple experiments as a quantitative pattern. By applying this approach to 24 experimental screens consisting of nearly 400,000 images, we differentiate specific responses from more generalized ones, discover nuance in the localization behavior of stress-responsive proteins, and form hypotheses by clustering proteins with similar patterns. While previous approaches aim to capture all localization changes for a single screen as accurately as possible, our work aims to integrate large amounts of imaging data to find unexpected new cell biology."
"Objective To investigate the neuroprotective action of astragaloside ? (AS-?) on spatial learning and memory impairment induced by amyloid-beta 1-42 (A?1-42) in rats and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods Adult-male Sprague-Dawley rats (230-250 g) were divided into six groups randomly: control, A?1-42, AS-?, A?1-42 plus 5 mg/kg·d AS-?, A?1-42 plus 25 mg/kg·d AS-?, and A?1-42 plus 50 mg/kg·d AS-? groups. A?1-42 were delivered by intracerebroventricular injection under the guidance of a brain stereotaxic apparatus. The Morris water maze test (hidden platform test, probe trials, visible platform test) was performed one week after A?1-42 injection to obtain the ability of rat spatial learning and memory. AS-? (5, 25 and 50 mg/kg·d) was administrated intraperitoneally once per day from the 8th day after A?1-42 injection for 5 consecutive days. Average escape latencies, distances for searching for the platform under water and the percentage of total time elapsed and distance swam in the right quadrant after removing platform were determined by behavior software system. The vision and swim speeds of rats were also determined to exclude the effect of these factors on the parameters of learning and memory. After behavioral tests, the rats were sacrificed immediately by decapitation. Hippocampus were collected. The enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) and catalase (CAT) in the hippocampus obtained from different-treated rat brain were measured by following the manufacturer's instructions. The levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1?) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?) in tissue lysates were assayed with ELISA. Results The water maze test results indicated that chronic treatments with AS-? effectively protected the rats from A?1-42-induced spatial learning and memory impairment. Furthermore, the activities of SOD, GSH-px and CAT decreased by A?1-42 were also restored by AS-? treatment in the hippocampus of rats. In addition, AS-? significantly decreased the levels of IL-1? and TNF-? in the hippocampus of A?1-42-induced amnesia's rats. Conclusion Our findings suggest that AS-? might be a useful chemical in improving the spatial memory and relieving the oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer patients."
"Objective To screen the transient and stable cell lines with high production of Nectin-like 4 (Necl-4) protein. Methods First, cDNA sequences encoding the extracellular domain of Necls were cloned into the modified vector pAPtag at the N terminus of alkaline phosphatase (AP) for fusion expression. Next, 293ET cells stably expressed Necls-AP fusion protein and secreted it into the culture medium which were detected by the AP activity assay and Western blot analysis. Then, by adding N-glycosylation processing inhibitor kifunensine into the medium, complex glycan was inhibited to generate. The residual glycan of purified protein was removed by endoglycosidase H. Finally, AP protein was removed by using human rhinovirus protease and size exclusion chromatography. The concentration of purified Necl-4 protein was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Result The transient and stable cell lines with high production of Necl-4 protein were screened by the color reaction with the AP-tag in the recombinant vector. The soluble and active form of purified Necl-4 protein was obtained after deglycosylation of native N-glycan protein with an expression level of 4 mg/L culture and purity of 95%. Conclusions By using modified AP mammalian protein expression system, we can easily screen the high productive stable cell lines by using AP activity assay. By adding mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine into the medium and cutting purified protein by using endoglycosidase H, we can obtain deglycosylated Necl-4 protein in milligram quantities. Our method might throw a light on the expression and purification of glycoprotein for structural and functional studies."
"In enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), stx1 or stx2 genes encode Shiga toxin (Stx1 or Stx2, respectively) and are carried by prophages. The production and release of both stx phages and toxin occur upon initiation of the phage lytic cycle. Phages can further disseminate stx genes by infecting naïve bacteria in the intestine. Here, the effect of RNase E deficiency on these two virulence traits was investigated.Cultures of the EHEC strains TEA028-rne containing low versus normal RNase E levels or the parental strain (TEA028) were treated with mitomycin C (MMC) to induce the phage lytic cycle. Phages and Stx2 titres were quantified by the double-agar assay and the receptor ELISA technique, respectively.RNase E deficiency in MMC-treated cells significantly reduced the yield of infectious stx2 phages. Delayed cell lysis and the appearance of encapsidated phage DNA copies suggest a slow onset of the lytic cycle. However, these observations do not entirely explain the decrease of phage yields. stx1 phages were not detected under normal or deficient RNase E levels. After an initial delay, high levels of toxin were finally produced in MMC-treated cultures.RNase E scarcity reduces stx2 phage production but not toxin. Normal concentrations of RNase E are likely required for correct phage morphogenesis. Our future work will address the mechanism of RNase E action on phage morphogenesis."
"A novel actinobacterium, designated strain NEAU-SW11T, was isolated from soil collected from Binxian, Heilongjiang province, north China. The isolate was found to have chemical and morphological properties of the genus Streptacidiphilus, with the highest sequence similarities to Streptacidiphilus anmyonensis JCM 16223T(98.1?%), Streptacidiphilus jiangxiensis JCM 12277T(97.8?%), Streptacidiphilus melanogenes JCM 16224T(97.6?%) and Streptacidiphilus rugosus JCM 16225T(97.4?%) and it phylogenetically clustered with these four strains. The cell wall contained ll-diaminopimelic acid as the major diamino acid and the whole-cell hydrolysates were rhamnose, ribose, glucose and galactose. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and two unidentified phospholipids. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H8) and MK-9(H6). The major fatty acids were C16?:?0, anteiso-C17?:?0, C14?:?0 and C15?:?0. The DNA G+C?content was 71.0?mol%. However, DNA-DNA hybridization, physiological and biochemical data showed that strain NEAU-SW11Tcould be distinguished from its closest relatives. Therefore, strain NEAU-SW11Trepresents a novel species of the genus Streptacidiphilus, for which the name Streptacidiphilus monticola sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-SW11T(=CGMCC 4.7427T=DSM 105744T)."
"A taxonomic study was carried out on strain MT13131T, which was isolated from deep-sea sediment of the Indian Ocean during the screening of oil-degrading bacteria. The chain length range of n-alkanes (C8 to C32) oxidized by strain MT13131Twas determined in this study. The bacterium was Gram-negative, oxidase- and catalase-positive, single rod shaped, and motile by peritrichous flagella. Growth was observed at salinities of 1-12?% and at temperatures of 10-42?°C. The isolate was capable of Tween 20, 40 and 80 hydrolysis, but incapable of gelatin, cellulose or starch hydrolysis. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain MT13131Tbelonged to the genus Alcanivorax, with highest sequence similarity to Alcanivorax marinus R8-12T(96.92?%), other species of genus Alcanivorax shared 92.96-96.69?%?sequence similarity. The principal fatty acids were summed feature 3 (C16?:?1?6c/?7c), summed feature 8 (C18?:?1?7c/?6c), C16?:?0 and C12?:?0 3OH. The G+C?content of the chromosomal DNA was 64.2?mol%. Phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, three aminolipids and three phospholipids were present. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data showed that strain MT13131Trepresents a novel species within the genus Alcanivorax, for which the name Alcanivoraxmobilis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain MT13131T(=MCCC 1A11581T=KCTC 52985T)."
"To evaluate the metabolic responses in tumor cells exposed to ionizing radiation, oxygen consumption rate (OCR), cellular lipid peroxidation, cellular energy status (intracellular nucleotide pool and ATP production), and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), semiquinone (SQ), and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster levels were evaluated in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells at 12 and 24 h after X-irradiation. LC/MS/MS analysis showed that levels of 8-iso PGF2?and 5-iPF2?-VI, lipid peroxidation products of membrane arachidonic acids, were not altered significantly in X-irradiated cells, although mitochondrial ROS levels and OCR significantly increased in the cells at 24 h after irradiation. LC/UV analysis revealed that intracellular AMP, ADP, and ATP levels increased significantly after X-irradiation, but adenylate energy charge (adenylate energy charge (AEC) = [ATP + 0.5 × ADP]/[ATP + ADP + AMP]) remained unchanged after X-irradiation. In low-temperature electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of HeLa cells, the presence of mitochondrial SQ at g = 2.004 and Fe-S cluster at g = 1.941 was observed and X-irradiation enhanced the signal intensity of SQ but not of the Fe-S cluster. Furthermore, this radiation-induced increase in SQ signal intensity disappeared on treatment with rotenone, which inhibits electron transfer from Fe-S cluster to SQ in complex I. From these results, it was suggested that an increase in OCR and imbalance in SQ and Fe-S cluster levels, which play a critical role in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), occur after X-irradiation, resulting in an increase in ATP production and ROS leakage from the activated mitochondrial ETC."
"'BRCAness' is a term used to describe cancer cells that behave similarly to tumors with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. The BRCAness phenotype is associated with hypersensitivity to chemotherapy agents including PARP inhibitors, which are a promising class of recently-licensed anti-cancer treatments. This hypersensitivity arises because of a deficiency in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway for DNA double-strand break repair. To gain further insight into how genetic modifiers of HR contribute to the BRCAness phenotype, we created a new mouse model of BRCAness by generating mice that are deficient in BLM helicase and the Exo1 exonuclease, which are involved in the early stages of HR. We find that cells lacking BLM and Exo1 exhibit a BRCAness phenotype, with diminished HR, and hypersensitivity to PARP inhibitors. We further tested how 53BP1, an important regulator of HR, affects repair efficiency in our BRCAness model. We find that deletion of 53BP1 can relieve several of the repair deficiencies observed in cells lacking BLM and Exo1, just as it does in cells lacking BRCA1. These results substantiate the importance of BRCAness as a concept for classification of cancer cases, and further clarify the role of 53BP1 in regulation of DNA repair pathway choice in mammalian cells."
"Sterol-14?-demethylase (CYP51) is an ergosterol pathway enzyme crucial for the survival of infectious Leishmania parasite. Recent high-throughput metabolomics and whole genome sequencing study revealed amphotericin B resistance in Leishmania is indeed due to mutation in CYP51. The residue of mutation (asparagine 176) is conserved across the kinetoplastidae and not in yeast or humans, portraying its functional significance. In order to understand the possible cause for the resistance, knowledge of structural changes due to mutation is of high importance. To shed light on the structural changes of wild and mutant CYP51, we conducted comparative molecular dynamics simulation study. The active site, substrate biding cavity (SBC), substrate channel entrance (SCE), and cavity involving the mutated site (MC) were studied based on basic parameters and large concerted molecular motions derived from essential dynamics analyses of 100 ns simulation. Results indicated that mutant CYP51 is stable and less compact than the wild type. Correspondingly, the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the mutant was found to be increased, especially in active site and cavities not involving the mutation site. Free-energy landscape analysis disclosed mutant to have a rich conformational diversity than wild type, with various free-energy conformations of mutant having SASA greater than wild type with SCE open. More residues were found to interact with the mutant CYP51 upon docking of substrate to both the wild and mutant CYP51. These results indicate that, relative to wild type, the N176I mutation of CYP51 in Leishmania Mexicana could possibly favor increased substrate binding efficiency."
"In 1994, an endemic poultry pathogen, Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), was identified as the causative agent of a novel disease in house finches ( Haemorhous mexicanus). After an initial outbreak in Maryland, MG spread rapidly throughout eastern North American populations of house finches. Subsequently, MG spread slowly through the northern interior of North America and then into the Pacific Northwest, finally reaching California in 2006. Until 2009, there were no reports of MG in the southwestern United States east of California. In August 2011, after reports of house finches displaying conjunctivitis characteristic of MG infection in Arizona, we trapped house finches at bird feeders in central Arizona (Tempe) and southern Arizona (Tucson and Green Valley) to assay for MG infection. Upon capture, we noted whether birds exhibited conjunctivitis, and we collected choanal swabs to test for the presence of MG DNA using PCR. We detected MG in finches captured from Green Valley (in ?12% of birds captured), but not in finches from Tucson or Tempe. Based on resampling of house finches at these sites in July 2014, we suggest that central Arizona finches likely remain unexposed to MG. We also suggest that low urban connectivity between arid habitats of southern and central Arizona or a reduction in the prevalence of MG after its initial arrival in Arizona may be limiting the spread of MG from south to north in Arizona. In addition, the observed conjunctivitis-like signs in house finches that were negative for MG by PCR may be caused primarily by avian pox virus."
"A series of studies were undertaken to optimize the propagation of hemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV) in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. A total of 562 SPF chickens were orally inoculated with an Australian avirulent HEV isolate of turkey origin at 9, 14, 21, or 28 days of age with 5, 6, 7, or 8 log?10genomic copies (GC), while 102 chickens served as uninfected controls. No clinical signs were observed in infected chickens. There was an inoculum-dose-dependent increase in the relative spleen and liver weight ( P < 0.01). Relative spleen weight 7 days post-HEV inoculation was up to 85% higher in chickens that were inoculated with 6 to 7 GC compared with controls, with no further increase at higher doses. Relative liver weight increased up to 14% in chickens inoculated with 6 GC, with no further increase. Birds inoculated with a 7 GC dose had a higher frequency of HEV DNA-positive birds (77% to 86%) than birds inoculated with lower doses (33% to 59%; P < 0.01). The most efficient dose for live passage propagation was 7 GC inoculated in 9-to-14-day-old birds, yielding an infection rate of 81%. Livers and spleens from infected birds at all doses were processed to produce a putative vaccine with a final GC recovery in the vaccine material of 8.6 GC/bird. In summary, HEV of turkey origin can be readily propagated in SPF chickens, and conditions to maximize viral retrieval were established."
"Cold exposure activates the sympathetic nervous system. It is generally thought that this sympathetic activation induces heat production by stimulating lipolysis of cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) in brown adipocytes. However, this concept was not examined in vivo due to lack of appropriate animal models. Recently, we and others have demonstrated that LD lipolysis in brown adipocytes is not required for cold-induced nonshivering thermogenesis. Our studies uncovered an essential role of white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis in fueling thermogenesis during fasting. In addition, we showed that lipolysis deficiency in brown adipose tissue (BAT) induces WAT browning. This commentary further discusses the significance of our findings and how whole body may be heated up without BAT lipolysis."
"To estimate, from experimental data, the retreatment radiation 'tolerances' of the spinal cord at different times after initial treatment.A model was developed to show the relationship between the biological effective doses (BED) for two separate courses of treatment with the BED of each course being expressed as a percentage of the designated 'retreatment tolerance' BED value, denoted BED1and BED2. The primate data of Ang et al (2001) was used to determine the fitted parameters. However, based on rodent data, recovery was assumed to commence 70 days after the first course was complete, and with a non-linear relationship to the magnitude of the initial BED (BEDinit).The model, taking into account the above processes, provides estimates of the retreatment tolerance dose after different times. Extrapolations from the experimental data can provide conservative estimates for the clinic, with a lower acceptable myelopathy incidence. Care must be taken to convert the predicted BED2value into a formal BED value and then a practical dose fractionation schedule.Used with caution, the proposed model allows estimations of retreatment doses with elapsed times ranging from 70 days up to three years after the initial course of treatment."
"Stem cell biology offers promise for understanding the origins of mammary gland. However, the distribution of mammary stem cell (MaSC) activities at earlier embryonic stage has not been fully identified. As the markers for sorting adult MaSC, CD24, CD29 and CD49f have been applied to analyze fetal MaSCs. Here we explored mammary anlagen MaSCs by investigating CD24/CD49f expressions. According to the comparative analysis between adult mammary gland and fetal mammary anlagen, we found that fetal mouse mammary anlagen might possess high percentage of potential MaSCs. Then, the flow cytometric analysis revealed two distinct mammary anlagen populations: Lin-CD24med and Lin-CD24high. The following sphere-forming and mammary repopulating assays confirmed that the stem activity of E14.5 mouse mammary anlagen was restricted to Lin-CD24med cell population. Furthermore, CD24med mammary anlagen cells were separated into Lin-CD24medCD49f+ and Lin-CD24medCD49f- populations and identified, respectively. The results proved that mammary anlagen Lin-CD24medCD49f+ cell population possess more stem cell activities than Lin-CD24medCD49f- cell population did. However, the limited numbers of stem cells and large numbers of stromal cells were identified in mammary anlagen Lin-CD24med cell population."
"A triflate-triggered intermolecular cyclization of carbodiimides to provide 2-amino-4-imino-quinazolines, which could be easily transformed to 2-aminoquinazolinones and 2,4-diaminoquinazolines in high yield, has been reported. A variety of functional groups are tolerated in the 2-amino-4-iminoquinazoline scaffolds."
"Two classes of widely studied luminescent metal complexes are octahedral d6(i.e., Ir3+) and square planar d8(i.e., Pt2+) polypyridyl complexes, which have distinctly different photophysics and photoreactivity. In this study we report a series of d6-d8IrIII-PtIIhybrid complexes arising from coordination of metalloligands IrL2(benzene-1-thioether-2-thiolate) or Ir(L)2(benzene-1,2-dithiolate) anion [L = 2-phenylpyridine (ppy), 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dfppy), or 1-phenylisoquinoline (piq)] to Pt(terpy)2+(terpy = 2,2':6',2?-terpyridine). X-ray crystal structures of the Ir-Pt complexes show the IrL2and Pt(terpy) chromophores are cofacially oriented with interplanar distances of 3.268-3.442 Å. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital are localized in the IrL2and the Pt(terpy), respectively. All the complexes display a low-energy absorption band (?max= 460-534 nm, ?max= (0.75-2.13) × 103M-1cm-1), which is attributed to interchromophore-charge-transfer (ICCT) transition, according to time-dependent DFT calculations. The3ICCT excited state is emissive, giving long-lived phosphorescence that reaches as low as near-infrared (?max= 668-710 nm, ? = 0.17-0.79 ?s)."
"Cytochalasin H (CyH) has been shown to exhibit promising anticancer activities against various types of cancers; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In a previous study, we isolated CyH from the mangrove?derived endophytic fungus Phomopsis sp. in Zhanjiang, China. In the present study, we further explored the effect of CyH on apoptosis and migration in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549. Cell Counting kit?8 (CCK?8) assay was used to observe the effects of CyH on the growth of A549 cells. The cell cycle and apoptosis were determined using flow cytometry. The effect of CyH on cell migration was observed by scratch wound healing and chamber migration assays. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of apoptosis? and metastasis?associated proteins. Our results showed that CyH exhibited cytotoxicity to A549 cells. The treatment of CyH arrested A549 cells at the G2/M phase. Furthermore, sub?G1 peaks and fragmented DNA ladders were observed, and the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was also decreased in CyH?treated A549 cells. CyH significantly increased Bax, P53, and cleaved caspase?3 (17 kDa) protein expression and decreased Bcl?xL, Bcl?2, and full?length caspase?3 (35 kDa) protein expression, resulting in an increased ratio of the pro?apoptosis/anti?apoptosis proteins Bax/Bcl?2. Additionally, CyH treatment inhibited the migration ability of A549 cells in a dose?dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that CyH may be a potential chemopreventive drug for the treatment of lung cancer."
"Helium ion microscopy (HIM) scans samples with a fine ion beam exploiting the very short de Broglie wavelength of helium ions. Because the radiation induces only a small sample region to emit secondary electrons (SEs), very high resolution is expected. In order to explore the applications of SE-HIM in biology, COS7 kidney fibroblast cells and C2C12 myoblast cells cultured on a silicon (Si) nitride (SiN)/Si bilayer were dried and directly observed in high vacuum, without coating or staining. High contrast, high depth-of-field images were obtained revealing the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoskeleton and putative mitochondria above a bright background from the support. Gold-tagged antibodies were employed to aid organelle identification. Signals from the gold tags were most clearly distinguishable by secondary electron (SE)-HIM when cells were grown on thin SiN film, and the minimum gap measured between gold particles showed the resolution to be 2 nm. Wheat germ agglutinin-gold labeling revealed clusters of gold particles ~50-200 nm in diameter on COS7 cells, which might represent assemblies of glycosylated proteins, suggesting the formation of membrane raft structures that include membrane proteins. SE-HIM also delivered high contrast images of unstained, uncoated, thin sections of Epon?embedded mouse kidney tissues mounted on a SiN/Si bilayer, revealing the details of sub-tissues and cell organelles. A charge-coupled mechanism explaining the observed SE-HIM contrast is proposed. Ionoluminescence-HIM was also performed targeting zinc oxide particles on cells. In conclusion, the high depth-of-field, high-resolution imaging achieved using HIM may have applications in various fields, including soft materials."
"High concentrations of glutamate may mediate neuronal cell apoptosis by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Peroxiredoxin V (Prx V), a member of the Prx family, serves crucial roles in protecting cells from oxidative stress. The present study investigated the regulatory effect of Prx V on glutamate?induced effects on viability and apoptosis in HT22 cells. Western blotting was used for protein expression analysis and Annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometry for determination of apoptosis. The results demonstrated that glutamate may ROS?dependently increase HT22 cell apoptosis and upregulate Prx V protein levels. Furthermore, knockdown of Prx V protein expression with a lentivirus significantly enhanced HT22 cell apoptosis mediated by glutamate, which was reversed by inhibition of ROS with N?acetyl?L?cysteine. Inhibiting the extracellular signal?regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway with PD98059, a specific inhibitor for ERK phosphorylation, markedly decreased glutamate?induced HT22 cell apoptosis in Prx V knockdown cells, indicating the potential involvement of ERK signaling in glutamate?induced HT22 cell apoptosis. In addition, an increase in nuclear apoptosis?inducing factor was observed in Prx V knockdown HT22 cells following glutamate treatment, compared with mock cells, whereas no differences in B?cell lymphoma?2 and cleaved?caspase?3 protein expression levels were observed between mock and Prx V knockdown cells. The results of the present study indicated that Prx V may have potential as a therapeutic molecular target for glutamate?induced neuronal cell death and provide novel insight into the role of Prx V in oxidative?stress induced neuronal cell death."
"It has been demonstrated that ??arrestin2 is involved in the initiation and development of many types of cancers. However, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly understood. The present study investigated the role of ??arrestin2 in CRC using CRC patient tissues as well as the LoVo and HCT116 CRC cell lines. Briefly, significantly higher expression of ??arrestin2 was observed in CRC tissues compared with normal colon tissues. In addition, the downregulation of ??arrestin2 reduced 5?FU?induced apoptosis in the LoVo cells, while the overexpression of ??arrestin2 increased the apoptosis of HCT116 cells in vitro. Furthermore, the downregulation of ??arrestin2 reduced the expression of the pro?apoptotic proteins cleaved?caspase?3 and Bax, and increased the expression of the anti?apoptotic protein Bcl?2 after 5?FU treatment. In addition, the expression of p?p65 was increased after the ??arrestin2 downregulation and was decreased after the ??arrestin2 overexpression. However, ??arrestin2 downregulation had no effect on the proliferation, migration and invasion capacity of the LoVo cells. In conclusion, these results indicated that ??arrestin2 promoted 5?FU?induced CRC cell apoptosis via the NF??B pathway and may be used as a prognosis marker for CRC."
"Resveratrol (RES), a polyphenol compound with anti?proliferative properties, has been previously evaluated for its beneficial effects against a variety of tumour cells. The current study elucidated the means by which RES enhances the anti?proliferative effects of cisplatin (CIS) on MCF?7 cells, focusing on the inhibitory effects on DNA repair of double?strand breaks (DSBs). Chemoresistant MCF?7 cells (MCF?7R) were generated by continuous exposure to low concentrations of CIS (10 µM CIS?IC40) during 5 passages, with the IC50 value increasing ~3?fold. Using an MTT assay, we estimated the changes in IC50 for CIS in MCF?7, T47?D, MDA?MB?231 and MCF?7R cells in the presence of RES. The relative transcript level of Nbs?1, Mre?11 and Rad?50 genes was assessed using RT?qPCR analysis. Rad51 and H2AX [pSer139] protein expression was determined by western blot analysis. RES at 50 and 100 µM significantly enhanced the anti?proliferative effects of CIS in both MCF?7 and MCF?7R cells, decreasing the IC50 values for CIS to one?tenth and one?sixth, respectively. A total of 100 µM RES decreased the relative transcript levels of homologous recombination (HR) initiation complex components and the Rad51 protein level in MCF?7 and MCF?7R cells. After 48 h of CIS DNA damage, the levels of Rad51 protein increased, but this effect was inhibited by 100 µM RES. RES also maintained serine 139 phosphorylation of histone H2AX, suggesting that RES prevents the repair of DSBs. It was observed that RES exerts an antagonistic effect over CIS on the activation of Rad51 and sustained phosphorylation of H2AX. The results suggest that RES in combination with DNA damage?based therapy has potential as a strategy to overcome resistance and provide much safer and more effective treatment for breast cancer."
"There are currently limitations in stem cell therapy due to the low rate of homing and proliferation of cells following transplantation. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of Tenascin?C (TN?C) on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and its underlying mechanisms. BMSCs were obtained from C57BL/6 mice. The survival and proliferation of BMSCs was analyzed by Cell Counting Kit?8 assay, migration was evaluated using the Transwell method, and differentiation was assessed by immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence. In addition, the levels of proteins were detected by western blotting. High concentrations of TN?C promoted the migration of BMSCs. H2O2 at concentrations of 60?90 µmol/ml induced cell death in BMSCs, and thus, it was used to simulate oxidative stress in the microenvironment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). High concentrations of TN?C were able to protect BMSCs from cell death, and promoted the migration of BMSCs (P<0.05). However, TAK?242 [the inhibitor of Toll?like receptor 4, (TLR4)] reduced the promoting effect of TN?C (P<0.05). By contrast, TN?C had no effect on the proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs. TN?C reduced the phosphorylation levels of p38 mitogen?activated protein kinase (MAPK), and increased the phosphorylation levels of Ser473 protein kinase B (AKT) and ??catenin, all of which were inhibited by TAK?242 (P<0.05). In the simulated AMI microenvironment, TN?C promoted the migration of BMSCs via TLR4?mediated signaling pathways, including MAPK, AKT and Wnt."
"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has the synergistic effect of the combination of a single ingredient and a monomer, and systemic and local therapeutic effects in cancer treatment, through which TCM is able to enhance the curative effect and reduce the side effects. The present study analyzed the effect of TCM?1 (an anti?cancer TCM) on prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, and studied in detail the mechanism of cell death induced by TCM?1 in vitro and in vivo. From the present results, it was identified for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that TCM?1 arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase, decreased cell viability and increased nuclear rupture in a dose?dependent manner; these effects finally resulted in apoptosis in PCa cells. At the molecular level, the data demonstrated that TCM?1 competitively acted on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with EGF, and suppressed the auto?phosphorylation and activity of EGFR. Inhibition of EGFR further suppressed the downstream phosphatidylinositol 3?kinase (PI3K)/RAC?? serine/threonine?protein kinase (AKT) and RAF proto?oncogene serine/threonine?protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase signaling pathways and resulted in a decrease in the phosphorylated?forkhead box protein O1 (at Ser256, Thr24 and Ser319) expression level, and induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis by regulating the expression of apoptosis?and cell cycle?associated genes. In addition, TCM?1 markedly inhibited the PI3K/AKT/serine/threonine?protein kinase mTOR signaling pathway and induced cell autophagy by downregulating the phosphorylation of p70S6K and upregulating the levels of Beclin?1 and microtubule?associated protein light chain?3II. In vivo, the TCM?1?treated group exhibited a significant decrease in tumor volume compared with the negative control group in subcutaneous xenograft nude mice by inhibiting EGFR?associated signaling pathways. Therefore, the bio?functions of Chinese medicine TCM?1 in inducing PCa cell growth inhibition, autophagy and apoptosis suggested that TCM?1 may have clinical potential for the treatment of patients with PCa."
"An intratumoral hypoxic microenvironment is frequently observed in solid tumors, including breast cancer. Lutein, a plant-derived compound and non-vitamin A carotenoid, has been demonstrated to possess multiple protective properties including anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress and antitumor effects. The main objective of the present research was to elucidate the involvement of lutein in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under hypoxia, the activation of hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1), and the proliferation, invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. The human breast cancer cell lines MDA?MB?157 and MCF?7 were exposed to hypoxic conditions and various concentrations of lutein. An MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay was performed to examine cell proliferation, and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining was performed to analyze the apoptosis ratio. The levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1? (HIF?1?), NOTCH signaling molecules, HES1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated factors were examined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Wound healing and Transwell invasion assays were used to detect the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Intracellular ROS levels were examined using 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein-diacetate and flow cytometry. The results revealed that cell proliferation was inhibited by lutein in a dose-dependent manner, and the apoptosis ratio gradually increased with lutein treatment under hypoxia as evident from flow cytometry-based analysis. Exposure to lutein inhibited hypoxia-mediated activation of HIF?1?, NOTCH signaling and HES1 expression, and suppressed the hypoxia-induced expression of EMT-associated factors. Lutein markedly inhibited the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells under hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced production of ROS was also decreased by lutein. Furthermore, the ROS scavenger N?acetylcysteine also suppressed hypoxia inducible factor 1? and HES1 expression in breast cancer cells during hypoxia, but hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels were increased. Taken together, the results of the present study suggested that lutein may be a novel candidate for the chemoprevention of breast cancer. Furthermore, HES1 may be crucial in mediating the involvement of lutein in the suppression of hypoxia-driven ROS-induced breast cancer progression."
"High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) accounts for the highest number of deaths among patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HGSOC tumorigenesis are currently unclear. In the present study, a lentiviral expression system was employed to manipulate forkhead box D1 (FOXD1) expression in ovarian cancer cells. Immunohistochemical staining was used to examine the expression of FOXD1 in tissue samples. Clonogenic and MTT assays were employed to evaluate cell proliferation, and flow cytometry was applied for cell cycle analysis. Dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to determine the role of FOXD1 in regulating p21 expression. The results demonstrated that FOXD1 expression was downregulated in HGSOC, and high expression levels of FOXD1 were found to be a predictor of good prognosis. FOXD1 significantly inhibited the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells and induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in vitro. In addition, exogenous FOXD1 expression inhibited ovarian cancer cell growth in vivo. Furthermore, microRNA (miR)-30a-5p and miR-200a-5p were observed to be upregulated in HGSOC, and function as direct negative regulators of FOXD1 by targeting its 3'-untranslated region. The present study also revealed that FOXD1 promotes p21 expression in a p53-independent manner. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate a direct association between FOXD1 and p21 that may be mediated by miR-30a-5p and miR-200a-5p. The authors hypothesize that FOXD1 may serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target in HGSOC."
"15-Deoxy-?12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d?PGJ2) is a natural agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?) that displays anticancer activity. Various studies have indicated that the effects of 15d?PGJ2 are due to both PPAR?-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In the present study, we examined the effects of a biotinylated form of 15d?PGJ2 (b?15d?PGJ2) on hormone-dependent MCF?7 and triple?negative MDA?MB?231 breast cancer cell lines. b?15d?PGJ2 inhibited cell proliferation more efficiently than 15d?PGJ2 or the synthetic PPAR? agonist, efatutazone. b?15d?PGJ2 was also more potent than its non-biotinylated counterpart in inducing apoptosis. We then analyzed the mechanisms underlying this improved efficiency. It was found not to be the result of biotin receptor-mediated increased incorporation, since free biotin in the culture medium did not decrease the anti-proliferative activity of b?15d?PGJ2 in competition assays. Of note, b?15d?PGJ2 displayed an improved PPAR? agonist activity, as measured by transactivation experiments. Molecular docking analyses revealed a similar insertion of b?15d?PGJ2 and 15d?PGJ2 into the ligand binding domain of PPAR? via a covalent bond with Cys285. Finally, PPAR? silencing markedly decreased the cleavage of the apoptotic markers, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP?1) and caspase?7, that usually occurs following b?15d?PGJ2 treatment. Taken together, our data indicate that biotinylation enhances the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity of 15d?PGJ2, and that this effect is partly mediated via a PPAR?-dependent pathway. These results may aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for breast cancer treatment."
"Quercetin has been demonstrated to produce DNA damage in the presence of metal ions. In the present study, 7 natural and 5 semi?synthetic glycosylated flavonoids were utilized to investigate the cupric ion (Cu2+)?dependent DNA damage in vitro. The reaction mixture, containing single?stranded DNA, different concentrations of flavonoids and cupric ion in the buffer, was incubated at three different temperatures. DNA damage was then assessed by gel electrophoresis followed by densitometric analysis. The reaction mixture with quercetin at 4, 20 and 54?C induced DNA damage in a concentration? and temperature?dependent manner. Furthermore, only the reaction at 54?C resulted in DNA damage in flavonoids with glucosyl substitution of the hydroxyl group at the 3?position on the C ring in quercetin. By contrast, loss of the hydroxyl group at the 3?position on the C ring, or at the 3'? or 4'?position on the B ring of quercetin, did not portray DNA damage formation at the investigated experimental temperatures. In addition, the experimental results suggested that the hydroxyl group at the 3?position on the C ring produced the strongest capability to induce DNA damage in the presence of cupric ions. Furthermore, hydroxyl groups at the 3'? or 4'?position on the B ring were only able to induce DNA damage at higher temperatures, and were less efficient in comparison with the hydroxyl group at the 3?position on the C ring. Cupric ion chelating capacity was also assessed with spectroscopic analysis, and quercetin presented the largest chelating capacity among the tested flavonoids. Hydroxyl radical formation was assessed with a luminol reaction, and quercetin presented faster consumption of luminol. These results suggest that the 3?position hydroxyl group of the C ring is required to induce DNA damage at low temperatures. Furthermore, the results of the present study also indicated that the presence of cupric ions will decrease the activity of the glycosylated quercetins, in terms of their ability to induce DNA damage."
"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is the most pleiotropic cytokine of the interleukin?6 family, and is widely used to establish and maintain pluripotent stem cells, particularly mouse pluripotent stem cells. However, no reports have fully elucidated the application of LIF in marmoset induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) culture, particularly the underlying mechanisms. To demonstrate the feasibility of the application of LIF to marmoset iPSCs, the present study assessed these cells in the presence of LIF. Cell proliferation was measured using MTT assay, cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometric analysis of fluorescein isothiocyanate Annexin V staining and the differentially expressed genes were analysed using Digital Gene Expression (DGE) analysis. The altered expression of pluripotency?associated genes was confirmed by reverse transcription?quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Furthermore, following treatment with LY294002, cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay and protein levels were confirmed by western blot analysis. The results showed that LIF significantly promoted the number of proliferating cells, but had no effect on apoptosis. Digital Gene Expression analysis was used to examine the differentially expressed genes of marmoset iPSCs in the presence of LIF. The results showed that the pluripotency?associated transcription factor?encoding gene T?box 3 (Tbx?3) was activated by LIF. Notably, LIF increased the levels of phosphorylated (p?)AKT and Tbx?3 in the marmoset iPSCs. Furthermore, pretreatment with LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3?kinase (PI3K), significantly impaired the LIF?induced upregulation of p?AKT and Tbx?3 in the marmoset iPSCs, suggesting that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in this regulation. Taken together, the results suggested that LIF is effective in maintaining marmoset iPSCs in cultures, which is associated with the activation of Tbx?3 through regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway."
"Dysfunctional salivary gland (SG) is an unsolved clinical challenge, which is presented as xerostomia. Cell therapy is a promising treatment for restoring SG function. Salispheres are spheroid cellular organizations derived from SG stem cells. Benefitting from these cellular organizations, SG stem cells can be expanded to regenerate SG. During in vitro culture, the spontaneous reorganization of salispheres may change the features of residing SG stem cells. Therefore, it is imperative to explore ways to maintain the spheroid structure of salispheres during cell expansion in vitro. Herein, we explored biomaterial approaches using chitosan. Chitosan based biomaterials were fabricated in different forms to offer distinct interactive surfaces for cultured salispheres. The number and size of the salispheres increase in the chitosan-containing systems without increasing the incidence of spheroid cavitation. The effect of chitosan increases with high chitosan concentrations, which is optimum when chitosan is fabricated in a soluble form. The chitosan effect contributes to the regulation of the intercellular interactions and polarization within the spheroid structures. By retarding the process of salisphere cavitation, chitosan preserves the features of salivary gland progenitor cells in the cultured salispheres. The results suggest that the chitosan-containing system could effectively maintain the primitive structures and properties of salispheres during in vitro expansion, which demonstrates the potential application of salispheres for cell therapy of dysfunctional SG."
"Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based cardiac regenerative medicine requires the efficient generation, structural soundness and proper functioning of mature cardiomyocytes, derived from the patient's somatic cells. The most important functional property of cardiomyocytes is the ability to contract. Currently available methods routinely used to test and quantify cardiomyocyte function involve techniques that are labor-intensive, invasive, require sophisticated instruments or can adversely affect cell vitality. We recently developed optical flow imaging method analyses and quantified cardiomyocyte contractile kinetics from video microscopic recordings without compromising cell quality. Specifically, our automated particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis of phase-contrast video images captured at a high frame rate yields statistical measures characterizing the beating frequency, amplitude, average waveform and beat-to-beat variations. Thus, it can be a powerful assessment tool to monitor cardiomyocyte quality and maturity. Here we demonstrate the ability of our analysis to characterize the chronotropic responses of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to a panel of ion channel modulators and also to doxorubicin, a chemotherapy agent with known cardiotoxic side effects. We conclude that the PIV-derived beat patterns can identify the elongation or shortening of specific phases in the contractility cycle, and the obtained chronotropic responses are in accord with known clinical outcomes. Hence, this system can serve as a powerful tool to screen the new and currently available pharmacological compounds for cardiotoxic effects."
"The design and synthesis of coordination polymers (CPs) have attracted much interest due to the intriguing diversity of their architectures and topologies. The functional solid catena-poly[?2-aqua-triaqua{?4-5-[4-carboxyphenoxy)methyl]benzene-1,3-dicarboxylato}{?3-5-[4-carboxyphenoxy)methyl]benzene-1,3-dicarboxylato}dicobalt(II)], [Co2(C16H10O7)2(H2O)4]nor [Co2(HL)2(?2-H2O)(H2O)3]n, was synthesized successfully by self-assembly of CoIIions with 5-[(4-carboxyphenoxy)methyl]isophthalic acid (H3L). The title compound was obtained under hydrothermal conditions and exhibits a twofold interpenetrated three-dimensional skeleton with hms 3,5-conn topology according to the cluster representation for valence-bonded metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). It has been characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis and susceptibility measurements. The antiferromagnetic coupling between adjacent CoIIcentres occurs via superexchange through the ligands."
"Ablative hypofractionated radiation therapy (AHFRT) presents a therapeutic advantage compared with conventional fractionated radiation therapy (CFRT) for primary and oligometastatic cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the present study, we compared the immune alterations in response to AHFRT versus CFRT and examined the significance of immune regulations contributing to the efficacy of AHFRT.We established subcutaneous tumors using syngeneic lung cancer and melanoma cells in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice and treated them with AHFRT and CFRT under the same biologically equivalent dose.Compared with CFRT, AHFRT significantly inhibited tumor growth in immunocompetent, but not immunocompromised, mice. On the cellular level, AHFRT reduced the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into tumors and decreased the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on those cells, which unlashed the cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells. Through the downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), AHFRT inhibited VEGF/VEGF receptor signaling, which was essential for MDSC recruitment. When combined with anti-PD-L1 antibody, AHFRT presented with greater efficacy in controlling tumor growth and improving mouse survival. By altering immune regulation, AHFRT, but not CFRT, significantly delayed the growth of secondary tumors implanted outside the irradiation field.Targeting MDSC recruitment and enhancing antitumor immunity are crucial for the therapeutic efficacy of AHFRT. When combined with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, AHFRT was more potent for cancer treatment."
"To investigate how necroptosis (ie, programmed necrosis) is involved in killing of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after ablative hypofractionated radiation therapy (HFRT).Deoxyribonucleic acid damage, DNA repair, and the death form of NSCLC cells were assessed after radiation therapy. The overexpression and silencing of receptor-interacting protein kinases 3 (RIP3, a key protein involved activation of necroptosis)-stable NSCLC cell lines were successfully constructed. The form of cell death, the number and area of colonies, and the regulatory proteins of necroptosis were characterized after radiation therapy in vitro. Finally, NSCLC xenografts and patient specimens were used to examine involvement of necroptosis after ablative HFRT in vivo.Radiation therapy induced expected DNA damage and repair of NSCLC cell lines, but ablative HFRT at ?10 Gy per fraction preferentially stimulated necroptosis in NSCLC cells and xenografts with high RIP3 expression, as characterized by induction and activation of RIP3 and mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein and release of immune-activating chemokine high-mobility group box 1. In contrast, RNA interference of RIP3 attenuated ablative HFRT-induced necroptosis and activation of its regulatory proteins. Among central early-stage NSCLC patients receiving stereotactic body radiation therapy, high expression of RIP3 was associated with improved local control and progression-free survival (all P < .05).Ablative HFRT at ?10 Gy per fraction enhances killing of NSCLC with high RIP3 expression via preferential stimulation of necroptosis. RIP3 may serve as a useful biomarker to predict favorable response to stereotactic body radiation therapy."
"Deprotection of the 5' end appears to be a universal mechanism for triggering the degradation of mRNA in bacteria and eukaryotes. In Escherichia coli, for example, converting the 5' triphosphate of primary transcripts to a monophosphate accelerates cleavage at internal sites by the endonuclease RNase E. Previous studies have shown that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH catalyzes this transformation in vitro and generates monophosphorylated decay intermediates in vivo. Recently, we reported that purified E. coli RppH unexpectedly reacts faster with diphosphorylated than with triphosphorylated substrates. By using a novel assay, it was also determined that diphosphorylated mRNA decay intermediates are abundant in wild-type E. coli and that their fractional level increases to almost 100% for representative mRNAs in mutant cells lacking RppH. These findings indicate that the conversion of triphosphorylated to monophosphorylated RNA in E. coli is a stepwise process involving sequential phosphate removal and the transient formation of a diphosphorylated intermediate. The latter RNA phosphorylation state, which was previously unknown in bacteria, now appears to define the preferred biological substrates of E. coli RppH. The enzyme responsible for generating it remains to be identified."
"The investigations have shown that patients with diabetes have the elevated levels of glucose and oxLDL. These two play an important role in increased expression levels of oxLDL scavenger receptors on the surface of macrophages and endothelial cells that leads to deposition of oxLDL and macrophages in vascular walls.The present study intends to show the effects of ?-d-mannuronic acid (M2000) on the expression profile of ox-LDL scavenger receptors (including SR-A, LOX-1, CD36, and CD68) in an experimental model of diabetes.Eighteen Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three 6-member groups of the healthy control, diabetic control, and treated rats by M2000. Diabetes was induced in rats by intraperitoneal (IP) administration of 60?mg/kg streptozotocin. The treated rats were given daily intraperitoneal injections of M2000 with a dose of 25?mg/kg for 28 days and at the end of the 28th day, their aortas were removed. The qRT-PCR technique was then used to evaluate the expression levels of the proposed gene.The gene expression levels of the SR-A, LOX-1, CD36, and CD68 significantly declined in the diabetic group that received M2000 compared with untreated diabetic rats.The M2000, as a novel NSAID is able to modify by lowering the gene expression levels of SR-A, LOX-1, CD36, and CD68 in treated rats compared to the untreated diabetic group, which may play an important role in preventing the complications that could lead to a cardioprotective efficacy."
"We investigated and compared the effects of taraxasterol, aqueous extract of T. officinale (AET) aerial part, and potassium citrate (PC) on calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystallization in vitro.CaOx crystallization was induced by adding sodium oxalate to synthetic urine. Taraxasterol (2.5, 5, 7.5 and 12.5??g/mL), extract (1, 2, 4 and 8?mg/mL), and PC (100, 150, 200 and 350?mg/mL) were subjected to anti-crystallization activities. The absorbance and %inhibition of nucleation of CaOx crystals were evaluated by spectrophotometer at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60?min and the number and morphology of crystals were studied by light microscopy after 60?min.Presence of taraxasterol, extract and PC decreased absorbance in experimental samples compared to control, significantly. The nucleation of crystals is inhibited by taraxasterol, extract, and PC (26-64, 55-63 and 60-70%, respectively). The number of CaOx crystals were decreased in presence of taraxasterol (p?<?.01), extract (p?<?.001), and PC (p?<?.001) in a dose-dependent manner. Presence of taraxasterol, extract, and PC decreased the number of CaC2O4monohydrate, while increased CaC2O4dihydrate crystals, significantly. Also, the diameter of CaC2O4dihydrate crystals was decreased in presence of taraxasterol, extract and PC, significantly.This research indicated that taraxasterol and extract have anti-crystallization activities and effectiveness of the extract is more potent than taraxasterol. It could be because of another constituent in the extract with the synergistic effect."
"Recent findings suggest that ephrinA5 (Efna5) has a novel role in female mouse fertility, in addition to its well-defined role as a neurogenesis factor. Nevertheless, its physiological roles in ovarian granulosa cells (GC) have not been determined. In this study, mouse GC were cultured and transfected with ephrin A5 siRNA and negative control to determine the effects of Efna5 on GC apoptosis, proliferation, cell cycle progression, and related signaling pathways. To understand the mode signaling, the mRNA expression levels of Efna5 receptors (Eph receptor A5, Eph receptor A3, Eph receptor A8, and Eph receptor B2) were examined. Both mRNA and protein expressions of apoptosis-related factors (Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase 8, Caspase 3, and Tnf?) and a proliferation marker, Pcna, were investigated. Additionally, the role of Efna5 on paracrine oocyte-secreted factors and steroidogenesis hormones were also explored. Efna5 silencing suppressed GC apoptosis by downregulating Bax and upregulating Bcl-2 in a Caspase 8-dependent manner. Efna5 knockdown promoted GC proliferation via p-Akt and p-ERK pathway activation. The inhibition of Efna5 enhanced BMH15 and estradiol expression, but suppressed GDF9, while progesterone level remained unaltered. These results demonstrated that Efna5 is a pro-apoptotic agent in GC and plays important role in folliculogenesis by mediating apoptosis, proliferation, and steroidogenesis in female mouse. Therefore Efna5 might be potential therapeutic target for female fertility disorders."
"The alteration of the several roles that Lamin A/C plays in the mammalian cell leads to a broad spectrum of pathologies that - all together - are named laminopathies. Among those, the Emery Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD) is of particular interest as, despite the several known mutations of Lamin A/C, the genotype-phenotype correlation still remains poorly understood; this suggests that the epigenetic background of patients might play an important role during the time course of the disease. Historically, both a mechanical role of Lamin A/C and a regulative one have been suggested as the driving force of Laminopathies; however, those two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Recent scientific evidence shows that Lamin A/C sustains the correct gene expression at the epigenetic level thanks to the Lamina Associated Domains reorganization and the crosstalk with the Polycomb Group of Proteins (PcG). Furthermore, the PcG-dependent histone mark H3K27me3 increases under mechanical stress, finally pointing out the link between the mechano-properties of the nuclear lamina and epigenetics. Here, we summarize the emerging mechanisms that could explain the high variability seen in Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy."
"Human Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (hLOXL2), a glycoprotein implicated in tumor progression and organ fibrosis, is a molecular target for anti-cancer and anti-fibrosis treatment. This glycoprotein contains three predicted N-linked glycosylation sites; one of which is near the protein's active site and at least one more is known to facilitate the protein's secretion. Since the glycosylation impacts the protein's biology, we sought to characterize the native, mammalian glycosylation profile and to determine how closely this profile is recapitulated when the protein is expressed in insect cells. All three glycosylation sites on the protein, expressed in HEK cells, were characterized individually using a mass spectrometry-based glycopeptide analysis workflow. These data were compared to the glycosylation profile of the same protein, expressed in insect cells. We found that the producer cell type imparts a substantial influence on the glycosylation of this important protein. The more relevant version, expressed in HEK cells, contains large, acidic glycoforms; these glycans are not generated in insect cells. The glycosylation differences likely have structural and functional consequences, and these data should be considered when generating protein for functional studies or for high-throughput screening campaigns."
"The inflammatory chemokine CCL5, which binds the chemokine receptor CCR5 in a two-step mechanism so as to activate signaling pathways in hematopoetic cells, plays an important role in immune surveillance, inflammation, and development, as well as in several immune system pathologies. The recently published crystal structure of CCR5 bound to a high-affinity variant of CCL5 lacks the N-terminal segment of the receptor that is post-translationally sulfated and is known to be important for high-affinity binding. Here, we report the NMR solution structure of monomeric CCL5 bound to a synthetic doubly-sulfated peptide corresponding to the missing first 27 residues of CCR5. Our structures show that two sulfated tyrosine residues, sY10 and sY14, as well as the unsulfated Y15, form a network of strong interactions with a groove on a surface of CCL5 that is formed from evolutionarily conserved basic and hydrophobic amino acids. We then use our NMR structures, in combination with available crystal data, to create an atomic model of full-length wild-type CCR5:CCL5. Our findings reveal the structural determinants involved in the recognition of CCL5 by the CCR5 N-terminus. These findings, together with existing structural data, provide a complete structural framework with which to understand the specificity of receptor:chemokine interactions.

"Pituitary adenylate-cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a 27- or 38-amino acid neuropeptide, which belongs to the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)/glucagon/secretin family. PACAP shows particularly high homology (~?68%) to VIP. Because of the high homology of the amino acid sequences of PACAP and VIP, these peptides share three class B-G-protein coupled receptors: the PAC1-Receptor (PAC1-R), the VPAC1-Receptor (VPAC1-R) and VPAC2-Receptor (VPAC2-R). These receptors have high homology to each other, and their high homology is utilized for these discoveries. This review provides mainly an overview of the history of the discovery of PACAP and its three receptors."
"The immune response of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in obesity, in particular the role of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, has not yet been fully elucidated.To characterize iNKT cells and its activation status in VAT and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in morbidly obese subjects (MO), and to analyze their association with metabolic parameters.Twenty non-obese and 20 MO subjects underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and were studied before and 6 months after RYGB. VAT and PBMC were obtained.A decrease in VAT iNKT cells from MO was found, however, not in PBMC. Visceral adipocytes from MO presented increased CD1d expression (p?=?0.032). MO presented an increase in early activated CD69+ iNKT cells in PBMC before RYGB (p?<?0.001), but not after RYGB nor in VAT, and an increase in later activated CD25+ iNKT in VAT (p?=?0.046), without differences in PBMC. The co-expression of early and later markers (CD69+CD25+) in iNKT cells was increased in MO in VAT (p?=?0.050) and PBMC (p?=?0.006), decreasing after RYGB (p?=?0.050). CD69+ iNKT and CD69+CD25+ iNKT cells in PBMC after RYGB correlated negatively with glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance levels.There is a tissue-specific phenotype and activation of iNKT cells in VAT in morbid obesity, which could be involved in VAT immunometabolism dysregulation. Also, the increase in CD1d expression could be to offset the lack of VAT iNKT cells."
"The exposure of organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus (GA), and lysosomes, to stress activates death mechanisms. Recently, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has been shown to be involved in cell survival. However, the relationship between TERT and the stress responses is still unclear. Here, we aimed to clarify the possible mechanisms of action through which TERT promotes cell survival by studying its effect on the stresses faced by multiple organelles in human fibroblasts.We found that TERT enhanced the survival rate of cells under ER stress, regardless of ER stress inducers such as tunicamycin (protein glycosylation inhibitor), thapsigargin (Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor), brefeldin A (protein transport inhibitor), or dithiothreitol (disulfide bond formation inhibitor). We also found that TERT enhanced the survival rate of cells under GA and lysosomal stresses.Collectively, these results suggest that TERT suppresses cell stress and promotes cell survival via different mechanisms. These findings may offer new insights into the implications of TERT in the treatment of stress-induced conditions such as aging, obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases."
"Mitochondria are widely recognized as fundamental organelles for cellular physiology and constitute the main energy source for different cellular processes. The location, morphology, and interactions of mitochondria with other organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), have emerged as critical events capable of determining cellular fate. Mitochondria-related functions have proven particularly relevant in neurons; mitochondria are necessary for proper neuronal morphogenesis and the highly energy-demanding synaptic transmission process. Mitochondrial health depends on balanced fusion-fission events, termed mitochondrial dynamics, to repair damaged organelles and/or improve the quality of mitochondrial function, ATP production, calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis, which represent some mitochondrial functions closely related to mitochondrial dynamics. Several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, have been correlated with severe mitochondrial dysfunction. In this regard, nicotine, which has been associated with relevant neuroprotective effects mainly through activation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), exerts its effects at least in part by acting directly on mitochondrial physiology and morphology. Additionally, a recent description of mitochondrial nAChR localization suggests a nicotine-dependent mitochondrial function. In the present work, we evaluated in cultured hipocampal neurons the effects of nicotine on mitochondrial dynamics by assessing mitochondrial morphology, membrane potential, as well as interactions between mitochondria, cytoskeleton and IP3R, levels of the cofactor PGC-1?, and fission-fusion-related proteins. Our results suggest that nicotine modulates mitochondrial dynamics and influences mitochondrial association from microtubules, increasing IP3receptor clustering showing modulation between mitochondria-ER communications, together with the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis."
"To describe the outcomes of endothelial keratoplasty (EK) for bullous keratopathy in eyes with a retained angle-supported anterior chamber intraocular lens (acIOL).Among 263 consecutive EK procedures, 7 DMEK and 11 DSAEK procedures were identified in eyes with an acIOL and included in the present retrospective case series. Pre- and postoperative status including ocular history, anatomical outcome and complications as well as best-corrected visual acuity was evaluated.Ocular history included complicated cataract surgery (n?=?11), ocular trauma (n?=?4) and primary intracapsular cataract extraction (n?=?3). Surgery-related complications included primary graft failure (n?=?1), graft detachment (n?=?1), endophthalmitis (n?=?1) and allograft rejection (n?=?1). A clear cornea at the final examination (14?±?4 months) was observed in 14/18 (78%), while the visual outcome was limited due to significant ocular comorbidity in 9 out of 14 uncomplicated procedures.The presented short-term outcomes suggest that both DMEK and DSAEK are feasible in eyes with an angle-supported acIOL yielding an acceptable graft survival rate in the first postoperative year."
"The aim of the present study is to assess whether postoperative residual non-enhancing volume (PRNV) is correlated and predictive of overall survival (OS) in glioblastoma (GBM) patients.We retrospectively analyzed a total 134 GBM patients obtained from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (training cohort, n?=?97) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (validation cohort, n?=?37). All patients had undergone postoperative magnetic resonance imaging immediately after surgery. We evaluated the survival outcomes with regard to PRNV. The role of possible prognostic factors that may affect survival after resection, including age, sex, preoperative Karnofsky performance status, postoperative nodular enhancement, surgically induced enhancement, and postoperative necrosis, was investigated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Additionally, a recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to identify prognostic groups.Our analyses revealed that a high PRNV (HR 1.051; p-corrected?=?0.046) and old age (HR 1.031; p-corrected?=?0.006) were independent predictors of overall survival. This trend was also observed in the validation cohort (higher PRNV: HR 1.127, p-corrected??=?0.002; older age: HR 1.034, p-corrected??=?0.022). RPA analysis identified two prognostic risk groups: low-risk group (PRNV?<?70.2 cm3; n?=?55) and high-risk group (PRNV???70.2 cm3; n?=?42). GBM patients with low PRNV had a significant survival benefit (5.6 months; p?=?0.0037).Our results demonstrate that high PRNV is associated with poor OS. Such results could be of great importance in a clinical setting, particularly in the postoperative management and monitoring of therapy."
"The heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the surface soils of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) fields in Jiangxi Province were analyzed, and the mean heavy metal concentrations were 3.55, 0.19, 25.89, 14.96, 0.25, 10.89, 27.80, and 44.00 mg/kg, respectively. Spatial distribution analysis showed that the highest concentrations were recorded in the north-western, south-western, and mid-eastern parts of the study area. The index of geo-accumulation and pollution index indicated modest enrichment with Cd and Hg, which were the only two metals posing a potentially high ecological risk to the local agricultural environment. The health risk assessment showed no considerable non-carcinogenic or carcinogenic risks for children and adults from these elements. The principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) found that the variations in the Cr and Ni concentrations were largely on account of the soil parent rocks, but the As, Cd, Cu, and Hg variations in the soil were largely owing to agricultural practices of years. However, the main factor influencing Pb and Zn was atmospheric deposition."
"A novel approach was proposed to evaluate the potential risk of organic enrichment in marine aquaculture farms without obvious environmental degradation. The approach was based on historical environmental records preserved in sediment cores, and potential risk of organic enrichment can be effectively evaluated by comparing burial fluxes of marine organic carbon (OCM) during times before and after large-scale aquaculture. A case study was conducted in Sanggou Bay. The change trends on burial fluxes of organic carbon in sediment over the past 150 years were rebuilt. OCMburial fluxes have greatly increased since the beginning of large-scale aquaculture in 1980s, reaching 16.0~16.5 times higher than that before large-scale aquaculture. The results indicate that aquaculture activities have resulted in obvious accumulation of aquacultural organic matters, although sedimental environment has not degraded seriously. Besides, if the OCMburial fluxes further increase to 3.5~7.0 times higher than that in present, sedimental environment may degrade obviously. Therefore, potential risks of organic enrichment still exist with aquaculture development in Sanggou Bay."
"Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is one of the plasma protein carrying ABO(H) blood group antigens, but the combining process of these antigens is not clear. In the present study, we examined whether plasma glycosyltransferase affects the blood group antigens on VWF. VWF expressing H-antigen (H-VWF) from blood group O and bovine serum albumin conjugated with H-antigen (H-BSA) were incubated with recombinant ?1-3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (rA-transferase) and A-plasma with or without an additional UDP-GalNAc. Transformed antigens were detected by western blotting and ELISA, using an anti-A antibody. Both H-VWF and H-BSA acquired the A-antigen after incubation with rA-transferase and UDP-GalNAc. Incubation with A-plasma very weakly converted the H-antigen on BSA and VWF to A-antigen only in the presence of supplemented UDP-GalNAc. This conversion was enhanced on desialylation of H-VWF. These results indicate that sugar chains of plasma VWF can be modified by the external glycosyltransferase, but that plasma glycosyltransferase has no effect on the blood group antigens of VWF due to its low activity and the lack of donor sugars. Further, sialic acid residues of VWF may exert a protective effect against post-translational glycosylation. Our results clearly exclude the possibility that blood group antigens of VWF are constructed extracellularly in plasma."
"An organic compound known as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is formed from reducing sugars in honey and various processed foods in acidic environments when they are heated through the Maillard reaction. In addition to processing, storage conditions affect the formation HMF, and HMF has become a suitable indicator of honey quality. HMF is easily absorbed from food through the gastrointestinal tract and, upon being metabolized into different derivatives, is excreted via urine. In addition to exerting detrimental effects (mutagenic, genotoxic, organotoxic and enzyme inhibitory), HMF, which is converted to a non-excretable, genotoxic compound called 5-sulfoxymethylfurfural, is beneficial to human health by providing antioxidative, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypoxic, anti-sickling, and anti-hyperuricemic effects. Therefore, HMF is a neo-forming contaminant that draws great attention from scientists. This review compiles updated information regarding HMF formation, detection procedures, mitigation strategies and effects of HMF on honey bees and human health."
"Was Aristotle the 'father' and founder of the epigenesis doctrine? Historically, I will argue, this question must be answered with 'no'. Aristotle did not initiate and had no access to a debate that described itself in terms of 'epigenesis' and 'preformation', and thus cannot be considered the 'father' or founder of the epigenesis-preformation controversy in a literal sense. But many ancient accounts of reproduction and embryological development contain analogies to what early modern scientist called 'epigenesis' and 'preformation', and, in this analogous sense, Aristotle can be considered a precursor of the epigenesis-preformation controversy. But is Aristotle's position actually epigenetic (in this analogous sense), as most of the traditional interpreters hold, or preformationist, as some of the recent scholars believe? I will argue against the one-sidedness of both readings that Aristotle's account of reproduction and heredity contains mainly epigenetic, but also a few preformationist characteristics. Whereas, for instance, Aristotle's idea of a successive development of the embryo's parts is doubtlessly epigenetic, Aristotle's idea that the development of the embryo is an actualization and enlargement of potential parts, which are simultaneously present in the semen, can be considered a preformationist feature."
"To calculate the concentrations of interleukin 15 (IL-15) in follicular fluid (FF) and evaluate their relation with oocyte maturation, follicle size, and patients' body mass index (BMI) and age.Follicular fluid specimens were obtained from 56 subfertile women undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) during oocyte retrieval for measurement of IL-15 concentrations with ELISA. Wilcoxon's test and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used to correlate FF concentrations of IL-15 with follicular size and stage of oocyte maturation, along with patients' BMI and age.IL-15 concentrations in FF of follicles with immature oocytes were significantly greater than those from follicles with mature ones (median 5.333 vs. 3.250 pg/ml, respectively, p?<?0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between IL-15 concentrations and follicle size (r?=?-?0.333, p?=?0.003). No significant correlation was observed between IL-15 concentrations and patients' BMI and age (p?>?0.05).IL-15 concentrations in FF are adversely related with the size of the follicles and the maturity of the corresponding retrieved oocytes in a cohort of expected normal responders undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Follicular fluid concentrations of IL-15 should be investigated as a possible predictive factor for oocyte maturity."
"Viral gastroenteritis is a major public health problem worldwide. In Iran, very limited studies have been performed with regard to the epidemiology of noroviruses. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of GII noroviruses in hospitalized children less than 5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis (AGE). A total of 210 stool specimens were collected from Ali Asghar Children's Hospital and Bahrami Children's Hospital in Tehran, from June 2015 to June 2016. The samples were screened by real-time RT-PCR for genogroup II (GII). Positive samples were genotyped by semi-nested PCR followed by Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Norovirus was identified in 36 (17.1%) of 210 specimens. Based on genetic analysis of RdRp and capsid sequences, the strains were clustered into eight RdRp-capsid genotypes: GII.P4-GII.4 Sydney_2012 (41.7%), GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney_2012 (30.6%), GII.P21-GII.3 (13.9%), GII.P16-GII.4 Sydney_2012 (2.8%), GII.P16-GII.12 (2.8%), GII.P2-GII.4 Sydney_2012 (2.8%), GII.P7-GII.7 (2.8%) and GII.P2-GII.2 (2.8%). We determined several different co-circulating norovirus genotypes in children?<?5 years of age with AGE in our hospital in Tehran, Iran. Continued molecular surveillance of noroviruses, including typing of both RdRp and capsid genes, is important for monitoring emerging strains in our continued efforts to reduce the overall burden of norovirus disease."
"During aetiological study of diseased red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) using high throughput sequencing, a novel virus with a 10 kb genome divided into two segments was discovered. The virus, tentatively named red clover associated varicosavirus (RCaVV), is phylogenetically related to classifiable members of the genus Varicosavirus (family Rhabdoviridae, order Mononegavirales). Analysis of mRNA levels from the individual RCaVV genes suggested possible differences in transcription regulation between rhabdoviruses with divided and undivided genomes."
"Adult-onset type 1 diabetes, in which the 65 kDa isoform of GAD (GAD65) is a major autoantigen, has a broad clinical phenotype encompassing variable need for insulin therapy. This study aimed to evaluate whether autoantibodies against N-terminally truncated GAD65 more closely defined a type 1 diabetes phenotype associated with insulin therapy.Of 1114 participants with adult-onset diabetes from the Action LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults) study with sufficient sera, we selected those designated type 1 (n?=?511) or type 2 diabetes (n?=?603) and retested the samples in radiobinding assays for human full-length GAD65 autoantibodies (f-GADA) and N-terminally truncated (amino acids 96-585) GAD65 autoantibodies (t-GADA). Individuals' clinical phenotypes were analysed according to antibody binding patterns.Overall, 478 individuals were f-GADA-positive, 431 were t-GADA-positive and 628 were negative in both assays. Risk of insulin treatment was augmented in t-GADA-positive individuals (OR 4.69 [95% CI 3.57, 6.17]) compared with f-GADA-positive individuals (OR 3.86 [95% CI 2.95, 5.06]), irrespective of diabetes duration. Of 55 individuals who were f-GADA-positive but t-GADA-negative, i.e. with antibody binding restricted to the N-terminus of GAD65, the phenotype was similar to type 2 diabetes with low risk of progression to insulin treatment. Compared with these individuals with N-terminal GAD65-restricted GADA, t-GADA-positive individuals were younger at diagnosis (p?=?0.005), leaner (p?<?0.0001) and more often had multiple diabetes-associated autoantibodies (28.3% vs 7.3%; p?=?0.0005).In individuals with adult-onset diabetes, presence of N-terminally truncated GAD65 autoantibodies is associated with the clinical phenotype of autoimmune type 1 diabetes and predicts insulin therapy."
"Solitary fibrous tumours (SFTs) occurring in the spine are rare. Herein, we review the clinical and imaging data of spinal SFT.We retrospectively analysed eight cases of pathologically confirmed spinal SFT imaging and clinical data, pathological manifestations, surgical methods, and follow-up results.Five SFTs cases occurred in the cervical spine, two in the thoracic spine, and one in the lumbosacral spine. Five cases showed a dumbbell-shaped or lobulated soft tissue mass that grew across the intervertebral foramen, two cases showed an expansive intraosseous mass formation in the vertebral body and/or posterior element, and one case showed a long-spindle shaped intraspinal canal mass growing along the spinal canal. Seven caused local invasion and destruction of the vertebral body and posterior element. Benign SFTs displayed a good prognosis, whereas malignant SFTs were prone to recurrence and metastasis (3/4).Spinal SFTs are difficult to characterise with imaging and required pathological and immunohistochemical investigation. Prolonged follow-up is recommended once a diagnosis of spinal SFTs has been established because of the unclear biology. Spinal solitary fibrous tumours are extremely rare.  SFTs should be showed the differential of masses developing though the foramen.  Combing imaging with pathology and immunochemistry assesses the diagnosis and establish nature."
"To evaluate the technical feasibility of direct Eustachian tube catheterisation and subtraction Eustachian tubography in a cadaver model.A total of 12 separate sessions were performed on both sides of the Eustachian tube (ET) in six human cadavers. Cadavers were positioned for the submentovertical view on a fluoroscopy table. Endoscopy-guided ET selection was used in the first three cadavers, whereas fluoroscopy-guided ET selection was used in the remaining three. Eustachian tubography was performed by injecting 2 ml of contrast media through a 5-Fr catheter. We recorded the success of ET selection, number of attempts, procedure time, and tubography quality using native and subtraction images (range, 0-3).Both endoscopy- and fluoroscopy-guided selections were successfully performed in five of six sessions (83.3%). There were no statistically significant differences between the endoscopy- and fluoroscopy-guided procedures in terms of the number of attempts, procedure time, rate of immediate contrast leak to the middle ear cavity, and quality of tubography (p > 0.05). An excellent quality of tubography was obtained in 83.3% (10 of 12 sessions) of subtraction images and in 33.3% (4 of 12 sessions) of native images. The tubography quality score was significantly higher for the subtraction images than for the native images (p = 0.04).Subtraction Eustachian tubography using direct catheterisation seems to be technically feasible. The entire ET can be well visualised; thus, this technique can be used as a simple tool for assessment of ET function and anatomy. Direct catheterisation of the Eustachian tube is technically feasible.  The entire Eustachian tube could be well visualised by direct Eustachian tubography.  Subtraction Eustachian tubography images have better image quality than native images.  Subtraction Eustachian tubography can provide objective assessment of ET function and anatomy."
"OsEXPA10 gene coordinates the balance between rice development and biotic resistance. Expansins are proteins that can loosen the cell wall. Previous studies have indicated that expansin-encoding genes were involved in defense against abiotic stress, but little is known about the involvement of expansins in biotic stress. Brown planthopper (BPH) is one of the worst insect pests of rice in the Asia-Pacific planting area, and many efforts have been made to identify and clone BPH-resistance genes for use in breeding resistant cultivars. At the same time, rice blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea is one of the three major diseases that severely affect rice production worldwide. Here, we demonstrated that one rice expansin-encoding gene, OsEXPA10, functions in both rice growth and biotic resistance. Over expression of OsEXPA10 improved rice growth but also increased susceptibility to BPH infestation and blast attack, while knock-down OsEXPA10 gene expression resulted in reduced plant height and grain size, but also increased resistance to BPH and the blast pathogen. These results imply that OsEXPA10 mediates the balance between rice development and biotic resistance."
"We present a mechanism of intriguing polar hydrophobicity of a series of naturally formed minerals: their surface cavities can effectively trap water molecules, and the water trapping remarkably disrupts the hydrogen bond interaction among interfacial water and leads to considerable hydrophobicity. Diminishing water trapping by decreasing surface roughness can considerably enhance wettability, which illustrates that a Wenzel model is no longer valid for polar materials with atomic-scale roughness."

"Advances in electrophysiological experiments have led to the discovery of mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs) and the identification of the physiological function of specific MSCs. They are believed to play important roles in mechanosensitive pathways by allowing for cells to sense their mechanical environment. However, the physiological function of many MSCs has not been conclusively identified. Therefore, experiments have been developed that expose cells to various mechanical loads, such as shear flow, membrane indentation, osmotic challenges and hydrostatic pressure. In line with these experiments, mechanical unloading, as experienced in microgravity, represents an interesting alternative condition, since exposure to microgravity leads to a series of physiological adaption processes. As outlined in this review, electrophysiological experiments performed in microgravity have shown an influence of gravity on biological functions depending on ion channels at all hierarchical levels, from the cellular level to organs. In this context, calcium signaling represents an interesting cellular pathway, as it involves the direct action of calcium-permeable ion channels, and specific gravitatic cells have linked graviperception to this pathway. Multiple key proteins in the graviperception pathways have been identified. However, measurements on vertebrae cells have revealed controversial results. In conclusion, electrophysiological experiments in microgravity have shown that ion-channel-dependent physiological processes are altered in mechanically unloaded conditions. Future experiments may provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms."
"Higher-order visual thalamus plays a fundamental but poorly understood role in attention-demanding tasks. To investigate how neuronal dynamics in higher-order visual thalamus are modulated by sustained attention, we performed multichannel electrophysiological recordings in the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex (LP/pulvinar) in the ferret (Mustela putorius furo). We recorded single unit activity and local field potential (LFP) during the performance of the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), which is used in both humans and animals as an assay of sustained attention. We found that half of the units exhibited an increasing firing rate during the delay period before stimulus onset (attention-modulated units). In contrast, the non-attention-modulated units responded to the stimulus, but not during the delay period. Spike-field coherence (SFC) of only the attention-modulated neurons significantly increased from the start of the delay period until screen touch, predominantly in the ? frequency band. In addition, ? power and ?/? phase amplitude coupling (PAC) were elevated throughout the delay period. Our findings suggest that the ? oscillation plays a central role in orchestrating thalamic signaling during sustained attention."
"Our previous studies have shown that islet stellate cell (ISC), similar to pancreatic stellate cell (PSC) in phenotype and biological characters, may be responsible for the islet fibrosis in type 2 diabetes. To further identify the differences between PSC and ISC and for better understanding of the physiological function of ISC, we employed genome-wide transcriptional analysis on the PSCs and ISCs of Wistar rats.PSCs and ISCs from each rat were primarily cultured at the same condition. Genome-wide transcriptional sequence of stellate cells was generated. The identified differentially expressed genes were validated using RT-PCR.32 significant differentially expressed genes between PSCs and ISCs were identified. Moreover, collagen type 11a1 (COL11A1), was found to be expressed 2.91-fold higher in ISCs compared with PSCs, indicating that COL11A1 might be a potential key gene modulating the differences between PSC and ISC.Our study identified and validated the differences between PSC and ISC in genome-wide transcriptional scale, confirming the assumption that ISC and PSC are similar other than identical. Moreover, our data might be instrumental for further investigation of ISC and islet fibrosis, and some differential expressed genes may provide an insight into new therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes."
"External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is one of the curative treatment options for prostate cancer patients. The aim of this treatment option is to irradiate tumor tissue, while sparing normal tissue as much as possible. Frequent imaging during the course of the treatment (image guided radiotherapy) allows for determination of the location and shape of the prostate (target) and of the organs at risk. This information is used to increase accuracy in radiation dose delivery resulting in better tumor control and lower toxicity. Ultrasound imaging is harmless for the patient, it is cost-effective, and it allows for real-time volumetric organ tracking. For these reasons, it is an ideal technique for image guidance during EBRT workflows. Review papers have been published in which the use of ultrasound imaging in EBRT workflows for different cancer sites (prostate, breast, etc.) was extensively covered. This new review paper aims at providing the readers with an update on the current status for prostate cancer ultrasound guided EBRT treatments."
"Breast cancer (BC) has varied morphological and biological features and is classified based on molecular and morphological examinations. Molecular classification of BC is based on biological gene-expression profiling. In this study, biomarker modulation was assessed during BC treatment in 30 previously untreated patients. Heterogeneity among patients was pathologically diagnosed and classified into luminal and basal-like immunohistochemical profiles based on estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor (ER/PR/HER2) status. Marker heterogeneity was compared with mRNA biomarker expression in patients with BC before and after therapy. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed for molecular characterization. Expression and modulation of biological markers, CK19, hMAM, CEA, MUC, Myc, Ki-67, HER2/neu, ErbB2, and ER, were assessed after treatment, where the expression of the biomarkers CK19, Ki-67, Myc, and CEA was noted to be significantly decreased. Marker expression modulation was determined according to different stages and pathological characteristics of patients; coexpression of three markers (CK19, Ki-67, and Myc) was specifically modulated after therapy. In the histopathologically classified basal-like group, two markers (CK19 and Ki-67) were downregulated and could be considered as diagnostic biomarkers. In conclusion, pathological characteristics and marker variation levels can be evaluated to decide a personalized treatment for patients."
"Endochondral ossification (EO), by which long bones of the axial skeleton form, is a tightly regulated process involving chondrocyte maturation with successive stages of proliferation, maturation, and hypertrophy, accompanied by cartilage matrix synthesis, calcification, and angiogenesis, followed by osteoblast-mediated ossification. This developmental sequence reappears during fracture repair and in osteoarthritic etiopathology. These similarities suggest that EO, and the cells involved, are of great clinical importance for bone regeneration as it could provide novel targeted approaches to increase specific signaling to promote fracture healing, and if regulated appropriately in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The long-held accepted dogma states that hypertrophic chondrocytes are terminally differentiated and will eventually undergo apoptosis. In this mini review, we will explore recent evidence from experiments that revisit the idea that hypertrophic chondrocytes have pluripotent capacity and may instead transdifferentiate into a specific sub-population of osteoblast cells. There are multiple lines of evidence, including our own, showing that local, selective alterations in cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling also indelibly alter bone quality. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that osteoblast behavior in long bones is regulated by a combination of their lineage origins and the epigenetic effects of chondrocyte-derived ECM which they encounter during their recruitment. Further exploration of these processes could help to unlock potential novel targets for bone repair and regeneration and in the treatment of osteoarthritis."
"TheLippia alba(Mill.) N.E. Brown (Verbenaceae) species, has effects sedative, analgesic and spasmolytic properties. This study had as its main objective to evaluate the essential oil ofL. alba(EOLa) effect and that of its main constituents, citral and limonene, over tracheal smooth muscle from Wistar rats. EOLa, citral and limonene promoted relaxation of tracheal smooth muscle in contractions induced by potassium (60?mM?K+), presenting an EC50of 148?±?7??g/mL for the EOLa, 136?±?7??g/mL for citral and 581?±?7??g/mL for limonene. In contractions induced by Acetylcholine (Ach; 10??M) the EC50for the EOLa and citral were of 731?±?5??g/mL and 795?±?9??g/mL, respectively. In preparations pre-incubated with 1000??g/mL of the EOLa and citral, both agents were found to block the influx of BaCl2by VOCCs. This study demonstrated that the EOLa and its main component citral present antispasmodic effect over tracheal smooth muscle of rats."
"The construction of inorganic-protein hybrid microcapsules by using bovine serum albumin, metal ion clusters, and poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) nanoconjugates as building blocks is presented. These microcapsules have robust membranes, which can keep their spherical morphology. They support interfacial catalytic activity by the ion clusters on their surface, and can be used as a platform to immobilize enzyme on the interface of oil/water to increase the diversity and efficiency of catalysis. These microcapsules also act as a container to make materials away from bacteria when existing silver clusters on the membrane. The obtained results highlight the construction of these microcompartments. These novel microcompartments can provide some new opportunities in bottom-up synthetic biology, bioinspired microstorage/ microreactor, and drug/gene delivery in the future."
"Stem cell migration and interaction with pathology are critical to understand the complexity and status of disease recovery progress. However, the dynamic visualization still remains a great challenge due to imaging technical limitation, cell labeling difficulty, or blood-brain barrier (BBB). Herein, fast photoacoustic tomography (PAT) with optical molecular probes is applied to noninvasively monitor traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its rehabilitation. The vascular distribution and TBI hemorrhage are clearly imaged, longitudinally monitored, and quantified. Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) labeled with modified Prussian blue particles (PBPs), excellent near-infrared dyes and photoacoustic contrasts, are intravenously injected to the mice for improved observation and efficient therapy. BMSCs are demonstrated to be capable of overcoming BBB with enhanced delivery of PBPs to the brain parenchyma. Notably, the versatile BMSCs are observed by PAT to home to the damage region and repair the ruptured vasculature. Moreover, the wound treated by BMSCs exhibits much faster recovery speed than that without treatment. These findings can potentially provide a new noninvasive and high-resolution approach to image TBI, monitor recovery process, and especially trace BMSCs. This study will stimulate extensive researches on brain diseases and provide promising strategies of dye labeled BMSCs in regenerative medicine."
"Carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP or STUB1) is an E3 ligase and regulates the stability of several proteins which are involved in different cellular functions. Our previous studies demonstrated thatChipdeficient mice display bone loss phenotype due to increased osteoclast formation through enhancing TRAF6 activity in osteoclasts. In this study we provide novel evidence about the function of CHIP. We found that osteoblast differentiation and bone formation were also decreased inChipKO mice. In bone marrow stromal (BMS) cells derived fromChip-/-mice, expression of a panel of osteoblast marker genes was significantly decreased. ALP activity and mineralized bone matrix formation were also reduced inChip-deficient BMS cells. We also found that in addition to the regulation of TRAF6, CHIP also inhibits TNF?-induced NF-?B signaling through promoting TRAF2 and TRAF5 degradation. Specific deletion ofChipin BMS cells downregulated expression of osteoblast marker genes which could be reversed by the addition of NF-?B inhibitor. These results demonstrate that the osteopenic phenotype observed inChip-/-mice was due to the combination of increased osteoclast formation and decreased osteoblast differentiation. Taken together, our findings indicate a significant role of CHIP in bone remodeling."
"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been instrumental in understanding complex phenotypic traits. However, they have rarely been used to understand lineage-specific pathways and functions that contribute to the trait. In this study, by integrating lineage-specific enhancers from mesenchymal and myeloid compartments with bone mineral density loci, we were able to segregate osteoblast- and osteoclast (OC)-specific functions. Specifically, in OCs, a PU.1-dependent transcription factor (TF) network was revealed. Deletion of PU.1 in OCs in mice resulted in severe osteopetrosis. Functional genomic analysis indicated PU.1 and MITF orchestrated a TF network essential for OC differentiation. Several of these TFs were regulated by cooperative binding of PU.1 with BRD4 to form superenhancers. Further, PU.1 is essential for conformational changes in the superenhancer region of Nfatc1. In summary, our study demonstrates that combining GWASs with genome-wide binding studies and model organisms could decipher lineage-specific pathways contributing to complex disease states."
"Connective tissue diseases of the skin are characterized by excessive collagen deposition in the skin and internal organs. Fibroblasts play a pivotal role in the clinical presentation of these conditions. Nuclear receptor peroxisome-proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are therapeutic targets for dermal fibrosis, but the contribution of the different PPAR subtypes are poorly understood. Particularly, the role of fibroblast PPAR?/? in dermal fibrosis has not been elucidated. Thus, we generated a mouse strain with selective deletion of PPAR?/? in the fibroblast (FSPCre-Pparb/d-/-) and interrogated its epidermal and dermal transcriptome profiles. We uncovered a downregulated gene, leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein-1 (Lrg1), of previously unknown function in skin development and architecture. Our findings suggest that the regulation ofLrg1by PPAR?/? in fibroblasts is an important signaling conduit integrating PPAR?/? and TGF?1-signaling networks in skin health and disease. Thus, the FSPCre-Pparb/d-/-mouse model could serve as a novel tool in the current gunnery of animal models to better understand dermal fibrosis."
"Anthracnose causes severe losses of tea production in China. Although genes and biological processes involved in anthracnose resistance have been reported in other plants, the molecular response to anthracnose in tea plant is unknown. We used the susceptible tea cultivar Longjing 43 and the resistant cultivar Zhongcha 108 as materials and compared transcriptome changes in the leaves of both cultivars followingColletotrichum fructicolainoculation. In all, 9015 and 8624 genes were differentially expressed between the resistant and susceptible cultivars and their controls (0?h), respectively. In both cultivars, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in 215 pathways, including responses to sugar metabolism, phytohormones, reactive oxygen species (ROS), biotic stimuli and signalling, transmembrane transporter activity, protease activity and signalling receptor activity, but DEG expression levels were higher in Zhongcha 108 than in Longjing 43. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs showed that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) metabolism, cell death, secondary metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism are involved in the defence of Zhongcha 108, and 88 key genes were identified. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network demonstrated that putative mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are activated by resistance (R) genes and mediate downstream defence responses. Histochemical analysis subsequently validated the strong hypersensitive response (HR) and H2O2accumulation that occurred around the hyphal infection sites in Zhongcha 108. Overall, our results indicate that the HR and H2O2are critical mechanisms in tea plant defence against anthracnose and may be activated by R genes via MAPK cascades."
"The complex yet interrelated connections between cancer metabolism and oncogenic driver genes are relatively unexplored but have the potential to identify novel biomarkers and drug targets with prognostic and therapeutic value. The goal of this study was to identify global metabolic profiles of breast tumors isolated from multiple transgenic mouse models and to identify unique metabolic signatures driven by these oncogenes.Using mass spectrometry (GC-MS, LC-MS/MS, and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)-MS platforms), we quantified and compared the levels of 374 metabolites in breast tissue from normal and transgenic mouse breast cancer models overexpressing a panel of oncogenes (PyMT, PyMT-DB, Wnt1, Neu, and C3-TAg). We also compared the mouse metabolomics data to published human metabolomics data already linked to clinical data.Through analysis of our metabolomics data, we identified metabolic differences between normal and tumor breast tissues as well as metabolic differences unique to each initiating oncogene. We also quantified the metabolic profiles of the mammary fat pad versus mammary epithelium by CZE-MS/MS. However, the differences between the tissues did not account for the majority of the metabolic differences between the normal mammary gland and breast tumor tissues. Therefore, the differences between the cohorts were unlikely due to cellular heterogeneity. Of the mouse models used in this study, C3-TAg was the only cohort with a tumor metabolic signature composed of ten metabolites that had significant prognostic value in breast cancer patients. Gene expression analysis identified candidate genes that may contribute to the metabolic reprogramming.This study identifies oncogene-induced metabolic reprogramming within mouse breast tumors and compares the results to that of human breast tumors, providing a unique look at the relationship between and clinical value of oncogene initiation and metabolism during breast cancer."
"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have identified elevated levels of the phospholipid precursor phosphocholine (PC) and phosphoethanolamine (PE) as metabolic hallmarks of cancer. Unusually, however, PC and PE levels are reduced in mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDHmut) gliomas that produce the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) relative to wild-type IDH1 (IDHwt) gliomas. The goal of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism underlying this unusual metabolic reprogramming in IDHmut gliomas.Steady-state PC and PE were quantified using31P-MRS. To quantify de novo PC and PE synthesis, we used13C-MRS and measured flux to13C-PC and13C-PE in cells incubated with [1,2-13C]-choline and [1,2-13C]-ethanolamine. The activities of choline kinase (CK) and ethanolamine kinase (EK), the enzymes responsible for PC and PE synthesis, were quantified using31P-MR-based assays. To interrogate the role of 2-HG, we examined IDHwt cells incubated with 2-HG and, conversely, IDHmut cells treated with the IDHmut inhibitor AGI-5198. To examine the role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-? (HIF-1?), we silenced HIF-1? using RNA interference. To confirm our findings in vivo and in the clinic, we studied IDHwt and IDHmut orthotopic tumor xenografts and glioma patient biopsies.De novo synthesis of PC and PE was reduced in IDHmut cells relative to IDHwt. Concomitantly, CK activity and EK activity were reduced in IDHmut cells. Pharmacological manipulation of 2-HG levels established that 2-HG was responsible for reduced CK activity, EK activity, PC and PE. 2-HG has previously been reported to stabilize levels of HIF-1?, a known regulator of CK activity. Silencing HIF-1? in IDHmut cells restored CK activity, EK activity, PC and PE to IDHwt levels. Our findings were recapitulated in IDHmut orthotopic tumor xenografts and, most importantly, in IDHmut patient biopsies, validating our findings in vivo and in the clinic.This study identifies, to our knowledge for the first time, a direct role for 2-HG in the downregulation of CK and EK activity, and thereby, PC and PE synthesis in IDHmut gliomas. These results highlight the unusual reprogramming of phospholipid metabolism in IDHmut gliomas and have implications for the identification of MRS-detectable metabolic biomarkers associated with 2-HG status."
"Ambiguities and errors in the structural assignment of organic molecules hinder both drug discovery and total synthesis efforts. Newly described NMR experimental approaches can provide valuable structural details and a complementary means of structure verification. The caulamidines are trihalogenated alkaloids from a marine bryozoan with an unprecedented structural scaffold. Their unique carbon and nitrogen framework was deduced by conventional NMR methods supplemented by new experiments that define 2-bond heteronuclear connectivities, reveal very long-range connectivity data, or visualize the35,37Cl isotopic effect on chlorinated carbons. Computer-assisted structural elucidation (CASE) analysis of the spectroscopic data for caulamidine A provided only one viable structural alternative. Anisotropic NMR parameters, specifically residual dipolar coupling and residual chemical shift anisotropy data, were measured for caulamidine A and compared to DFT-calculated values for the proposed structure, the CASE-derived alternative structure, and two energetically feasible stereoisomers. Anisotropy-based NMR experiments provide a global, orthogonal means to verify complex structures free from investigator bias. The anisotropic NMR data were fully consistent with the assigned structure and configuration of caulamidine A. Caulamidine B has the same heterocyclic scaffold as A but a different composition and pattern of halogen substitution. Caulamidines A and B inhibited both wild-type and drug-resistant strains of the malaria parasitePlasmodium falciparumat low micromolar concentrations, yet were nontoxic to human cells."
"The behaviour of biomolecular systems is governed by their thermodynamic and kinetic properties. It is thus important to be able to calculate, for example, both the affinity and rate of binding and dissociation of a protein-ligand complex, or the populations and exchange rates between distinct conformational states. Because these are typically rare events, calculating these properties from long molecular dynamics simulations remains extremely difficult. Instead, one often adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy in which equilibrium free-energy differences and the fastest state-to-state transition (e.g.ligand association or minor-to-major state conversion) are combined to estimate the slow rate (e.g.ligand dissociation) using a two-state assumption. Here we instead address these problems by using a previously developed method to calculate both the forward and backward rates directly from simulations. We then estimate the thermodynamics from the rates, and validate these values by independent means. We applied the approach to three systems of increasing complexity, including the association and dissociation of benzene to a fully buried cavity inside the L99A mutant variant of T4 lysozyme. In particular, we were able to determine both millisecond association and dissociation rates, and the affinity, of the protein-ligand system by directly observing dozens of rare events in atomic detail. Our approach both sheds light on the precision of methods for calculating kinetics and further provides a generally useful test for the internal consistency of kinetics and thermodynamics. We also expect our route to be useful for obtaining both the kinetics and thermodynamics at the same time in more challenging cases."
"To achieve a systems-based approach to targeting the antioxidant pathway, 1,4-naphthoquinone annulated N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) [bis(1,3-dimesityl-4,5-naphthoquino-imidazol-2-ylidene)-gold(i)] [silver(i) dichloride] (1), [bis(1,3-dimesityl-4,5-naphthoquino-imidazol-2-ylidene)-gold(i)] chloride (2), and 1,3-dimesityl-4,5-naphthoquino-imidazol-2-ylidene)-gold(i) chloride (3)) were designed, synthesized, and tested for biological activity in a series of human cancer cell lines. The solution phase of complexes1-3were assigned using several spectroscopy techniques, including NMR spectroscopic analysis. Complexes1and3were further characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical studies revealed that quinone reductions are reversible and that the electrochemically generated semiquinone and quinone dianions are stable under these conditions. Complex1, containing two NHC-quinone moieties (to accentuate exogenous ROSviaredox cycling) centered around a Au(i) center (to inactivate thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) irreversibly), was found to inhibit cancer cell proliferation to a much greater extent than the individual components (i.e., Au(i)-NHC alone or naphthoquinone alone). Treatment of A549 lung cancer cells with1produced a 27-fold increase in exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) which was found to localize to the mitochondria. The inhibition of TrxR, an essential mediator of ROS homeostasis, was achieved in the same cell line at low administrated concentrations of1. TrxR inhibition by1was similar to that of auranofin, a gold(i) containing complex known to inhibit TrxR irreversibly. Complex1was found to induce cell deathviaan apoptotic mechanism as confirmed by annexin-V staining. Complex1was demonstrated to be efficacious in zebrafish bearing A549 xenografts. These results provide support for the suggestion that a dual targeting approach that involves reducing ROS tolerance while concurrently increasing ROS production can perturb antioxidant homeostasis, enhance cancer cell deathin vitro, and reduce tumor burdenin vivo, as inferred from preliminary zebra fish model studies."
"Ternary transition state analogue (TSA) complexes probing the isomerization of ?-d-glucose 1-phosphate (G1P) into d-glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) catalyzed by catalytically active, fluorinated (5-fluorotryptophan), ?-phosphoglucomutase (?PGM) have been observed directly by19F NMR spectroscopy. In these complexes MgF3-and AlF4-are surrogates for the transferring phosphate. However, the relevance of these metal fluorides as TSA complexes has been queried. The 1D19F spectrum of a ternary TSA complex presented a molar equivalence between fluorinated enzyme, metal fluoride and non-isomerizable fluoromethylenephosphonate substrate analogue. Ring flips of the 5-fluoroindole ring remote from the active site were observed by both19F NMR and X-ray crystallography, but did not perturb function. This data unequivocally demonstrates that the concentration of the metal fluoride complexes is equivalent to the concentration of enzyme and ligand in the TSA complex in aqueous solution."
"Understanding the relationship between the structure of light-harvesting systems and their excitation energy transfer properties is of fundamental importance in many applications including the development of next generation photovoltaics. Natural light harvesting in photosynthesis shows remarkable excitation energy transfer properties, which suggests that pigment-protein complexes could serve as blueprints for the design of nature inspired devices. Mechanistic insights into energy transport dynamics can be gained by leveraging numerically involved propagation schemes such as the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). Solving these equations, however, is computationally costly due to the adverse scaling with the number of pigments. Therefore virtual high-throughput screening, which has become a powerful tool in material discovery, is less readily applicable for the search of novel excitonic devices. We propose the use of artificial neural networks to bypass the computational limitations of established techniques for exploring the structure-dynamics relation in excitonic systems. Once trained, our neural networks reduce computational costs by several orders of magnitudes. Our predicted transfer times and transfer efficiencies exhibit similar or even higher accuracies than frequently used approximate methods such as secular Redfield theory."
"The critical contribution of membrane proteins in normal cellular function makes their detailed structure and functional analysis essential. Detergents, amphipathic agents with the ability to maintain membrane proteins in a soluble state in aqueous solution, have key roles in membrane protein manipulation. Structural and functional stability is a prerequisite for biophysical characterization. However, many conventional detergents are limited in their ability to stabilize membrane proteins, making development of novel detergents for membrane protein manipulation an important research area. The architecture of a detergent hydrophobic group, that directly interacts with the hydrophobic segment of membrane proteins, is a key factor in dictating their efficacy for both membrane protein solubilization and stabilization. In the current study, we developed two sets of maltoside-based detergents with four alkyl chains by introducing dendronic hydrophobic groups connected to a trimaltoside head group, designated dendronic trimaltosides (DTMs). Representative DTMs conferred enhanced stabilization to multiple membrane proteins compared to the benchmark conventional detergent, DDM. One DTM (i.e., DTM-A6) clearly outperformed DDM in stabilizing human ?2adrenergic receptor (?2AR) and its complex with Gsprotein. A further evaluation of this DTM led to a clear visualization of ?2AR-Gscomplexviaelectron microscopic analysis. Thus, the current study not only provides novel detergent tools useful for membrane protein study, but also suggests that the dendronic architecture has a role in governing detergent efficacy for membrane protein stabilization."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent but still incurable neurodegenerative form of dementia. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for delaying the onset and progression of the disease. We herein report a novel fluoro-substituted cyanine, F-SLOH, which exhibits good A? oligomer selectivity with a high binding affinity, attributed to the synergistic effect of strong ?-? stacking and intermolecular CH···O and CH···F interactions. The selectivity towards the A? oligomers in the brain was ascertained byin vitrolabelling on tissue sections andin vivolabelling through the systemic administration of F-SLOH in 7 month APP/PS1 double transgenic (Tg) and APP/PS1/Tau triple Tg mouse models. F-SLOH also shows remarkably effective inhibition on A? aggregation and highly desirable neuroprotective effects against A?-induced toxicities, including the inhibition of ROS production and Ca2+influx. Its excellent blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrability and low bio-toxicity further support its tremendous potential as a novel theranostic agent for both early diagnosis and therapy of AD."
"                    KDM
lysine demethylase family members are related to lung cancer clinical outcomes and are potential biomarkers for chemotherapeutics. However, little is known about epigenetic alterations inKDMgenes and their roles in lung cancer survival.Tumor tissue samples of 1230 early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were collected from the five independent cohorts. The 393 methylation sites inKDMgenes were extracted from epigenome-wide datasets and analyzed by weighted random forest (Ranger) in discovery phase and validation dataset, respectively. The variable importance scores (VIS) for the sites in top 5% of both discovery and validation sets were carried forward for Cox regression to further evaluate the association with patient's overall survival. TCGA transcriptomic data were used to evaluate the correlation with the corresponding DNA methylation.DNA methylation at sites cg11637544 inKDM2Aand cg26662347 inKDM1Awere in the top 5% of VIS in both discovery phase and validation for squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), which were also significantly associated with SCC survival (HRcg11637544?=?1.32, 95%CI, 1.16-1.50,P?=?1.1?×?10-4;HRcg26662347?=?1.88, 95%CI, 1.37-2.60,P?=?3.7?×?10-3), and correlated with corresponding gene expression (cg11637544 forKDM2A,P?=?1.3?×?10-10; cg26662347 forKDM1A P?=?1.5?×?10-5). In addition, by using flexible criteria for Ranger analysis followed by survival classification tree analysis, we identified four clusters for adenocarcinomas and five clusters for squamous cell carcinomas which showed a considerable difference of clinical outcomes with statistical significance.These findings highlight the association between somatic DNA methylation inKDMgenes and early-stage NSCLC patient survival, which may reveal potential epigenetic therapeutic targets."
"The presence of chemotherapy-resistant colorectal cancer stem cells (CCSCs) with KRAS mutation is thought to be one of the primary causes for treatment failure in colorectal cancer (CRC). P53, survivin, and microRNA-16-1 are challenging targets for anticancer drugs which are associated with chemoresistance in CRC. Yet, no p53-, survivin-, and microRNA-16-1-modulating drug with low toxicity but high efficacy against KRAS-mutant CCSCs have been approved for clinical application in CRC. Here, we investigated whether in vitro concentrations of DHA equal to human plasma levels, are able to modulate, Wt-p53, survivin, and microRNA-16-1 in CRC cells with stem cell-like properties.Wt-p53/KRAS-mutant CRC cells (HCT-116) with stem cell-like properties were treated with 100-, 150- and 200-?M/L DHA, after which cell number, viability, growth inhibition, Wt-p53, survivin and microRNA-16-1 expression, caspase-3 activation and apoptotic-rate were evaluated by different cellular and molecular techniques.After 24-, 48-, and 72-h treatments with 100- to 200-?M/L DHA, growth inhibition- rates were measured to be 54.7% to 59.7%, 73.% to 75.8%, and 63.3% to 97.7%, respectively. Treatment for 48 h with indicated DHA concentrations decreased cell number and viability. In addition, we observed a decrease in both the transcript and protein levels of survivin followed by 1.3- to 1.7- and 1.1- to 4.7-fold increases in the Wt-p53 accumulation and caspase-3 activation levels respectively. Treatment with 100 and 150 ?M/L DHA increased microRNA-16-1 expression levels by 1.3- to 1.7-fold and enhanced the microRNA-16-1/survivin mRNA, p53/survivin, and caspase-3/survivin protein ratios by 1.7- to 1.8-, 1.3- to 2.6-, and 1.3- to 2-fold increases respectively. A decrease in the number of live cells and an increase in the number of apoptotic cells were also observed with increasing DHA concentrations.Wt-p53, survivin, and microRNA-16-1 appear to be promising molecular targets of DHA. Thus, DHA might represent an attractive anti-tumor agent directed against KRAS-mutant CCSCs."
"Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), a liver-derived protein, plays an important role in the lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Using data available from the DiOGenes study, we assessed the link with clinical improvements (weight, plasma lipid, and insulin levels) and changes in liver markers, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), adiponectin, fetuin A and B, and cytokeratin 18 (CK-18), upon low-calorie diet (LCD) intervention. We also examined the role of genetic variation in determining the level of circulating ANGPTL3 and the relation between the identified genetic markers and markers of hepatic steatosis.DiOGenes is a multicenter, controlled dietary intervention where obese participants followed an 8-week LCD (800 kcal/day, using a meal replacement product). Plasma ANGPTL3 and liver markers were measured using the SomaLogic (Boulder, CO) platform. Protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) analyses assessed the link between more than four million common variants and the level of circulating ANGPTL3 at baseline and changes in levels during the LCD intervention.Changes in ANGPTL3 during weight loss showed only marginal association with changes in triglycerides (nominalp?=?0.02) and insulin (p?=?0.04); these results did not remain significant after correcting for multiple testing. However, significant association (after multiple-testing correction) were observed between changes in ANGPTL3 and AST during weight loss (p?=?0.004) and between ANGPTL3 and CK-18 (baselinep?=?1.03?×?10-7, during weight lossp?=?1.47?×?10-13). Our pQTL study identified two loci significantly associated with changes in ANGPTL3. One of these loci (theAPOA4-APOA5-ZNF259-BUD13gene cluster) also displayed significant association with changes in CK-18 levels during weight loss (p?=?0.007).We clarify the link between circulating levels of ANGPTL3 and specific markers of liver function. We demonstrate that changes in ANGPLT3 and CK-18 during LCD are under genetic control fromtrans-acting variants. Our results suggest an extended function of ANGPTL3 in the inflammatory state of liver steatosis and toward liver metabolic processes."
"Switchgrass (Panicum virgatumL.) is a model biofuel plant because of its high biomass, cellulose-richness, easy degradation to ethanol, and the availability of extensive genomic information. However, a little is currently known about the molecular responses of switchgrass plants to dehydration stress, especially multiple dehydration stresses.Studies on the transcriptional profiles of 35-day-old tissue culture plants revealed 741 dehydration memory genes. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis showed that these genes were enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction. Further analysis of specific pathways combined with physiological data suggested that switchgrass improved its dehydration resistance by changing various aspects of its responses to secondary dehydration stress (D2), including the regulation of abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signal transduction, the biosynthesis of osmolytes (l-proline, stachyose and trehalose), energy metabolism (i.e., metabolic process relating to photosynthetic systems, glycolysis, and the TCA cycle), and lignin biosynthesis. The transcriptional data and chemical substance assays showed that ABA was significantly accumulated during both primary (D1) and secondary (D2) dehydration stresses, whereas JA accumulated during D1 but became significantly less abundant during D2. This suggests the existence of a complicated signaling network of plant hormones in response to repeated dehydration stresses. A homology analysis focusing on switchgrass, maize, andArabidopsisrevealed the conservation and species-specific distribution of dehydration memory genes.The molecular responses of switchgrass plants to successive dehydration stresses have been systematically characterized, revealing a previously unknown transcriptional memory behavior. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of dehydration stress responses in plants.

"2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid is a renewable building block for the production of polyfurandicarboxylates, which are biodegradable polyesters expected to substitute their classical counterparts derived from fossil resources. It may be produced from bio-based 5-hydroxymethylfurfural or 5-methoxymethylfurfural, both obtained by the acidic dehydration of biomass-derived fructose. 5-Methoxymethylfurfural, which is produced in the presence of methanol, generates less by-products and exhibits better storage stability than 5-hydroxymethylfurfural being, therefore, the industrial substrate of choice.In this work, an enzymatic cascade involving three fungal oxidoreductases has been developed for the production of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid from 5-methoxymethylfurfural. Aryl-alcohol oxidase and unspecific peroxygenase act on 5-methoxymethylfurfural and its partially oxidized derivatives yielding 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, as well as methanol as a by-product. Methanol oxidase takes advantage of the methanol released for in situ producing H2O2that, along with that produced by aryl-alcohol oxidase, fuels the peroxygenase reactions. In this way, the enzymatic cascade proceeds independently, with the only input of atmospheric O2, to attain a 70% conversion of initial 5-methoxymethylfurfural. The addition of some exogenous methanol to the reaction further improves the yield to attain an almost complete conversion of 5-methoxymethylfurfural into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid.The synergistic action of aryl-alcohol oxidase and unspecific peroxygenase in the presence of 5-methoxymethylfurfural and O2is sufficient for the production of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid. The addition of methanol oxidase to the enzymatic cascade increases the 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid yields by oxidizing a reaction by-product to fuel the peroxygenase reactions."
"Compared with other general energy crops, microalgae are more compatible with desert conditions. In addition, microalgae cultivated in desert regions can be used to develop biodiesel. Therefore, screening oil-rich microalgae, and researching the algae growth, CO2fixation and oil yield in desert areas not only effectively utilize the idle desertification lands and other resources, but also reduce CO2emission.                    Monoraphidium dybowskii
LB50 can be efficiently cultured in the desert area using light resources, and lipid yield can be effectively improved using two-stage induction and semi-continuous culture modes in open raceway ponds (ORPs). Lipid content (LC) and lipid productivity (LP) were increased by 20% under two-stage industrial salt induction, whereas biomass productivity (BP) increased by 80% to enhance LP under semi-continuous mode in 5 m2ORPs. After 3 years of operation,M. dybowskiiLB50 was successfully and stably cultivated under semi-continuous mode for a month during five cycles of repeated culture in a 200 m2ORP in the desert area. This culture mode reduced the supply of the original species. The BP and CO2fixation rate were maintained at 18 and 33 g m-2 day-1, respectively. Moreover, LC decreased only during the fifth cycle of repeated culture. Evaporation occurred at 0.9-1.8 L m-2 day-1, which corresponded to 6.5-13% of evaporation loss rate. Semi-continuous and two-stage salt induction culture modes can reduce energy consumption and increase energy balance through the energy consumption analysis of life cycle.This study demonstrates the feasibility of combining biodiesel production and CO2fixation using microalgae grown as feedstock under culture modes with ORPs by using the resources in the desert area. The understanding of evaporation loss and the sustainability of semi-continuous culture render this approach practically viable. The novel strategy may be a promising alternative to existing technology for CO2emission reduction and biofuel production."
"The role ofFusobacterium nucleatumFap2 protein in the development of colorectal cancer has recently been explained. Fap2, when bound to the human inhibitory receptor, TIGIT, inhibits the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells against cancer cells, thus, allowing proliferation of the latter eventually leading to tumor growth. The aim of the study was to identify the immunogenicity of a peptide mimotope of the Fap2 protein and to determine the reactivity of colorectal cancer patients' sera against the mimotope.Immunogenic epitope of the Fap2 protein ofF. nucleatumwas selected using the B-cell epitope prediction of the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB). The immunogenicity of the synthetic peptide mimotope of the Fap2 protein was determined in animal models and reactivity of colorectal cancer patients' sera against the mimotope was done by indirect ELISA.Results show that the selected peptide mimotope, with sequence TELAYKHYFGT, of the outer membrane protein Fap2 ofF. nucleatumis immunogenic. Increase in the absorbance readings of peptide-immunized rabbit sera was observed starting Week 1 which was sustained up to Week 10 in the indirect ELISA performed. Colorectal cancer cases (n?=?37) were all reactive in an ELISA-based analysis using the mimotope as the capture antigen.In this study, we identified an immunogenic epitope of the Fap2 protein of theFusobacterium nucleatum. We demonstrated the reactivity of serum of histopathologically confirmed CRC patients in a peptide-capture indirect ELISA which may serve as proof of concept for the development of CRC diagnostics."
"                    Kluyveromyces marxianus
is traditionally associated with fermented dairy products, but can also be isolated from diverse non-dairy environments. Because of thermotolerance, rapid growth and other traits, many different strains are being developed for food and industrial applications but there is, as yet, little understanding of the genetic diversity or population genetics of this species.K. marxianusshows a high level of phenotypic variation but the only phenotype that has been clearly linked to a genetic polymorphism is lactose utilisation, which is controlled by variation in theLAC12gene. The genomes of several strains have been sequenced in recent years and, in this study, we sequenced a further nine strains from different origins. Analysis of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 strains was carried out to examine genome structure and genetic diversity. SNP diversity inK. marxianusis relatively high, with up to 3% DNA sequence divergence between alleles. It was found that the isolates include haploid, diploid, and triploid strains, as shown by both SNP analysis and flow cytometry. Diploids and triploids contain long genomic tracts showing loss of heterozygosity (LOH). All six isolates from dairy environments were diploid or triploid, whereas 6 out 7 isolates from non-dairy environment were haploid. This also correlated with the presence of functionalLAC12alleles only in dairy haplotypes. The diploids were hybrids between a non-dairy and a dairy haplotype, whereas triploids included three copies of a dairy haplotype."
"Cotton is one of the most economically important fiber crop plants worldwide. The genusGossypiumcontains a single allotetraploid group (AD) and eight diploid genome groups (A-G and K). However, the evolution of repeat sequences in the chloroplast genomes and the phylogenetic relationships ofGossypiumspecies are unclear. Thus, we determined the variations in the repeat sequences and the evolutionary relationships of 40 cotton chloroplast genomes, which represented the most diverse in the genus, including five newly sequenced diploid species, i.e.,G. nandewarense(C1-n),G. armourianum(D2-1),G. lobatum(D7),G. trilobum(D8), andG. schwendimanii(D11), and an important semi-wild race of upland cotton,G. hirsutumracelatifolium(AD1). The genome structure, gene order, and GC content of cotton species were similar to those of other higher plant plastid genomes. In total, 2860 long sequence repeats (>10 bp in length) were identified, where the F-genome species had the largest number of repeats (G. longicalyxF1: 108) and E-genome species had the lowest (G. stocksiiE1: 53). Large-scale repeat sequences possibly enrich the genetic information and maintain genome stability in cotton species. We also identified 10 divergence hotspot regions, i.e.,rpl33-rps18, psbZ-trnG(GCC),rps4-trnT(UGU),trnL(UAG)-rpl32, trnE(UUC)-trnT(GGU),atpE, ndhI, rps2, ycf1, andndhF, which could be useful molecular genetic markers for future population genetics and phylogenetic studies. Site-specific selection analysis showed that some of the coding sites of 10 chloroplast genes (atpB, atpE, rps2, rps3, petB, petD, ccsA, cemA, ycf1, andrbcL) were under protein sequence evolution. Phylogenetic analysis based on the whole plastomes suggested that theGossypiumspecies grouped into six previously identified genetic clades. Interestingly, all 13 D-genome species clustered into a strong monophyletic clade. Unexpectedly, the cotton species with C, G, and K-genomes were admixed and nested in a large clade, which could have been due to their recent radiation, incomplete lineage sorting, and introgression hybridization among different cotton lineages. In conclusion, the results of this study provide new insights into the evolution of repeat sequences in chloroplast genomes and interspecific relationships in the genusGossypium."
"                    Dickeya solani
is a Gram-negative necrotrophic, plant pathogenic bacterium able to cause symptoms in a variety of plant species worldwide. As a facultative anaerobe,D. solaniis able to infect hosts under a broad range of oxygen concentrations found in plant environments. However, little is known about oxygen-dependent gene expression inDickeyaspp. that might contribute to its success as a pathogen. Using a Tn5 transposon, harboring a promoterlessgusAreporter gene, 146 mutants ofD. solaniIPO2222 were identified that exhibited oxygen-regulated expression of the gene into which the insertion had occurred. Of these mutants 114 exhibited higher expression under normal oxygen conditions than hypoxic conditions while 32 were more highly expressed under hypoxic conditions. The plant host colonization potential and pathogenicity as well as phenotypes likely to contribute to the ecological fitness ofD. solani, including growth rate, carbon and nitrogen source utilization, production of pectinolytic enzymes, proteases, cellulases and siderophores, swimming and swarming motility and the ability to form biofilm were assessed for 37 strains exhibiting the greatest oxygen-dependent change in gene expression. Eight mutants expressed decreased ability to cause disease symptoms when inoculated into potato tubers or chicory leaves and three of these also exhibited delayed colonization of potato plants and exhibited tissue specific differences in gene expression in these various host tissues. The genes interrupted in these eight mutants encoded proteins involved in fundamental bacterial metabolism, virulence, bacteriocin and proline transport, while three encoded hypothetical or unknown proteins. The implications of environmental oxygen concentration on the ability ofD. solanito cause disease symptoms in potato are discussed."
"Ryegrass single plants, bi-parental family pools, and multi-parental family pools are often genotyped, based on allele-frequencies using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) assays. GBS assays can be performed at low-coverage depth to reduce costs. However, reducing the coverage depth leads to a higher proportion of missing data, and leads to a reduction in accuracy when identifying the allele-frequency at each locus. As a consequence of the latter, genomic relationship matrices (GRMs) will be biased. This bias in GRMs affects variance estimates and the accuracy of GBLUP for genomic prediction (GBLUP-GP). We derived equations that describe the bias from low-coverage sequencing as an effect of binomial sampling of sequence reads, and allowed for any ploidy level of the sample considered. This allowed us to combine individual and pool genotypes in one GRM, treating pool-genotypes as a polyploid genotype, equal to the total ploidy-level of the parents of the pool. Using simulated data, we verified the magnitude of the GRM bias at different coverage depths for three different kinds of ryegrass breeding material: individual genotypes from single plants, pool-genotypes from F2families, and pool-genotypes from synthetic varieties. To better handle missing data, we also tested imputation procedures, which are suited for analyzing allele-frequency genomic data. The relative advantages of the bias-correction and the imputation of missing data were evaluated using real data. We examined a large dataset, including single plants, F2families, and synthetic varieties genotyped in three GBS assays, each with a different coverage depth, and evaluated them for heading date, crown rust resistance, and seed yield. Cross validations were used to test the accuracy using GBLUP approaches, demonstrating the feasibility of predicting among different breeding material. Bias-corrected GRMs proved to increase predictive accuracies when compared with standard approaches to construct GRMs. Among the imputation methods we tested, the random forest method yielded the highest predictive accuracy. The combinations of these two methods resulted in a meaningful increase of predictive ability (up to 0.09). The possibility of predicting across individuals and pools provides new opportunities for improving ryegrass breeding schemes."
"                    Streptococcus suis
infections can cause septic shock, which is referred to as streptococcal toxic-shock-like syndrome (STSLS). The disease is characterized by a severe inflammatory response, multiple organ failure, and high mortality. However, no superantigen that is responsible for toxic shock syndrome was detected inS. suis, indicating that the mechanism underlying STSLS is different and remains to be elucidated. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1), belonging to the Ig superfamily, is an activating receptor expressed on myeloid cells, and has been recognized as a critical immunomodulator in several inflammatory diseases of both infectious and non-infectious etiologies. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the immunoregulatory functions of TREM-1 on acute infectious diseases and then highlight the crucial roles of TREM-1 on the development of STSLS."
"Bloodstream infections by the human-pathogenic fungiCandida albicansandCandida glabrataincreasingly occur in hospitalized patients and are associated with high mortality rates. The early immune response against these fungi in human blood comprises a concerted action of humoral and cellular components of the innate immune system. Upon entering the blood, the majority of fungal cells will be eliminated by innate immune cells, i.e., neutrophils and monocytes. However, recent studies identified a population of fungal cells that can evade the immune response and thereby may disseminate and cause organ dissemination, which is frequently observed during candidemia. In this study, we investigate the so far unresolved mechanism of fungal immune evasion in human whole blood by testing hypotheses with the help of mathematical modeling. We use a previously established state-based virtual infection model for whole-blood infection withC. albicansto quantify the immune response and identified the fungal immune-evasion mechanism. While this process was assumed to be spontaneous in the previous model, we now hypothesize that the immune-evasion process is mediated by host factors and incorporate such a mechanism in the model. In particular, we propose, based on previous studies that the fungal immune-evasion mechanism could possibly arise through modification of the fungal surface by as of yet unknown proteins that are assumed to be secreted by activated neutrophils. To validate or reject any of the immune-evasion mechanisms, we compared the simulation of both immune-evasion models for different infection scenarios, i.e., infection of whole blood with eitherC. albicansorC. glabrataunder non-neutropenic and neutropenic conditions. We found that under non-neutropenic conditions, both immune-evasion models fit the experimental data from whole-blood infection withC. albicansandC. glabrata. However, differences between the immune-evasion models could be observed for the infection outcome under neutropenic conditions with respect to the distribution of fungal cells across the immune cells. Based on these predictions, we suggested specific experimental studies that might allow for the validation or rejection of the proposed immune-evasion mechanism."
"Newly erupted black smokers (hydrothermal vent chimneys) are sterile during their formation, but house hyperthermophilic microorganisms in substantial amounts in later stages. No direct experimental data exist by which mechanisms hyperthermophiles colonize newly erupted black smokers, but a scenario was proposed recently how this might happen. Here we combine high temperature light microscopy with electron microscopy to show that two hyperthermophilic Archaea, namelyPyrococcus furiosus and Methanocaldococcus villosusare able to adhere onto authentic black smoker material (BSM). We especially are able to directly observe the adhesion process via video recordings taken at high temperatures. These data validate the hypothesis that hyperthermophiles are transferred by serendipitous water currents to the outside of newly formed black smokers and react within seconds to the there prevailing high temperatures by very fast movements. They scan the surface of the hydrothermal chimneys via a much slower zigzag seek-movement and adhere via their flagella at a suitable place, building up biofilms."
"Model bacteria, such asE. coliandB. subtilis, tightly regulate cell cycle progression to achieve consistent cell size distributions and replication dynamics. Many of the hallmark features of these model bacteria, including lateral cell wall elongation and symmetric growth and division, do not occur in mycobacteria. Instead, mycobacterial growth is characterized by asymmetric polar growth and division. This innate asymmetry creates unequal birth sizes and growth rates for daughter cells with each division, generating a phenotypically heterogeneous population. Although the asymmetric growth patterns of mycobacteria lead to a larger variation in birth size than typically seen in model bacterial populations, the cell size distribution is stable over time. Here, we review the cellular mechanisms of growth, division, and cell cycle progression in mycobacteria in the face of asymmetry and inherent heterogeneity. These processes coalesce to control cell size. AlthoughMycobacterium smegmatisandMycobacterium bovisBacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) utilize a novel model of cell size control, they are similar to previously studied bacteria in that initiation of DNA replication is a key checkpoint for cell division. We compare the regulation of DNA replication initiation and strategies used for cell size homeostasis in mycobacteria and model bacteria. Finally, we review the importance of cellular organization and chromosome segregation relating to the physiology of mycobacteria and consider how new frameworks could be applied across the wide spectrum of bacterial diversity."
"Sexual reproduction likely evolved as protection from environmental stresses, specifically, to repair DNA damage, often via homologous recombination. In higher eukaryotes, meiosis and the production of gametes with allelic combinations different from parental type provides the side effect of increased genetic variation. In fungi it appears that while the maintenance of meiosis is paramount for success, outcrossing is not a driving force. In the subkingdomDikarya, fungal members are characterized by existence of a dikaryon for extended stages within the life cycle. Such fungi possess functional or, in some cases, relictual, loci that govern sexual reproduction between members of their own species. All mating systems identified so far in theDikaryaemploy a pheromone/receptor system for haploid organisms to recognize a compatible mating partner, although the paradigm in the Ascomycota, e.g.,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is that genes for the pheromone precursor and receptor are not found in the mating-type locus but rather are regulated by its products. Similarly, the mating systems in the Ascomycota are bipolar, with two non-allelic idiomorphs expressed in cells of opposite mating type. In contrast, for the Basidiomycota, both bipolar and tetrapolar mating systems have been well characterized; further, at least one locus directly encodes the pheromone precursor and the receptor for the pheromone of a different mating type, while a separate locus encodes proteins that may regulate the first locus and/or additional genes required for downstream events. Heterozygosity at both of two unlinked loci is required for cells to productively mate in tetrapolar systems, whereas in bipolar systems the two loci are tightly linked. Finally, a trade-off exists in wild fungal populations between sexual reproduction and the associated costs, with adverse conditions leading to mating. For fungal mammal pathogens, the products of sexual reproduction can be targets for the host immune system. The opposite appears true for phytopathogenic fungi, where mating and pathogenicity are inextricably linked. Here, we explore, compare, and contrast different strategies used among theDikarya, both saprophytic and pathogenic fungi, and highlight differences between pathogens of mammals and pathogens of plants, providing context for selective pressures acting on this interesting group of fungi."
"Symbiotic microbial communities play key roles in the health and development of their multicellular hosts. Understanding why microbial communities vary among different host species or individuals is an important step toward understanding the diversity and function of the microbiome. The amphibian skin microbiome may affect resistance to the fungal pathogenBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis(Bd). Still, the factors that determine the diversity and composition of the amphibian skin microbiome, and therefore may ultimately contribute to disease resistance, are not well understood. We conducted a two-phase experiment to first test how host and environment shape the amphibian skin microbiome, and then test if the microbiome affects or is affected by Bd infection. Most lab experiments testing assembly of the amphibian skin microbiome so far have compared sterile to non-sterile environments or heavily augmented to non-augmented frogs. A goal of this study was to evaluate, in an experimental setting, realistic potential drivers of microbiome assembly that would be relevant to patterns observed in nature. We tested effects of frog genetic background (2 source populations) and 6 natural lake water sources in shaping the microbiome of the frogRana sierrae. Water in which frogs were housed affected the microbiome in a manner that partially mimicked patterns observed in natural populations. In particular, frogs housed in water from disease-resistant populations had greater bacterial richness than frogs housed in water from populations that died out due to Bd. However, in the experiment this difference in microbiomes did not lead to differences in host mortality or rates of pathogen load increase. Frog source population also affected the microbiome and, although none of the frogs in this study showed true resistance to infection, host source population had a small effect on the rate of pathogen load increase. This difference in infection trajectories could be due to the observed differences in the microbiome, but could also be due to other traits that differ between frogs from the two populations. In addition to examining effects of the microbiome on Bd, we tested the effect of Bd infection severity on the microbiome. Specifically, we studied a time series of the microbiome over the course of infection to test if the effects of Bd on the microbiome are dependent on Bd infection severity. Although limited to a small subset of frogs, time series analysis suggested that relative abundances of several bacterial phylotypes changed as Bd loads increased through time, indicating that Bd-induced disturbance of theR. sierraemicrobiome is not a binary effect but instead is dependent on infection severity. We conclude that both host and aquatic environment help shape theR. sierraeskin microbiome, with links to small changes in disease resistance in some cases, but in this study the effect of Bd on the microbiome was greater than the effect of the microbiome on Bd. Assessment of the microbiome differences between more distantly related populations than those studied here is needed to fully understand the role of the microbiome in resistance to Bd."
"                    Bacillus subtilis
cells can adopt different life-styles in response to various environmental cues, including planktonic cells during vegetative growth, sessile cells during biofilm formation and sporulation. While switching life-styles, bacteria must coordinate the progression of their cell cycle with their physiological status. Our current understanding of the regulatory pathways controlling the decision-making processes and triggering developmental switches highlights a key role of protein phosphorylation. The regulatory mechanisms that integrate the bacterial chromosome replication status with sporulation involve checkpoint proteins that target the replication initiator DnaA or the kinase phosphorelay controlling the master regulator Spo0A.B. subtilisYabA is known to interact with DnaA to prevent over-initiation of replication during vegetative growth. Here, we report that YabA is phosphorylated by YabT, a Ser/Thr kinase expressed during sporulation and biofilm formation. The phosphorylation of YabA has no effect on replication initiation control but hyper-phosphorylation of YabA leads to an increase in sporulation efficiency and a strong inhibition of biofilm formation. We also provide evidence that YabA phosphorylation affects the level of Spo0A-P in cells. These results indicate that YabA is a multifunctional protein with a dual role in regulating replication initiation and life-style switching, thereby providing a potential mechanism for cross-talk and coordination of cellular processes during adaptation to environmental change."
"                    Introduction:
Gestational under nutrition in rats has been shown to decrease expression of sympathetic innervation markers in peripheral tissues of offspring, including the stomach. This has been linked to lower gastric secretion and decreased circulating levels of ghrelin. Considering the critical role of leptin intake during lactation in preventing obesity and reversing adverse developmental programming effects, we aimed to find out whether leptin supplementation may reverse the above mentioned alterations caused by mild gestational calorie restriction.Methods:Three groups of male rats were studied at a juvenile age (25 days old) and during adulthood (3 and 6 months old): the offspring ofad libitumfed dams (controls), the offspring of dams that were diet restricted (20%) from days 1 to 12 of gestation (CR), and CR rats supplemented with a daily oral dose of leptin (equivalent to 5 times the average amount they could receive each day from maternal milk) throughout lactation (CR-Leptin). The density of TyrOH-immunoreactive (TyrOH+) fibers and the levels of Tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrOH)-used as potential markers of functional sympathetic innervation-were measured in stomach. Plasma leptin and ghrelin levels were also determined.Results:Twenty five-day-old CR rats, but not CR-Leptin rats, displayed lower density of TyrOH+fibers (-46%) and TyrOH levels (-47%) in stomach compared to controls. Alterations in CR animals were mitigated at 6 months of age, and differences were not significant. Adult CR-Leptin animals showed higher plasma ghrelin levels than CR animals, particularly at 3 months (+16%), and a lower leptin/ghrelin ratio (-28 and -37% at 3 and 6 months, respectively).Conclusion:Leptin intake during lactation is able to reverse the alterations in the density of TyrOH+fibers in the stomach and normalize the increased leptin/ghrelin ratio linked to a mild gestational calorie restriction in rats, supporting the relevance of leptin as an essential nutrient during lactation."
"Estimation of total number of a population of cells that are sparsely distributed in an organ or anatomically-defined region of interest represents a challenge for conventional stereological methods. In these situations, classic fractionator approaches that rely on systematic uniform random sampling are highly inefficient and, in many cases, impractical due to the intense sampling of the organ and tissue sections that is required to obtain sufficient counts for an acceptable level of precision. The proportionator, an estimator based on non-uniform sampling theory, marries automated image analysis with stereological principles and is the only estimator that provides a highly efficient and precise method to address these challenging quantification problems. In this paper, the practical considerations of the proportionator estimator and its implementation with Proportionator software and digital slide imaging are reviewed. The power of the proportionator as a stereological tool is illustrated in its application to the estimation of the total number of a very rare (~50/vertebrae) and sparsely distributed population of osteoprogenitor cells in mouse vertebral body. The proportionator offers a solution to neuroscientists interested in quantifying total cell number of sparse cell populations in the central and peripheral nervous system where systematic uniform random sampling-based stereological estimators are impractical."
"Inflammation is a complex biological response fundamental to how the body deals with injury and infection to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury and effect repair. Unlike a normally beneficial acute inflammatory response, chronic inflammation can lead to tissue damage and ultimately its destruction, and often results from an inappropriate immune response. Inflammation in the nervous system (""neuroinflammation""), especially when prolonged, can be particularly injurious. While inflammationper semay not cause disease, it contributes importantly to disease pathogenesis across both the peripheral (neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia) and central [e.g., Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, ischemia and traumatic brain injury, depression, and autism spectrum disorder] nervous systems. The existence of extensive lines of communication between the nervous system and immune system represents a fundamental principle underlying neuroinflammation. Immune cell-derived inflammatory molecules are critical for regulation of host responses to inflammation. Although these mediators can originate from various non-neuronal cells, important sources in the above neuropathologies appear to be microglia and mast cells, together with astrocytes and possibly also oligodendrocytes. Understanding neuroinflammation also requires an appreciation that non-neuronal cell-cell interactions, between both glia and mast cells and glia themselves, are an integral part of the inflammation process. Within this context the mast cell occupies a key niche in orchestrating the inflammatory process, from initiation to prolongation. This review will describe the current state of knowledge concerning the biology of neuroinflammation, emphasizing mast cell-glia and glia-glia interactions, then conclude with a consideration of how a cell's endogenous mechanisms might be leveraged to provide a therapeutic strategy to target neuroinflammation."
"About 5%-10% of breast cancer and 10%-15% of ovarian cancer are hereditary.BRCA1andBRCA2are the most common germline mutations found in both inherited breast and ovarian cancers. Once these mutations are identified and classified, a course of action to reduce the risk of developing either ovarian or breast cancer - including surveillance and surgery - is carried out.The purpose of the current research is to characterize the gene expression differences between healthy cells harboring a mutation inBRCA1/2 genes and normal cells. This will allow detection of candidate genes and help identify women who carry functionalBRCA1/2 mutations, which cannot always be detected by the available sequencing methods, for example, carriers of mutations found in regulatory sequences of the genes.Our cohort consisted of 50 healthy women, of whom 24 were individuals withBRCA1orBRCA2heterozygous mutations and 26 were non-carrier controls. RNA purified from non-irradiated lymphocytes of nineBRCA1/2 mutation carriers versus four control mutation-negative individuals was utilized for RNA-Seq analysis. The selected RNA-Seq transcripts were validated, and the levels of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) mRNA were measured by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Differences in gene expression were found when comparing untreated lymphocytes ofBRCA1/2mutation carriers and controls. Among others, theSYKgene was identified as being differently expressed forBRCA1/2 mutation carriers. The expression level ofSYKwas significantly higher in untreated healthy lymphocytes ofBRCA1heterozygote carriers compared with controls, regardless of irradiation. In contrast to normal tissues, in cancerous breast tissues, the expression levels of theBRCA1andSYKgenes were not intercorrelated.Collectively, our observations demonstrate thatSYKmay prove to be a good candidate for better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention ofBRCA1mutation-associated breast cancer."
"Follistatin (Fst) promotes brown adipocyte characteristics in adipose tissues.Abdominal fat volume (CT scan), glucose clearance (GTT test), and metabolomics analysis (mass spectrometry) of adipose tissues from Fst transgenic (Fst-Tg) and wild type (WT) control mice were analyzed. Oxygen consumption (Seahorse Analyzer) and lipidomics (gas chromatography) was analyzed in 3T3-L1 cells.Fst-Tg mice show significant decrease in abdominal fat content, increased glucose clearance, improved plasma lipid profiles and significant changes in several conventional metabolites compared to the WT mice. Furthermore, overexpression of Fst in 3T3-L1 cells resulted in up regulation of key brown/beige markers and changes in lipidomics profiles.Fst modulates key factors involved in promoting metabolic syndrome and could be used for therapeutic intervention."
"Despite the numerous reports on biological syntheses of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), little is known about the composition of their capping agents, protein corona of plant extract-mediated synthesis, and their influence on the properties of AgNPs. Here, orange (Citrus sinensis) waste was utilized as a source of an extract for AgNP synthesis (the protein corona composition of which was elucidated), and also as a starting material for hesperidin and nanocellulose extraction, which were used for bio-based AgNP synthesis. A comparison of the results using the two methods of synthesis is presented.AgNPs were synthesized using orange (C. sinensis) peel extract (Or-AgNPs) in a biological route, and using hesperidin (Hsd-AgNPs) and nanocellulose (extracted from oranges) in a green chemical route. Characterization of nanoparticles was carried out using zeta potential and hydrodynamic size measurements, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Elucidation of proteins from protein corona was performed via ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer experiments. Antimicrobial activity was assessed via minimum inhibitory concentration assays againstXanthomonas axonopodispv.citri(Xac), the bacterium that causes citric canker in oranges.Or-AgNPs were not completely uniform in morphology, having a size of 48.1±20.5 nm and a zeta potential of -19.0±0.4 mV. Stabilization was performed mainly by three proteins, which were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments. Hsd-AgNPs were smaller (25.4±12.5 nm) and had uniform morphology. Nanocellulose provided a strong steric and electrostatic (-28.2±1.0 mV) stabilization to the nanoparticles. Both AgNPs presented roughly the same activity againstXac, with the minimum inhibitory concentration range between 22 and 24 ?g mL-1.Despite the fact that different capping biomolecules on AgNPs had an influence on morphology, size, and stability of AgNPs, the antibacterial activity againstXacwas not sensitive to this parameter. Moreover, three proteins from the protein corona of Or-AgNPs were identified."
"Previous studies showed that prolonged exposure to fluoride (F-) and aluminum (Al3+) ions is associated with numerous diseases including neurological disorders. They don't have any known biological function. But they can bind with proteins that interact with ions similar to them. Such unwanted interactions affect the normal biological function of the target proteins, as well as their downstream protein-protein interactions. Several studies show the detrimental effects posed by them including Alzheimer's disease. However, their target proteins have never been reported. Here, we have screened for the human protein targets subjected to F- and Al3+ interactions by using data-driven prediction tools. We have identified 20 different proteins that directly bind with them (10 interact with fluoride and 10 with aluminum). In addition, protein-protein interaction has been explored to find the proteins that indirectly interact with F- and Al3+. We have found 86 indirect targets for F- and 90 for Al3+. Furthermore, 19 common protein targets have been identified, including proteins (9 out of 19) associated with neurodegenerative disorders. However, wet lab experiments are beyond our scopes to validate the binding networks. Additional studies must be warranted."
"Rudhira/Breast Carcinoma Amplified Sequence 3 (BCAS3) is a cytoskeletal protein that promotes directional cell migration and angiogenesis in vitro and is implicated in human carcinomas and coronary artery disease. To study the role of Rudhira during development in vivo, we generated the first knockout mouse for rudhira and show that Rudhira is essential for mouse development. Rudhira null embryos die at embryonic day (E) 9.5 accompanied by severe vascular patterning defects in embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues. To identify the molecular processes downstream of rudhira, we analyzed the transcriptome of intact knockout yolk sacs. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis showed that Rudhira functions in angiogenesis and its related processes such as cell adhesion, extracellular matrix organization, peptidase activity and TGF? signaling. Since Rudhira is also expressed in endothelial cells (ECs), we further generated Tie2Cre-mediated endothelial knockout (CKO) of rudhira. CKO embryos survive to E11.5 and similar to the global knockout, display gross vascular patterning defects, showing that endothelial Rudhira is vital for development. Further, Rudhira knockdown ECs in culture fail to sprout in a spheroid-sprouting assay, strongly supporting its role in vascular patterning. Our study identifies an essential role for Rudhira in blood vessel remodeling and provides a mouse model for cardiovascular development."
"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), a clinically symptomatic primary immunodeficiency disease (PID), is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia leading to recurrent infections and various complications. Recently, some defects in the signaling of TLRs have been identified in CVID patients which led us to investigate the expression of TLR4 and 9 negative regulatory molecules and their upregulation status following their activation. Using TaqMan real-time PCR, SOCS1, TNFAIP3, RFN216, and IRAK-M transcripts among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were measured with/without TLR4 and 9 activations. TLR4 and 9 were activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and unmethylated CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN), respectively. Production of IFN-? and TNF-? cytokines, as a part of the functional response of mentioned TLRs, was also measured using ELISA. Deficient transcripts of IRAK-M and TNFAIP3 in unstimulated PBMCs and lower production of TNF-? and IFN-? after treatments were observed. Upregulation of RFN216 and TNFAIP3 after TLR9 activation was abnormal compared to healthy individuals. Significant correlations were found between abnormal IRAK-M and TNFAIP3 transcripts, and lymphadenopathy and inflammatory scenarios in patients, respectively. It seems that the transcriptional status of some negative regulatory molecules is disturbed in CVID patients, and this could be caused by the underlying pathogenesis of CVID and could involve complications like autoimmunity and inflammatory responses."
"Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a recent and rapidly evolving method for detecting genetic lesions, such as aneuploidies, of a fetus. However, there is a need for faster and cheaper laboratory and analysis methods to make NIPT more widely accessible. We have developed a novel software package for detection of fetal aneuploidies from next-generation low-coverage whole genome sequencing data. Our tool - NIPTmer - is based on counting pre-defined per-chromosome sets of unique k-mers from raw sequencing data, and applying linear regression model on the counts. Additionally, the filtering process used for k-mer list creation allows one to take into account the genetic variance in a specific sample, thus reducing the source of uncertainty. The processing time of one sample is less than 10 CPU-minutes on a high-end workstation. NIPTmer was validated on a cohort of 583 NIPT samples and it correctly predicted 37 non-mosaic fetal aneuploidies. NIPTmer has the potential to reduce significantly the time and complexity of NIPT post-sequencing analysis compared to mapping-based methods. For non-commercial users the software package is freely available at http://bioinfo.ut.ee/NIPTMer/ ."
"Chlamydia species have recently been recognized as emerging pathogens in snakes. However, isolation of novel snake chlamydiae is critical and their growth characteristics are largely unknown. In this study, two novel chlamydial species are described: Chlamydia serpentis and Chlamydia poikilothermis, isolated after attempts on 23 cloacal and choanal swabs from 18 PCR-positive captive snakes originating from different Swiss snake collections. Isolation success, growth curve and infectivity rates over a 48-hour time period were dependent on temperature (37?°C for C. serpentis, 28?°C for C. poikilothermis). C. serpentis and C. poikilothermis were sensitive to tetracycline and moxifloxacin during evaluation by in vitro antibiotic susceptibility assay but intermediate to resistant (2-4??g/ml) to azithromycin. Whole genome sequencing of the isolates provided proof of the novel species status, and gives insights into the evolution of these branches of genus Chlamydia."
"Globally accelerating trends in societal development and human environmental impacts since the mid-twentieth century1-7are known as the Great Acceleration and have been discussed as a key indicator of the onset of the Anthropocene epoch6. While reports on ecological responses (for example, changes in species range or local extinctions) to the Great Acceleration are multiplying8, 9, it is unknown whether such biotic responses are undergoing a similar acceleration over time. This knowledge gap stems from the limited availability of time series data on biodiversity changes across large temporal and geographical extents. Here we use a dataset of repeated plant surveys from 302 mountain summits across Europe, spanning 145 years of observation, to assess the temporal trajectory of mountain biodiversity changes as a globally coherent imprint of the Anthropocene. We find a continent-wide acceleration in the rate of increase in plant species richness, with five times as much species enrichment between 2007 and 2016 as fifty years ago, between 1957 and 1966. This acceleration is strikingly synchronized with accelerated global warming and is not linked to alternative global change drivers. The accelerating increases in species richness on mountain summits across this broad spatial extent demonstrate that acceleration in climate-induced biotic change is occurring even in remote places on Earth, with potentially far-ranging consequences not only for biodiversity, but also for ecosystem functioning and services."
"The light-harvesting 1-reaction centre (LH1-RC) complex is a key functional component of bacterial photosynthesis. Here we present a 2.9?Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bacteriochlorophyll b-based LH1-RC complex from Blastochloris viridis that reveals the structural basis for absorption of infrared light and the molecular mechanism of quinone migration across the LH1 complex. The triple-ring LH1 complex comprises a circular array of 17 ?-polypeptides sandwiched between 17 ?- and 16 ?-polypeptides. Tight packing of the ?-apoproteins between ?-polypeptides collectively interlocks and stabilizes the LH1 structure; this, together with the short Mg-Mg distances of bacteriochlorophyll b pairs, contributes to the large redshift of bacteriochlorophyll b absorption. The 'missing' 17th ?-polypeptide creates a pore in the LH1 ring, and an adjacent binding pocket provides a folding template for a quinone, QP, which adopts a compact, export-ready conformation before passage through the pore and eventual diffusion to the cytochrome bc1complex."
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammatory-demyelinating events in the central nervous system. Despite more than 40 years of MS research its aetiology remains unknown. This study aims to identify the most frequently reported and consistently regulated molecules in MS in order to generate molecular interaction networks and thereby leading to the identification of deregulated processes and pathways which could give an insight of the underlying molecular mechanisms of MS. Driven by an integrative systems biology approach, gene-expression profiling datasets were combined and stratified into ""Non-treated"" and ""Treated"" groups and additionally compared to other disease patterns. Molecular identifiers from dataset comparisons were matched to our Multiple Sclerosis database (MuScle; www.padb.org/muscle ). From 5079 statistically significant molecules, correlation analysis within groups identified a panel of 16 high-confidence genes unique to the naïve MS phenotype, whereas the ""Treated"" group reflected a common pattern associated with autoimmune disease. Pathway and gene-ontology clustering identified the Interferon gamma signalling pathway as the most relevant amongst all significant molecules, and viral infections as the most likely cause of all down-stream events observed. This hypothesis-free approach revealed the most significant molecular events amongst different MS phenotypes which can be used for further detailed studies."
"The foregut endoderm gives rise to several organs including liver, pancreas, lung and thyroid with important roles in human physiology. Understanding which genes and signalling pathways regulate their development is crucial for understanding developmental disorders as well as diseases in adulthood. We exploited unique advantages of the zebrafish model to develop a rapid and scalable CRISPR/Cas-based mutagenesis strategy aiming at the identification of genes involved in morphogenesis and function of the thyroid. Core elements of the mutagenesis assay comprise bi-allelic gene invalidation in somatic mutants, a non-invasive monitoring of thyroid development in live transgenic fish, complementary analyses of thyroid function in fixed specimens and quantitative analyses of mutagenesis efficiency by Illumina sequencing of individual fish. We successfully validated our mutagenesis-phenotyping strategy in experiments targeting genes with known functions in early thyroid morphogenesis (pax2a, nkx2.4b) and thyroid functional differentiation (duox, duoxa, tshr). We also demonstrate that duox and duoxa crispants phenocopy thyroid phenotypes previously observed in human patients with bi-allelic DUOX2 and DUOXA2 mutations. The proposed combination of efficient mutagenesis protocols, rapid non-invasive phenotyping and sensitive genotyping holds great potential to systematically characterize the function of larger candidate gene panels during thyroid development and is applicable to other organs and tissues."
"Inflammation is an established contributor to disease and the NLRP3 inflammasome is emerging as a potential therapeutic target. A number of small molecule inhibitors of the NLRP3 pathway have been described. Here we analysed the most promising of these inhibitor classes side by side to assess relative potency and selectivity for their respective putative targets. Assessed using ASC inflammasome-speck formation, and release of IL-1?, in both human monocyte/macrophage THP1 cells and in primary mouse microglia, we compared the relative potency and selectivity of P2X7 inhibitors, inflammasome inhibitors (diarylsulfonylurea vs. the NBC series), and caspase-1 inhibitors. In doing so we are now able to provide a well characterised small molecule tool kit for interrogating and validating inflammasome-dependent responses with a range of nanomolar potency inhibitors against established points in the inflammasome pathway."
"Cardiomyopathy is one of the characteristic features of cancer. In this study, we establish a suitable model to study breast cancer-induced cardiomyopathy in mice. We used Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma cells to induce subcutaneous tumor in 129/SvJ mice and studied its effect on heart function. In Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma bearing mice, we found significant reduction in left ventricle wall thickness, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening increase in left ventricle internal diameter. We found higher muscle atrophy, degeneration, fibrosis, expression of cell-adhesion molecules and cell death in tumor-bearing mice hearts. As observed in cancer patients, we found that mTOR, a key signalling molecule responsible for maintaining cell growth and autophagy was suppressed in this model. Tumor bearing mice hearts show increased expression and nuclear localization of TFEB and FoxO3a transcription factors, which are involved in the upregulation of muscle atrophy genes, lysosomal biogenesis genes and autophagy genes. We propose that Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma induced tumor can be used as a model to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of heart failure in patients suffering from cancer-induced cardiomyopathy. This model can also be used to test the adverse consequences of cancer chemotherapy in heart."
"Diatoms are unicellular algae playing a key role as photosynthetic organisms in the world's ocean food webs. The chemical ecology of planktonic diatoms is well documented, but few studies have reported on the effects of benthic diatoms on their consumers, also due to difficulties in the collection, quantification and massive culturing of benthic species. Here for the first time we investigate the effects of feeding on two abundantly occurring benthic diatoms, Nanofrustulum shiloi and Cylindrotheca closterium, isolated from the leaves of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, on the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Adult P. lividus were fed for one month on diets of either one of the two diatoms and on the green alga Ulva rigida, used as a feeding control. By combining morphological, metabolomic and de novo transcriptomic approaches, we demonstrate toxigenic effect on embryos generated by females fed with these benthic diatoms. Furthermore, chemical analysis reveal the presence of polyunsaturated aldehydes only for N. shiloi, and a high production of other oxylipins (cytotoxic compounds on their grazers and on cancer cell lines) for both diatoms, including some additional peaks not correlated to the canonic oxylipins commonly observed in planktonic diatoms. These findings open new perspectives in the study of diatom secondary metabolites influencing their grazers."
"Although transcription factors regulating endothelial cell (EC)-specific gene expression have been identified, it is not known how those factors induce EC-specificity. We previously reported that DNA hypomethylation of the proximal promoter elicits EC-specific expression of Roundabout4 (Robo4). However, the mechanisms establishing EC-specific hypomethylation of the Robo4 promoter remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the hypermethylated Robo4 proximal promoter is demethylated as human iPS cells differentiate into endothelial cells. Reporter assays demonstrated that ETV2, an ETS family transcription factor, bound to ETS motifs in the proximal promoter and activated Robo4 expression. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated direct interaction between ETV2 and methylcytosine-converting enzymes TET1 and TET2. Adenoviral expression of ETV2-TET1/TET2 complexes demethylated the Robo4 promoter and induced Robo4 expression in non-ECs. In summary, we propose a novel regulatory model of EC-specific gene expression via promoter demethylation induced by ETV2-TET1/TET2 complexes during endothelial differentiation."
"Macrophages are crucial for a successful pregnancy, and malfunctions of decidual macrophages correlate with adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion and preeclampsia. Previously, decidual macrophages were often thought to be a single population. In the present study, we identified three decidual macrophage subsets, CCR2-CD11cLO (CD11clow, ~80%), CCR2-CD11cHI (CD11chigh, ~5%), and CCR2+CD11cHI (CD11chigh, 10-15%), during the first trimester of human pregnancy by flow cytometry analysis. CCR2-CD11cLO macrophages are widely distributed in the decidua, while CCR2-CD11cHI and CCR2+CD11cHI macrophages are primarily detected close to extravillous trophoblast cells according to immunofluorescence staining. According to RNA sequencing bioinformatics analysis and in vitro functional studies, these three subsets of macrophages have different phagocytic capacities. CCR2+CD11cHI macrophages have pro-inflammatory characteristics, while the CCR2-CD11cHI population is suggested to be anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory due to its high expression of critical heme metabolism-related genes, suggesting that these two subsets of macrophages maintain an inflammatory balance at the leading edge of trophoblast invasion to facilitate the clearance of pathogen infection as well as maintain the homeostasis of the maternal-fetal interface. The present study physiologically identifies three decidual macrophage subsets. Further clarification of the functions of these subsets will improve our understanding of maternal-fetal crosstalk in the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy."
"The effects of chronic exposure to common acaricides on Apis mellifera survival, developmental rate and larval weight were tested in the laboratory. Larvae were reared in vitro and fed a diet containing amitraz: 1.5, 11, 25 and 46?mg/L; coumaphos: 1.8, 6, 8 and 25?mg/L; or fluvalinate: 0.1, 1, 2.4 and 6?mg/L. The dependent variables were compared for groups feeding on treated diets and control diets: positive control, 45?mg/L dimethoate; solvent control; and negative control. Bee survival decreased in the 46?mg/L amitraz and 25?mg/L coumaphos treatments but not in any fluvalinate treatment. Furthermore, the developmental rate decreased in individuals treated with 46?mg/L amitraz. In our study, larvae exposed to acaricides at concentrations similar to maximum residue in pollen and honey/nectar had no detectable change in survival or developmental rate. Given that pollen and honey/nectar represent only a small part of larval diet, we suggest that residues of amitraz, coumaphos and fluvalinate at the levels we tested are unlikely to impact immature worker bee survival in the field, though our data do not preclude any sublethal effects that may result from bee exposure to these compounds or possible synergisms when they co-occur in bee colonies."
"Alnus cremastogyne, a broad-leaved tree endemic to south-western China, has both commercial and restoration importance. However, little is known of its morphological, physiological and biochemical responses to drought and phosphorous (P) application. A randomized experimental design was used to investigate how drought affected A. cremastogyne seedlings, and the role that P applications play in these responses. Drought had significant negative effects on A. cremastogyne growth and metabolism, as revealed by reduced biomass (leaf, shoot and root), leaf area, stem diameter, plant height, photosynthetic rate, leaf relative water content, and photosynthetic pigments, and a weakened antioxidative defence mechanism and high lipid peroxidation level. However, the reduced leaf area and enhanced osmolyte (proline and soluble sugars) accumulation suggests drought avoidance and tolerance strategies in this tree. Applying P significantly improved the leaf relative water content and photosynthetic rate of drought-stressed seedlings, which may reflect increased anti-oxidative enzyme (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase) activities, osmolyte accumulation, soluble proteins, and decreased lipid peroxidation levels. However, P had only a slight or negligible effect on the well-watered plants. A. cremastogyne is sensitive to drought stress, but P facilitates and improves its metabolism primarily via biochemical and physiological rather than morphological adjustments, regardless of water availability."
"Climate change affects ecosystem functioning directly through impacts on plant physiology, resulting in changes of global productivity. However, climate change has also an indirect impact on ecosystems, through changes in the composition and diversity of plant communities. The relative importance of these direct and indirect effects has not been evaluated within a same generic approach yet. Here we took advantage of a novel approach for disentangling these two effects in European temperate forests across a large climatic gradient, through a large simulation-based study using a forest succession model. We first showed that if productivity positively correlates with realized tree species richness under a changed climate, indirect effects appear pivotal to understand the magnitude of climate change impacts on forest productivity. We further detailed how warmer and drier conditions may affect the diversity-productivity relationships (DPRs) of temperate forests in the long term, mostly through effects on species recruitment, ultimately enhancing or preventing complementarity in resource use. Furthermore, losing key species reduced the strength of DPRs more severely in environments that are becoming climatically harsher. By disentangling direct and indirect effects of climate change on ecosystem functioning, these findings explain why high-diversity forests are expected to be more resilient to climate change."
"Anopheles gambiae coluzzii (An. coluzzii) uses olfaction to modulate a range of critical behaviors that are essential for survival and reproduction; most notably, host preference and selection underlie its vectorial capacity for human malaria. As is the case for all mosquitoes, An. coluzzii has three specialized peripheral olfactory appendages-the antennae, maxillary palps and labella-which are used to detect and orient in response to a large variety of olfactory cues. Of these, neither the molecular nor the physiological significance of the labellum have been thoroughly characterized despite suggestions that labial-derived odorant reception is critical for close-range host attraction. Here we report global chemoreceptor transcriptome profiles together with a systematic electrophysiological analysis of labial T2 sensilla, and associated behavioral responses of female An. coluzzii. Single sensillum recordings of the T2 sensilla revealed robust responses to odorants previously associated with human sweat and oviposition sites and identified a 10-component blend that elicited attraction in a dual-choice landing bioassay designed to mimic host seeking in which non-blood fed females were significantly more attracted to the labial-responsive odorant blend as compared to gravid females. Taken together, these data suggest that, in An. coluzzii, olfactory responses derived from the labellum contribute to host-seeking."
"In humans the expression of lactase changes during post-natal development, leading to phenotypes known as lactase persistence and non-persistence. Polymorphisms within the lactase gene (LCT) enhancer, in particular the -13910C?>?T, but also others, are linked to these phenotypes. We were interested in identifying dynamic mediators of LCT regulation, beyond the genotype at -13910C?>?T. To this end, we investigated two levels of lactase regulation in human intestinal samples obtained from New England children and adolescents of mixed European ancestry: differential expression of transcriptional regulators of LCT, and variations in DNA methylation, and their relation to phenotype. Variations in expression of CDX2, POU2F1, GATA4, GATA6, and HNF1? did not correlate with phenotype. However, an epigenome-wide approach using the Illumina Infinium HM450 bead chip identified a differentially methylated position in the LCT promoter where methylation levels are associated with the genotype at -13910C?>?T, the persistence/non-persistence phenotype and lactase enzymatic activity. DNA methylation levels at this promoter site and CpGs in the LCT enhancer are associated with genotype. Indeed, taken together they have a higher power to predict lactase phenotypes than the genotype alone."
"Early life stress (ELS) shapes the way individuals cope with future situations. Animals use cognitive flexibility to cope with their ever-changing environment and this is mainly processed in forebrain areas. We investigated the performance of juvenile gilthead seabream, previously subjected to an ELS regime. ELS fish showed overall higher brain catecholaminergic (CA) signalling and lower brain derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) and higher cfos expression in region-specific areas. All fish showed a normal cortisol and serotonergic response to acute stress. Brain dopaminergic activity and the expression of the ?2?adrenergic receptor were overall higher in the fish homologue to the lateral septum (Vv), suggesting that the Vv is important in CA system regulation. Interestingly, ELS prevented post-acute stress downregulation of the ?2?receptor in the amygdala homologue (Dm3). There was a lack of post-stress response in the ?2adrenergic receptor expression and a downregulation in bdnf in the Dm3 of ELS fish, which together indicate an allostatic overload in their stress coping ability. ELS fish showed higher neuronal activity (cfos) post-acute stress in the hippocampus homologue (Dlv) and the Dm3. Our results show clear long-term effects on limbic systems of seabream that may compromise their future coping ability to environmental challenges."
"The unicellular green alga Haematococcus pluvialis accumulates large amounts of the red ketocarotenoid astaxanthin to protect against environmental stresses. Haematococcus cells that accumulate astaxanthin in the central part (green-red cyst cells) respond rapidly to intense light by distributing astaxanthin diffusively to the peripheral part of the cell within 10?min after irradiation. This response is reversible: when astaxanthin-diffused cells were placed in the dark, astaxanthin was redistributed to the center of the cell. Although Haematococcus possesses several pigments other that astaxanthin, the subcellular distribution and content of each pigment remain unknown. Here, we analyzed the subcellular dynamics and localization of major pigments such as astaxanthin, ?-carotene, lutein, and chlorophylls under light irradiation using time-lapse and label-free hyperspectral imaging analysis. Fluorescence microscopy and freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy showed that, preceding/following exposure to light, astaxanthin colocalized with lipid droplets, which moved from the center to the periphery through pathways in a chloroplast. This study revealed that photoresponse dynamics differed between astaxanthin and other pigments (chlorophylls, lutein, and ?-carotene), and that only astaxanthin freely migrates from the center to the periphery of the cell through a large, spherical, cytoplasm-encapsulating chloroplast as a lipid droplet. We consider this to be the Haematococcus light-protection mechanism."
"High-coverage whole-genome sequencing data of a single ethnicity can provide a useful catalogue of population-specific genetic variations, and provides a critical resource that can be used to more accurately identify pathogenic genetic variants. We report a comprehensive analysis of the Korean population, and present the Korean National Standard Reference Variome (KoVariome). As a part of the Korean Personal Genome Project (KPGP), we constructed the KoVariome database using 5.5 terabases of whole genome sequence data from 50 healthy Korean individuals in order to characterize the benign ethnicity-relevant genetic variation present in the Korean population. In total, KoVariome includes 12.7M single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 1.7M short insertions and deletions (indels), 4K structural variations (SVs), and 3.6K copy number variations (CNVs). Among them, 2.4M (19%) SNVs and 0.4M (24%) indels were identified as novel. We also discovered selective enrichment of 3.8M SNVs and 0.5M indels in Korean individuals, which were used to filter out 1,271 coding-SNVs not originally removed from the 1,000 Genomes Project when prioritizing disease-causing variants. KoVariome health records were used to identify novel disease-causing variants in the Korean population, demonstrating the value of high-quality ethnic variation databases for the accurate interpretation of individual genomes and the precise characterization of genetic variations."
"The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a highly conserved multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls mitotic division in eukaryotic cells by tagging cell cycle regulators for proteolysis. APC3 is a key component that contributes to APC/C function. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, undergoes atypical mitotic division during its life cycle. Only a small subset of APC/C components has been identified in Plasmodium and their involvement in atypical cell division is not well understood. Here, using reverse genetics we examined the localisation and function of APC3 in Plasmodium berghei. APC3 was observed as a single focus that co-localised with the centriolar plaque during asexual cell division in schizonts, whereas it appeared as multiple foci in male gametocytes. Functional studies using gene disruption and conditional knockdown revealed essential roles of APC3 during these mitotic stages with loss resulting in a lack of chromosome condensation, abnormal cytokinesis and absence of microgamete formation. Overall, our data suggest that Plasmodium utilises unique cell cycle machinery to coordinate various processes during endomitosis, and this warrants further investigation in future studies."
"During acute-phase response (APR), there is a dramatic increase in serum amyloid A (SAA) in plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL). Elevated SAA leads to reactive AA amyloidosis in animals and humans. Herein, we employed apolipoprotein A-II (ApoA-II) deficient (Apoa2-/-) and transgenic (Apoa2Tg) mice to investigate the potential roles of ApoA-II in lipoprotein particle formation and progression of AA amyloidosis during APR. AA amyloid deposition was suppressed in Apoa2-/-mice compared with wild type (WT) mice. During APR, Apoa2-/-mice exhibited significant suppression of serum SAA levels and hepatic Saa1 and Saa2 mRNA levels. Pathological investigation showed Apoa2-/-mice had less tissue damage and less inflammatory cell infiltration during APR. Total lipoproteins were markedly decreased in Apoa2-/-mice, while the ratio of HDL to low density lipoprotein (LDL) was also decreased. Both WT and Apoa2-/-mice showed increases in LDL and very large HDL during APR. SAA was distributed more widely in lipoprotein particles ranging from chylomicrons to very small HDL in Apoa2-/-mice. Our observations uncovered the critical roles of ApoA-II in inflammation, serum lipoprotein stability and AA amyloidosis morbidity, and prompt consideration of therapies for AA and other amyloidoses, whose precursor proteins are associated with circulating HDL particles."
"In vertebrates, multiple transcription factors (TFs) bind to gene regulatory elements (promoters, enhancers, and silencers) to execute developmental expression changes. ChIP experiments are often used to identify where TFs bind to regulatory elements in the genome, but the requirement of TF-specific antibodies hampers analyses of tens of TFs at multiple loci. Here we tested whether TF binding predictions using ATAC-seq can be used to infer the identity of TFs that bind to functionally validated enhancers of the Cd4, Cd8, and Gata3 genes in thymocytes. We performed ATAC-seq at four distinct stages of development in mouse thymus, probing the chromatin accessibility landscape in double negative (DN), double positive (DP), CD4 single positive (SP4) and CD8 SP (SP8) thymocytes. Integration of chromatin accessibility with TF motifs genome-wide allowed us to infer stage-specific occupied TF binding sites within known and potentially novel regulatory elements. Our results provide genome-wide stage-specific T cell open chromatin profiles, and allow the identification of candidate TFs that drive thymocyte differentiation at each developmental stage."
"The persistent public health threat of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) highlights the need for an effective and safe MERS-CoV vaccine. In this study, we prepared and vaccinated mice with either a Spike (S) protein or inactivated whole MERS-CoV (IV) with a combined adjuvant (alum+CpG) as a vaccine formulation. Similar levels of the anti-S protein IgG response and neutralizing activity were induced by both the S protein and IV vaccines. In addition, immune responses against three other structural proteins, the envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, were also detected in sera of mice that received IV. No antigen-specific T-cell immunity was detected after vaccination based on the interferon-? ELISpot assay. Mice were transduced with Ad5-hDPP4 after the final immunization and were then challenged with MERS-CoV (1?×?105plaque-forming units). Compared with the control group (adjuvant alone), mice immunized with the S protein or IV showed slightly lower pathological damage in the lung, as well as reduced antigen expression and lung virus titers. Mice that received IV formulations also showed increased protective immunity (almost no live virus was isolated from the lung). In conclusion, our data indicate that immunization with our IV formulation induced enhanced protection in mice compared to immunization with the S protein against MERS-CoV, which should be further tested in camels and clinical trials."
"Heart transplantation (HT) is a well-established lifesaving treatment for endstage cardiac failure. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) represents one of the main problems after HT because of its diagnostic complexity and the poor evidence for supporting treatments. Complement cascade and B-cells play a key role in AMR and contribute to graft damage. This study explored the importance of variants in genes related to complement pathway and B-cell biology in HT and AMR in donors and in donor-recipient pairs.Methods?and?Results:Genetic variants in 112 genes (51 complement and 61 B-cell biology genes) were analyzed on next-generation sequencing in 28 donor-recipient pairs, 14 recipients with and 14 recipients without AMR. Statistical analysis was performed with SNPStats, R, and EPIDAT3.1. We identified one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in donors in genes related to B-cell biology,interleukin-4 receptor subunit? (p.Ile75Val-IL4R?), which correlated with the development of AMR. Moreover, in the analysis of recipient-donor genotype discrepancies, we identified another SNP, in this case inadenosine deaminase(ADA; p.Val178(p=)), which was related to B-cell biology, associated with the absence of AMR.Donor polymorphisms and recipient-donor discrepancies in genes related to the biology of B-cells, could have an important role in the development of AMR. In contrast, no variants in donor or in donor-recipient pairs in complement pathways seem to have an impact on AMR."
"It has previously been demonstrated that apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1) binding protein (AIBP) promotes apoA-1 binding to ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and prevents ABCA1 protein degradation so as to inhibit foam cell formation. Because apoA-1 inhibits inflammatory signaling pathways, whether AIBP has an inhibitory effect on inflammatory signaling pathways in THP-1-derived macrophages is investigated.Methods?and?Results:Analysis of inflammation-related gene expression indicated that AIBP decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated macrophage inflammation. AIBP significantly prevented NF-?B nuclear translocation. Further, AIBP prevented the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38 MAPK, extracellular-signal regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. AIBP decreased MyD88 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, but did not have any effect on TLR4 expression. Moreover, treatment with both AIBP and apoA-1 decreased the abundance of TLR4 in the lipid raft fraction. AIBP lacking 115-123 amino acids (?115-123), however, did not have such effects as described for intact AIBP. In addition, knockdown of ABCA1 inhibited the effects of AIBP on inflammatory factor secretion.These results suggest that AIBP inhibits inflammatory signaling pathways through binding to apoA-1 and stabilizing ABCA1, and subsequent alteration of lipid rafts and TLR4 in the cell membrane."
"Six triterpenic acids were separated and purified from the ethyl acetate extractive fraction of ethanol extracts of Potentilla parvifolia Fisch. using a variety of chromatographic methods. The neuroprotective effects of these triterpenoids were investigated in the present study, in which the okadaic acid induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were used as an Alzheimer's disease cell model in vitro. The cell model was established with all trans-retinoic acid (5 ?mol/L, 4 days) and okadaic acid (40 nmol/L, 6 hours) treatments to induce tau phosphorylation and synaptic atrophy. Subsequently, the neuroprotective effects of these triterpenic acids were evaluated in vitro by this cell model. Results from the western blot and morphology analysis suggested that compounds 3~6 had the better neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, we tested the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential of these compounds in SH-SY5Y cells by flow cytometry technology to investigate the potential neuroprotective mechanism of these compounds. All of the results indicated that maybe the mechanism of compounds 5 and 6 is to protect the cell from mitochondrial oxidative stress injuries."
"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most frequently diagnosed congenital immunodeficiency and is characterized by dysfunctional antibody production. It often occurs at the age of ?10 years. Here we reported a case of a 46-year-old man confirmed with adult-onset CVID. He was effectively treated with cord blood transplant (CBT). The patient was observed with repeated upper respiratory infection a few years back and was referred to our department owing to a marked decrease in neutrophil counts and progression of anemia. Laboratory tests confirmed hypogammaglobulinemia, but no autoantibodies were detected. Bone marrow aspiration showed a hypocellular marrow with predominantly mature lymphocytes. T-cell receptor excision circle assay revealed a reduction in T-cell neogenesis. Further, multicolor flow cytometry analysis revealed a low differentiation of B cells; subsequently, CVID was confirmed in the patient. The patient had a severe clinical course and therefore, received CBT for the treatment. After the transplantation, the hematopoiesis was restored and the serum immunoglobulin levels returned to normal. The patient exhibited a favorable clinical course. Nevertheless, there is no precise definition to establish the disease concept of CVID. Also, most of the potential cases are predominantly reported in adults. Therefore, further data on cases with CVID should be accumulated to establish the diagnostic criteria as well as treatment modalities."
"Macrophage aging is pathogenic in diseases of the elderly, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness in older adults. However, the role of microRNAs, which modulate immune processes, in regulating macrophage dysfunction and thereby promoting age-associated diseases is underexplored. Here, we report that microRNA-150 (miR-150) coordinates transcriptomic changes in aged murine macrophages, especially those associated with aberrant lipid trafficking and metabolism in AMD pathogenesis. Molecular profiling confirmed that aged murine macrophages exhibit dysregulated ceramide and phospholipid profiles compared with young macrophages. Of translational relevance, upregulation of miR-150 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also significantly associated with increased odds of AMD, even after controlling for age. Mechanistically, miR-150 directly targets stearoyl-CoA desaturase-2, which coordinates macrophage-mediated inflammation and pathologic angiogenesis, as seen in AMD, in a VEGF-independent manner. Together, our results implicate miR-150 as pathogenic in AMD and provide potentially novel molecular insights into diseases of aging."
"Extracellular RNA (exRNA) has emerged as an important transducer of intercellular communication. Advancing exRNA research promises to revolutionize biology and transform clinical practice. Recent efforts have led to cutting-edge research and expanded knowledge of this new paradigm in cell-to-cell crosstalk; however, gaps in our understanding of EV heterogeneity and exRNA diversity pose significant challenges for continued development of exRNA diagnostics and therapeutics. To unravel this complexity, the NIH convened expert teams to discuss the current state of the science, define the significant bottlenecks, and brainstorm potential solutions across the entire exRNA research field. The NIH Strategic Workshop on Extracellular RNA Transport helped identify mechanistic and clinical research opportunities for exRNA biology and provided recommendations on high priority areas of research that will advance the exRNA field."
"We generated a comprehensive atlas of the immunologic cellular networks within human malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) using mass cytometry. Data-driven analyses of these high-resolution single-cell data identified 2 distinct immunologic subtypes of MPM with vastly different cellular composition, activation states, and immunologic function; mass spectrometry demonstrated differential abundance of MHC-I and -II neopeptides directly identified between these subtypes. The clinical relevance of this immunologic subtyping was investigated with a discriminatory molecular signature derived through comparison of the proteomes and transcriptomes of these 2 immunologic MPM subtypes. This molecular signature, representative of a favorable intratumoral cell network, was independently associated with improved survival in MPM and predicted response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with MPM and melanoma. These data additionally suggest a potentially novel mechanism of response to checkpoint blockade: requirement for high measured abundance of neopeptides in the presence of high expression of MHC proteins specific for these neopeptides."
"The effect of gene expression data on diagnosis remains limited. Here, we show how diagnosis and classification of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) can be achieved from a single blood sample using a combination of transcriptomics and random forest analysis.Prepubertal treatment-naive children with GHD (n = 98) were enrolled from the PREDICT study, and controls (n = 26) were acquired from online data sets. Whole blood gene expression was correlated with peak growth hormone (GH) using rank regression and a random forest algorithm tested for prediction of the presence of GHD and in classification of GHD as severe (peak GH <4 ?g/l) and nonsevere (peak ?4 ?g/l). Performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).Rank regression identified 347 probe sets in which gene expression correlated with peak GH concentrations (r = ± 0.28, P < 0.01). These 347 probe sets yielded an AUC-ROC of 0.95 for prediction of GHD status versus controls and an AUC-ROC of 0.93 for prediction of GHD severity.This study demonstrates highly accurate diagnosis and disease classification for GHD using a combination of transcriptomics and random forest analysis.NCT00256126 and NCT00699855.Merck and the National Institute for Health Research (CL-2012-06-005)."
"Tumor-induced expansion of Tregs is a significant obstacle to cancer immunotherapy. However, traditional approaches to deplete Tregs are often inefficient, provoking autoimmunity. We show here that administration of IL-27-expressing recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV-IL-27) significantly inhibits tumor growth and enhances T cell responses in tumors. Strikingly, we found that AAV-IL-27 treatment causes rapid depletion of Tregs in peripheral blood, lymphoid organs, and - most pronouncedly - tumor microenvironment. AAV-IL-27-mediated Treg depletion is dependent on IL-27 receptor and Stat1 in Tregs and is a combined result of CD25 downregulation in Tregs and inhibition of IL-2 production by T cells. In combination with a GM-CSF vaccine, AAV-IL-27 treatment not only induced nearly complete tumor rejection, but also resulted in amplified neoantigen-specific T cell responses. AAV-IL-27 also dramatically increased the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, presumably due to induction of PD-L1 in T cells and depletion of Tregs. Importantly, AAV-IL-27 therapy did not induce significant adverse events, partially due to its induction of IL-10. In a plasmacytoma mouse model, we found that IL-10 was required for AAV-IL-27-mediated tumor rejection. Thus, our study demonstrates the potential of AAV-IL-27 as an independent cancer therapeutic and as an efficient adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy."
"Replication competent HIV-1 persists in a subpopulation of CD4+ T lymphocytes despite prolonged antiretroviral treatment. This residual reservoir of infected cells harbors transcriptionally silent provirus capable of reigniting productive infection upon discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy. Certain classes of drugs can activate latent virus but not at levels that lead to reductions in HIV-1 reservoir size in vivo. Here, we show the utility of CD4+ receptor targeting exosomes as an HIV-1 latency reversal agent (LRA). We engineered human cellular exosomes to express HIV-1 Tat, a protein that is a potent transactivator of viral transcription. Preparations of exosomal Tat-activated HIV-1 in primary, resting CD4+ T lymphocytes isolated from antiretroviral-treated individuals with prolonged periods of viral suppression and led to the production of replication competent HIV-1. Furthermore, exosomal Tat increased the potency of selected LRA by over 30-fold in terms of HIV-1 mRNA expression, thereby establishing it as a potentially new class of biologic product with possible combinatorial utility in targeting latent HIV-1."
"Secondary bacterial respiratory infections are commonly associated with both acute and chronic lung injury. Influenza complicated by bacterial pneumonia is an effective model to study host defense during pulmonary superinfection due to its clinical relevance. Multiprotein inflammasomes are responsible for IL-1? production in response to infection and drive tissue inflammation. In this study, we examined the role of the inflammasome during viral/bacterial superinfection. We demonstrate that ASC-/- mice are protected from bacterial superinfection and produce sufficient quantities of IL-1? through an apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) inflammasome-independent mechanism. Despite the production of IL-1? by ASC-/- mice in response to bacterial superinfection, these mice display decreased lung inflammation. A neutrophil elastase inhibitor blocked ASC inflammasome-independent production of IL-1? and the IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, confirmed that IL-1 remains crucial to the clearance of bacteria during superinfection. Delayed inhibition of NLRP3 during influenza infection by MCC950 decreases bacterial burden during superinfection and leads to decreased inflammatory cytokine production. Collectively, our results demonstrate that ASC augments the clearance of bacteria, but can also contribute to inflammation and mortality. ASC should be considered as a therapeutic target to decrease morbidity and mortality during bacterial superinfection."
"Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a significant clinical problem with incompletely resolved mechanisms. Here, the secreted metalloproteinases ADAMTS7 and ADAMTS12 are shown to comprise a unique proteoglycan class that protects against a tendency toward HO in mouse hindlimb tendons, menisci, and ligaments. Adamts7 and Adamts12 mRNAs were sparsely expressed in murine forelimbs but strongly coexpressed in hindlimb tendons, skeletal muscle, ligaments, and meniscal fibrocartilage. Adamts7-/- Adamts12-/- mice, but not corresponding single-gene mutants, which demonstrated compensatory upregulation of the intact homolog mRNA, developed progressive HO in these tissues after 4 months of age. Adamts7-/- Adamts12-/- tendons had abnormal collagen fibrils, accompanied by reduced levels of the small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) biglycan, fibromodulin, and decorin, which regulate collagen fibrillogenesis. Bgn-/0 Fmod-/- mice are known to have a strikingly similar hindlimb HO to that of Adamts7-/- Adamts12-/- mice, implicating fibromodulin and biglycan reduction as a likely mechanism underlying HO in Adamts7-/- Adamts12-/- mice. Interestingly, degenerated human biceps tendons had reduced ADAMTS7 mRNA compared with healthy biceps tendons, which expressed both ADAMTS7 and ADAMTS12. These results suggest that ADAMTS7 and ADAMTS12 drive an innate pathway protective against hindlimb HO in mice and may be essential for human tendon health."
"Several members of the APOBEC3 DNA cytosine deaminase family can potently inhibit Vif-deficient HIV-1 by catalyzing cytosine deamination in viral cDNA and impeding reverse transcription. HIV-1 counteracts restriction with the virally encoded Vif protein, which targets relevant APOBEC3 proteins for proteasomal degradation. HIV-1 Vif is optimized for degrading the restrictive human APOBEC3 repertoire and, in general, lentiviral Vif proteins specifically target the restricting APOBEC3 enzymes of each host species. However, SIVmac239Vif elicits a curiously wide range of APOBEC3 degradation capabilities that include several human APOBEC3s and even human APOBEC3B, a non-HIV-1 restricting APOBEC3 enzyme. To better understand the molecular determinants of the interaction between SIVmac239Vif and human APOBEC3B, we analyzed an extensive series of mutants. We found that SIVmac239Vif interacts with the N-terminal domain of human APOBEC3B and, interestingly, that this occurs within a structural region homologous to the HIV-1 Vif interaction surface of human APOBEC3G. An alanine scan of SIVmac239Vif revealed several residues required for human APOBEC3B degradation activity. These residues overlap with HIV-1 Vif surface residues that interact with human APOBEC3G, and are distinct from those that engage APOBEC3F or APOBEC3H. Overall, these studies indicate that the molecular determinants of the functional interaction between human APOBEC3B and SIVmac239Vif resemble those between human APOBEC3G and HIV-1 Vif. These studies contribute to growing knowledge of the APOBEC-Vif interaction and may help guide future efforts to disrupt this interaction as an antiviral therapy or exploit the interaction as a novel strategy to inhibit APOBEC3B-dependent tumor evolution.IMPORTANCEPrimate APOBEC3 proteins provide innate immunity against retroviruses such as HIV and SIV. HIV-1, the primary cause of AIDS, utilizes its Vif protein to specifically counteract restrictive human APOBEC3 enzymes. SIVmac239Vif exhibits a much wider range of anti-APOBEC3 activities that includes several rhesus macaque enzymes and extends to multiple proteins in the human APOBEC3 repertoire including APOBEC3B. Understanding the molecular determinants of the interaction between SIVmac239Vif and human APOBEC3B adds to existing knowledge on the APOBEC3-Vif interaction and has potential to shed light on what processes may have shaped Vif functionality over evolutionary time. An intimate understanding of this interaction may also lead to a novel cancer therapy because, for instance, creating a derivative of SIVmac239Vif that specifically targets human APOBEC3B could be used to suppress tumor genomic DNA mutagenesis by this enzyme, slow ongoing tumor evolution, and help prevent poor clinical outcomes."
"The pathogenesis of increased stroke risk in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains unclear. Our study investigated the relationship between adventitial and intimal CD3+ T cells and brain arterial remodeling that potentially contributes to HIV-related vasculopathy and stroke. Large brain arteries from 84 HIV+ cases and 78 HIV- cases were analyzed to determine interadventitial and luminal diameters, intimal and wall thickness, percentage stenosis, and presence of atherosclerosis. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect and visually score CD3, a pan T cell marker, in the intima and adventitia. Our study showed that adventitial CD3+ T cells are lower among persons with HIV, especially if CD4<200, though intimal CD3+ T cells did not differ by HIV status. Among those with HIV but CD4<200 at time of death, intimal CD3+ T cells were associated with hypertrophic outward remodeling, while among those with HIV and CD4>200 or HIV- controls, intimal CD3+ T cells were associated with hypertrophic inward remodeling. We conclude that intimal lymphocytic inflammation is involved in brain arterial remodeling that may contribute to HIV-related cerebrovascular pathology.IMPORTANCEAlthough mortality from Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has decreased with the use of combination antiretroviral therapies, there is now an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease associated with HIV. Thus, there is a need to understand the pathogenesis of stroke in HIV infection. Our study examines how lymphocytic inflammation in brain arteries may contribute to increased cerebral vasculopathy. With this understanding, our study can potentially help direct future therapies to target and prevent brain arterial remodeling processes associated with HIV."
"Herpesvirus membrane fusion depends on the core fusion machinery comprising glycoproteins (g)B and gH/gL. Although gB structurally resembles autonomous class III fusion proteins, it strictly depends on gH/gL to drive membrane fusion. Whether the gH/gL complex needs to be membrane-anchored to fulfill its function and which role the gH cytoplasmic (CD) and transmembrane domains (TMD) play in fusion is unclear. While the gH CD and TMD play an important role during infection, soluble gH/gL of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) seems to be sufficient to mediate cell-cell fusion in transient assays arguing against an essential contribution of the CD and TMD. To shed more light on this apparent discrepancy we investigated the role of the CD and TMD of the related alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus (PrV) gH. For this purpose, we expressed C-terminally truncated and soluble gH, and substituted the TMD by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchor. We also generated chimeras containing the TMD and/or CD of PrV gD or HSV-1 gH. Proteins were characterized in cell-based fusion assays and during virus infection. Although truncation of the CD resulted in decreased membrane fusion activity, the mutant proteins still supported replication of gH-negative PrV, indicating that the PrV gH CD is dispensable for viral replication. In contrast, PrV gH lacking the TMD, membrane-anchored via a lipid-linker, or comprising the PrV gD TMD were non-functional highlighting the essential role of the gH TMD for function. Interestingly, despite low sequence identity, the HSV-1 gH TMD could substitute for the PrV gH TMD pointing to functional conservation.IMPORTANCEEnveloped viruses depend on membrane fusion for virus entry. While this process can be mediated by only one or two proteins herpesviruses depend on the concerted action of at least three different glycoproteins. Although gB has features of bona-fide fusion proteins, it depends on gH and its complex partner gL for fusion. Whether gH/gL prevents premature fusion or actively triggers gB-mediated fusion is unclear and there are contradictory results on whether gH/gL function requires stable membrane anchorage or whether the ectodomains alone are sufficient. Our results show that in pseudorabies virus gH the transmembrane anchor plays an essential role for gB-mediated fusion while the cytoplasmic tail is not strictly required."

"In metazoa the Nup107-160 nucleoporin Y complex plays a major role in formation of the nuclear pore complex in interphase and is localised to kinetochores in mitosis. The Nup107-160 complex shares a single highly conserved subunit, Seh1, with the GATOR2 complex, an essential activator of mTORC1 kinase. mTORC1/GATOR2 has a central role in the coordination of cell growth and proliferation. Here we use chemical genetics and quantitative chromosome proteomics to study the role of the Seh1 protein in mitosis. Surprisingly, Seh1 is not required for the association of the Nup107-160 complex with mitotic chromosomes, but it is essential for the association of both GATOR2 complex and nucleoporin Nup153 with mitotic chromosomes. Our analysis also reveals a role for Seh1 at human centromeres, where it is required for efficient localisation of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). Furthermore this analysis detects a functional interaction between the Nup107-160 complex and the small kinetochore protein SKAP."
"                    Dictyostelium discoideum
cells transport adenylyl cyclase A (ACA) containing vesicles to the back of polarized cells to relay exogenous cAMP signals during chemotaxis. Fluorescencein situhybridization (FISH) experiments showed that ACA mRNA is also asymmetrically distributed at the back of polarized cells. Using the MS2 bacteriophage system, we now visualized the distribution of ACA mRNA in live chemotaxing cells. We found that the ACA mRNA localization is not dependent on the translation of the protein product and requires multiple cis-acting elements within the ACA coding sequence. We show that ACA mRNA is associated with actively translating ribosomes and is transported along microtubules towards the back of cells. By monitoring the recovery of ACA-YFP after photobleach we observed that local translation of ACA-YFP occurs at the back of cells. These data represent a novel functional role for localized translation in the relay of chemotactic signals during chemotaxis."
"To investigate the genetic basis of cisplatin resistance. Efficacy of cisplatin chemotherapy in the treatment of distinct malignancies is often hampered by intrinsic/ acquired drug resistance of tumors.We produced 14 orthoxenograft transplanting human nonseminomatous (NSE) testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) to mice, keeping the primary tumor features (genotype, phenotype and sensitivity to cisplatin). Chromosomal and genetic alterations were evaluated in matched cisplatin-sensitive and their counterpart orthoxenografts that developed resistance to cisplatin in vivo.Comparative genomic hybridization analyses of four matched orthoxenografts identified recurrent chromosomal rearrangements across cisplatin-resistant tumors in three of them, showing gains at 9q32-q33.1 region. We found a clinical correlation between the presence of 9q32-q33.1 gains in cisplatin refractory patients and poorer overall survival in metastatic TGCTs. We study the expression profile of the sixty genes located at that genomic region. POLE3 and AKNA were the only two genes deregulated in resistant tumors harboring the 9q32-q33.1 gain. Other four genes (GCS, ZNF883, CTR1 and FLJ31713) were deregulated in all five resistant tumors independently of the 9q32-q33.1 amplification. RT-PCRs in tumors and functional analyses in C. elegans indicate that the influence of 9q32-q33.1 genes in cisplatin resistance can be driven by either up- or down-regulation. We focused on glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) to demonstrate that the GCS inhibitor DL-threo-PDMP re-sensitizes cisplatin-resistant germline-derived orthoxenografts to cisplatin.Orthoxenografts can be used preclinically to test the efficiency of drugs and also to identify prognosis markers and gene alterations acting as drivers of the acquired cisplatin resistance."
"Homozygous deletions play important roles in carcinogenesis. The genome-wide screening for homozygously deleted genes in many different cancer types with a large number of patient specimens representing the tumor heterogeneity has not been done.We performed integrative analyses of the copy number profiles of 10,759 patients across 31 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas project.We found that the Type-I interferon, ?- and ?-defensin genes were homozygously deleted in 19 cancer types with high frequencies (7%-31%, median = 12%; interquartile range = 10-16.5%). Patients with homozygous deletion of interferons exhibited significantly shortened overall or disease-free survival time in a number of cancer types, whereas patients with homozygous deletion of defensins did not significantly associate with worse overall or disease-free survival. Gene expression analyses suggested that homozygous deletion of interferon and defensin genes could activate genes involved in oncogenic and cell cycle pathways but repress other genes involved in immune response pathways, suggesting their roles in promoting tumorigenesis and helping cancer cells evade immune surveillance. Further analysis of the whole exomes of 109 melanoma patients demonstrated that the homozygous deletion of interferon (P = 0.0029, OR = 11.8) and defensin (P = 0.06, OR = 2.79) genes are significantly associated with resistance to anti-CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated protein 4) immunotherapy.Our analysis reveals that the homozygous deletion of interferon and defensin genes are prevalent in human cancers, and importantly this feature can be used as a novel prognostic biomarker for immunotherapy resistance."

Vascular calcification (VC) is a marker of the severity of atherosclerotic disease. Hormones play important roles in regulating calcification; estrogen and parathyroid hormones exert opposing effects, the former alleviating VC and the latter exacerbating it. So far no treatment strategies have been developed to regulate clinical VC.
                        
                            Objective:
                        
                    To investigate the effect of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and its agonist (GHRH-A) on the blocking of VC in a mouse model.
                        
                            Methods and Results:
                        
                    Young adult osteoprotegerin deficient (OPG-/-) mice were given daily subcutaneous injections of GHRH-A (MR409) for 4 weeks. Significant reductions in calcification of the aortas of MR409 treated mice were paralleled by markedly lower alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and a dramatic reduction in the expression of transcription factors including the osteogenic marker gene Runx2 and its downstream factors, osteonectin and osteocalcin. The mechanism of action of GHRH-A was dissected in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from human and mouse aortas. Calcification of SMCs induced by osteogenic medium (OM) was inhibited in the presence of GHRH or MR409, as evidenced by reduced ALP activity and Runx2 expression. Inhibition of calcification by MR409 was partially reversed by MIA602, a GHRH antagonist, or a GHRH receptor selective siRNA. Treatment with MR409 induced elevated cytosolic cAMP and its target, protein kinase A (PKA) which in turn blocked NADPH oxidase activity and reduced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus blocking the phosphorylation of NF?B (p65), a key intermediate in the RANKL-Runx2/ALP osteogenesis program. A PKA-selective siRNA or the chemical inhibitor H89 abolished these beneficial effects of MR409.
                        
                            Conclusions:
                        
                    GHRH-A controls osteogenesis in SMCs by targeting cross talk between PKA and NF?B (p65) and through the suppression of ROS production that induces the Runx2 gene and ALP. Inflammation-mediated osteogenesis is thereby blocked. GHRH-A may represent a new pharmacological strategy to regulate VC."

Regulatory T (Treg) cells suppress immune responses and have been shown to attenuate atherosclerosis. The Treg cell lineage specification factor FOXP3 is essential for Treg cells' ability to uphold immunological tolerance. In humans, FOXP3 exists in several different isoforms, however, their specific role is poorly understood.
                        
                            Objective:
                        
                    To define the regulation and functions of the two major FOXP3 isoforms, FOXP3fl and FOXP3?2, as well as to establish whether their expression is associated with ischemic atherosclerotic disease.
                        
                            Methods and Results:
                        
                    Human primary T-cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding distinct FOXP3 isoforms. The phenotype and function of these cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, in vitro suppression assays and RNA-sequencing. We also assessed the effect of activation on Treg cells isolated from healthy volunteers. Treg cell activation resulted in increased FOXP3 expression that predominantly was made up of FOXP3?2. FOXP3?2 induced specific transcription of GARP, which functions by tethering the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-? to the cell membrane of activated Treg cells. RT-PCR was used to determine the impact of alternative splicing ofFOXP3in relation with atherosclerotic plaque stability in a cohort of over 150 patients that underwent carotid endarterectomy. Plaque instability was associated with a lowerFOXP3?2transcript usage, when comparing plaques from patients without symptoms and patients with occurrence of recent (<1 month) vascular symptoms including minor stoke, transient ischemic attack or amaurosis fugax. No difference was detected in total levels ofFOXP3mRNA between these two groups.
                        
                            Conclusions:
                        
                    These results suggest that activated Treg cells suppress the atherosclerotic disease process and that FOXP3?2 controls a transcriptional program that acts protectively in human atherosclerotic plaques."

"This FlyBook chapter summarizes the history and the current state of our understanding of the Wingless signaling pathway. Wingless, the fly homolog of the mammalian Wnt oncoproteins, plays a central role in pattern generation during development. Much of what we know about the pathway was learned from genetic and molecular experiments inDrosophila melanogaster, and the core pathway works the same way in vertebrates. Like most growth factor pathways, extracellular Wingless/Wnt binds to a cell surface complex to transduce signal across the plasma membrane, triggering a series of intracellular events that lead to transcriptional changes in the nucleus. Unlike most growth factor pathways, the intracellular events regulate the protein stability of a key effector molecule, in this case Armadillo/?-catenin. A number of mysteries remain about how the ""destruction complex"" destabilizes ?-catenin and how this process is inactivated by the ligand-bound receptor complex, so this review of the field can only serve as a snapshot of the work in progress."
"Understanding how activity patterns in specific neural circuits coordinate an animal's behavior remains a key area of neuroscience research.

"Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction and loss are a hallmark of non-neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NNAMD). Without the RPE, a majority of overlying photoreceptors ultimately degenerate, leading to severe, progressive vision loss. Clinical and histological studies suggest that RPE replacement strategies may delay disease progression or restore vision. A prospective, interventional, U.S. Food and Drug Administration-cleared, phase 1/2a study is being conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of a composite subretinal implant in subjects with advanced NNAMD. The composite implant, termed the California Project to Cure Blindness-Retinal Pigment Epithelium 1 (CPCB-RPE1), consists of a polarized monolayer of human embryonic stem cell-derived RPE (hESC-RPE) on an ultrathin, synthetic parylene substrate designed to mimic Bruch's membrane. We report an interim analysis of the phase 1 cohort consisting of five subjects. Four of five subjects enrolled in the study successfully received the composite implant. In all implanted subjects, optical coherence tomography imaging showed changes consistent with hESC-RPE and host photoreceptor integration. None of the implanted eyes showed progression of vision loss, one eye improved by 17 letters and two eyes demonstrated improved fixation. The concurrent structural and functional findings suggest that CPCB-RPE1 may improve visual function, at least in the short term, in some patients with severe vision loss from advanced NNAMD."
"Three adaptive hypotheses have been forwarded to explain the distinctive Neanderthal face: (i) an improved ability to accommodate high anterior bite forces, (ii) more effective conditioning of cold and/or dry air and, (iii) adaptation to facilitate greater ventilatory demands. We test these hypotheses using three-dimensional models of Neanderthals, modern humans, and a close outgroup (Homo heidelbergensis), applying finite-element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This is the most comprehensive application of either approach applied to date and the first to include both. FEA reveals few differences betweenH. heidelbergensis, modern humans, and Neanderthals in their capacities to sustain high anterior tooth loadings. CFD shows that the nasal cavities of Neanderthals and especially modern humans condition air more efficiently than does that ofH. heidelbergensis, suggesting that both evolved to better withstand cold and/or dry climates than less derivedHomoWe further find that Neanderthals could move considerably more air through the nasal pathway than couldH. heidelbergensisor modern humans, consistent with the propositions that, relative to our outgroupHomo, Neanderthal facial morphology evolved to reflect improved capacities to better condition cold, dry air, and, to move greater air volumes in response to higher energetic requirements."
"Why tropical forests harbour an exceptional number of species with striking differences in abundances remains an open question. We propose a theoretical framework to address this question in which rare species may have different extirpation risks depending on species ranks in tree growth and sensitivities to neighbourhood interactions. To evaluate the framework, we studied tree growth and its responses to neighbourhood dissimilarity (ND) in traits and phylogeny for 146 species in a neotropical forest. We found that tree growth was positively related to ND, and common species were more strongly affected by ND than rare species, which may help delay dominance of common species. Rare species grew more slowly at the community-wide average ND than common species. But rare species grew faster when common species tended to dominate locally, which may help reduce extirpation risk of rare species. Our study highlights that tree growth rank among species depends on their responses to neighbourhood interactions, which can be important in fostering diversity maintenance in tropical forests."
"Bats represent one of the largest and most striking nocturnal mammalian radiations, exhibiting many visual system specializations for performance in light-limited environments. Despite representing the greatest ecological diversity and species richness in Chiroptera, Neotropical lineages have been undersampled in molecular studies, limiting the potential for identifying signatures of selection on visual genes associated with differences in bat ecology. Here, we investigated how diverse ecological pressures mediate long-term shifts in selection upon long-wavelength (Lws) and short-wavelength (Sws1) opsins, photosensitive cone pigments that form the basis of colour vision in most mammals, including bats. We used codon-based likelihood clade models to test whether ecological variables associated with reliance on visual information (e.g. echolocation ability and diet) or exposure to varying light environments (e.g. roosting behaviour and foraging habitat) mediated shifts in evolutionary rates in bat cone opsin genes. Using additional cone opsin sequences from newly sequenced eye transcriptomes of six Neotropical bat species, we found significant evidence for different ecological pressures influencing the evolution of the cone opsins. WhileLwsis evolving under significantly lower constraint in highly specialized high-duty cycle echolocating lineages, which have enhanced sonar ability to detect and track targets, variation inSws1constraint was significantly associated with foraging habitat, exhibiting elevated rates of evolution in species that forage among vegetation. This suggests that increased reliance on echolocation as well as the spectral environment experienced by foraging bats may differentially influence the evolution of different cone opsins. Our study demonstrates that different ecological variables may underlie contrasting evolutionary patterns in bat visual opsins, and highlights the suitability of clade models for testing ecological hypotheses of visual evolution."
"Ecological networks are composed of interacting communities that influence ecosystem structure and function. Fungi are the driving force for ecosystem processes such as decomposition and carbon sequestration in terrestrial habitats, and are strongly influenced by interactions with invertebrates. Yet, interactions in detritivore communities have rarely been considered from a network perspective. In the present study, we analyse the interaction networks between three functional guilds of fungi and insects sampled from dead wood. Using DNA metabarcoding to identify fungi, we reveal a diversity of interactions differing in specificity in the detritivore networks, involving three guilds of fungi. Plant pathogenic fungi were relatively unspecialized in their interactions with insects inhabiting dead wood, while interactions between the insects and wood-decay fungi exhibited the highest degree of specialization, which was similar to estimates for animal-mediated seed dispersal networks in previous studies. The low degree of specialization for insect symbiont fungi was unexpected. In general, the pooled insect-fungus networks were significantly more specialized, more modular and less nested than randomized networks. Thus, the detritivore networks had an unusual anti-nested structure. Future studies might corroborate whether this is a common aspect of networks based on interactions with fungi, possibly owing to their often intense competition for substrate."
"Despite more than a century of biological research on the evolution and maintenance of mimetic signals, the relative frequencies of models and mimics necessary to establish and maintain Batesian mimicry in natural populations remain understudied. Here we investigate the frequency-dependent dynamics of imperfect Batesian mimicry, using predation experiments involving artificial butterfly models. We use two geographically distinct populations ofAdelphabutterflies that vary in their relative frequencies of a putatively defended model (Adelpha iphiclus) and Batesian mimic (Adelpha serpa). We found that in Costa Rica, where both species share similar abundances, Batesian mimicry breaks down, and predators more readily attack artificial butterfly models of the presumed mimic,A. serpaBy contrast, in Ecuador, whereA. iphiclus(model) is significantly more abundant thanA. serpa(mimic), both species are equally protected from predation. Our results provide compelling experimental evidence that imperfect Batesian mimicry is frequency-dependent on the relative abundance of models and mimics in natural populations, and contribute to the growing body of evidence that complex dynamics, such as seasonality or the availability of alternative prey, influence the evolution of mimetic traits."
"Dementia is an increasing world-wide health problem, and the association between dementia and adjudication of crimes has rarely been studied. The data in this study are described and analyzed by gender, psychiatric diagnosis, type of crime, and the acceptance rate by the courts of opinions tendered by forensic psychiatric examiners. The source data are derived from the databank of the Judicial Yuan (Judicial Department) of the Republic of China Law and Regulations Retrieval System. There was a male predominance of 85.1 percent. Larceny (42.6%) was the most frequent crime. There was also a high judicial acceptance rate of 91.5 percent of the professional opinions received from forensic psychiatric evaluators who examined defendants at the request of the courts. Psychiatrists play an important role in providing their professional opinions for the Taiwanese courts with regard to adjudication of evaluees with dementia. Most courts accepted psychiatrists' professional opinions about offenders with dementia, and the rate of acceptance was reflected in the judicial rulings of criminal responsibility."
"Bilins are linear tetrapyrrole chromophores with a wide range of visible and near-visible light absorption and emission properties. These properties are tuned upon binding to natural proteins and exploited in photosynthetic light-harvesting and non-photosynthetic light-sensitive signalling. These pigmented proteins are now being manipulated to develop fluorescent experimental tools. To engineer the optical properties of bound bilins for specific applications more flexibly, we have used first principles of protein folding to design novel, stable and highly adaptable bilin-binding four-?-helix bundle protein frames, called maquettes, and explored the minimal requirements underlying covalent bilin ligation and conformational restriction responsible for the strong and variable absorption, fluorescence and excitation energy transfer of these proteins. Biliverdin, phycocyanobilin and phycoerythrobilin bind covalently to maquette Cysin vitroA blue-shifted tripyrrole formed from maquette-bound phycocyanobilin displays a quantum yield of 26%. Although unrelated in fold and sequence to natural phycobiliproteins, bilin lyases nevertheless interact with maquettes during co-expression inEscherichia colito improve the efficiency of bilin binding and influence bilin structure. Bilins bindin vitroandin vivoto Cys residues placed in loops, towards the amino end or in the middle of helices but bind poorly at the carboxyl end of helices. Bilin-binding efficiency and fluorescence yield are improved by Arg and Asp residues adjacent to the ligating Cys on the same helix and by His residues on adjacent helices."
"Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine."
"The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular reprogramming process converting epithelial cells into mesenchymal cell morphology. Snail is a critical regulator of EMT by both suppressing epithelial gene expression and promoting mesenchymal gene expression. Expression and activity of Snail are tightly controlled at transcriptional and post-translational levels. It has previously been reported that Snail undergoes phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation. Here, we report nuclear phosphatase SCP4/CTDSPL2 acts as a novel Snail phosphatase. SCP4 physically interacts with and directly dephosphorylates Snail. SCP4-mediated dephosphorylation of Snail suppresses the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation of Snail and consequently enhances TGF?-induced EMT. The knockdown of SCP4 in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells leads to attenuated cell migration. Collectively, our finding demonstrates that SCP4 plays a critical role in EMT through Snail dephosphorylation and stabilization."
"ADP-ribosylation factor-like GTPase 11 (Arl11) is a cancer-predisposing gene that has remained functionally uncharacterized till date. In this study, we report that Arl11 is endogenously expressed in mouse and human macrophages and regulates their activation in response to LPS stimulation. Accordingly, depletion of Arl11 impaired both LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages, and their ability to control intracellular replication ofSalmonella LPS-stimulated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was substantially compromised in Arl11-silenced macrophages. In contrast, increased expression of Arl11 led to constitutive ERK1/2 phosphorylation, resulting in macrophage exhaustion. Finally, we found that Arl11 forms a complex with phospho-ERK in macrophages within minutes of LPS stimulation. Taken together, our findings establish Arl11 as a novel regulator of ERK signaling in macrophages, required for macrophage activation and immune function."
"Rap1 proteins are members of the Ras subfamily of small GTPases involved in many biological responses, including adhesion, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Like all small GTPases, they work as molecular allosteric units that are active in signaling only when associated with the proper membrane compartment. Prenylation, occurring in the cytosol, is an enzymatic posttranslational event that anchors small GTPases at the membrane, and prenyl-binding proteins are needed to mask the cytoplasm-exposed lipid during transit to the target membrane. However, several of these proteins still await discovery. In this study, we report that cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) binds Rap1. We found that this binding is GTP-independent, does not involve Rap1's effector domain, and is fully contained in its C-terminal hypervariable region (HVR). Furthermore, Rap1 prenylation was required for high-affinity interactions with CAP1 in a geranylgeranyl-specific manner. The prenyl binding specifically involved CAP1's C-terminal hydrophobic ?-sheet domain. We present a combination of experimental and computational approaches, yielding a model whereby the high-affinity binding between Rap1 and CAP1 involves electrostatic and nonpolar sidechain interactions between Rap1's HVR residues, lipid and CAP1 ?-sheet domain. The binding was stabilized by the lipid insertion into the elliptical ?-barrel whose interior was occupied by nonpolar sidechains. This model was reminiscent of the recently solved structure of the PDE?-K-Ras complex; accordingly, disruptors of this complex, e.g. Deltarasin, blocked the Rap1-CAP1 interaction. These findings indicate that CAP1 is a geranylgeranyl-binding partner of Rap1."
"Aerobactin, a citryl-hydroxamate siderophore, is produced by a number of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria to aid in iron assimilation. Interest in this well-known siderophore was reignited by recent investigations suggesting that it plays a key role in mediating the enhanced virulence of a hypervirulent pathotype of Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP). In contrast to classical opportunistic strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, hvKP causes serious life-threatening infections in previously healthy individuals in the community. Multiple contemporary reports have confirmed fears that the convergence of multi-drug resistant and hvKP pathotypes has led to the evolution of a highly transmissible, drug resistant, and virulent ""super bug"". Despite hvKP harboring four distinct siderophore operons, knocking out production of only aerobactin led to a significant attenuation of virulence. Herein, we continue our structural and functional studies on the biosynthesis of this crucial virulence factor. In vivo heterologous production and in vitro reconstitution of aerobactin biosynthesis from hvKP was carried out, demonstrating the specificity, stereoselectivity, and kinetic throughput of the complete pathway. Additionally, we present a steady-state kinetic analysis and the X-ray crystal structure of the second aerobactin synthetase IucC, as well as describe a surface entropy reduction strategy that was employed for structure determination. Finally, we show solution X-ray scattering data that supports a unique dimeric quaternary structure for IucC. These new insights into aerobactin assembly will help inform potential antivirulence strategies and advance our understanding of siderophore biosynthesis."
"As whole genome sequencing becomes an established component of the microbiologist's toolbox, it is imperative that researchers, clinical microbiologists and public health professionals have access to genomic analysis tools for rapid extraction of epidemiologically and clinically relevant information. For the gram-negative hospital pathogens such asKlebsiella pneumoniae, initial efforts have focused on detection and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance genes and clones. However, with the resurgence of interest in alternative infection control strategies targetingKlebsiellasurface polysaccharides, the ability to extract information about these antigens is increasingly important.Here we present Kaptive Web, an online tool for rapid typing ofKlebsiellaK and O loci, which encode the polysaccharide capsule and lipopolysaccharide O antigen, respectively. Kaptive Web enables users to upload and analyse genome assemblies in a web browser. Results can be downloaded in tabular format or explored in detail via the graphical interface, making it accessible for users at all levels of computational expertise.We demonstrate Kaptive Web's utility by analysis of >500K. pneumoniaegenomes. We identify extensive K and O locus diversity among 201 genomes belonging to the carbapenemase-associated clonal group 258 (25 K and six O loci). Characterisation of a further 309 genomes indicates that such diversity is common among the multi-drug resistant clones and that these loci represent useful epidemiological markers for strain subtyping. These findings reinforce the need for rapid, reliable and accessible typing methods such as Kaptive Web.Kaptive Web is available for use at kaptive.holtlab.net and source code is available at github.com/kelwyres/Kaptive-Web."
"Testosterone is indispensable for sexual development and maintaining male characteristics, and deficiency of this hormone results in primary or late-onset hypogonadism (LOH). Testosterone is primarily produced in Leydig cells, where autophagy has been reported to be extremely active. However, the functional role of autophagy in testosterone synthesis remains unknown. In this study, we show that steroidogenic cell-specific disruption of autophagy influenced the sexual behavior of aging male mice because of a reduction in serum testosterone, which is similar to the symptoms of LOH. The decline in testosterone was caused mainly by a defect in cholesterol uptake in autophagy-deficient Leydig cells. Further studies revealed that once autophagic flux was disrupted, Na+/H+exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2) accumulated in Leydig cells, resulting in the down-regulation of scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) and eventually leading to insufficient cholesterol supply. Collectively, these results reveal that autophagy promotes cholesterol uptake into Leydig cells by eliminating NHERF2, suggesting that dysfunction of autophagy might be causal in the loss of testosterone production in some patients."
"The production of high-affinity antibody is essential for pathogen clearance. Antibody affinity is increased through germinal center (GC) affinity maturation, which relies on BCR somatic hypermutation (SHM) followed by antigen-based selection. GC B cell proliferation is essentially involved in these processes; it provides enough templates for SHM and also serves as a critical mechanism of positive selection. In this study, we show that expression of epigenetic regulator ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1 (Uhrf1) was markedly up-regulated by c-Myc-AP4 in GC B cells, and it was required for GC response. Uhrf1 regulates cell proliferation-associated genes includingcdkn1a,slfn1, andslfn2by DNA methylation, and its deficiency inhibited the GC B cell cycle at G1-S phase. Subsequently, GC B cell SHM and affinity maturation were impaired, and Uhrf1 GC B knockout mice were unable to control chronic virus infection. Collectively, our data suggest that Uhrf1 regulates GC B cell proliferation and affinity maturation, and its expression in GC B cells is required for virus clearance."
"Understanding the molecular mechanisms and evolution of the gene regulatory system remains a major challenge in biology. Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) are especially interesting because they are central to initiating gene expression. Previous studies revealed widespread transcription initiation and fast turnover of TSSs in mammalian genomes. Yet, how new TSSs originate and how they evolve over time remain poorly understood. To address these questions, we analyzed ~200,000 human TSSs by integrating evolutionary (inter- and intra-species) and functional genomic data, particularly focusing on evolutionarily young TSSs that emerged in the primate lineage. TSSs were grouped according to their evolutionary age using sequence alignment information as a proxy. Comparisons of young and old TSSs revealed that: 1) new TSSs emerge through a combination of intrinsic factors like the sequence properties of transposable elements and tandem repeats, and extrinsic factors such as their proximity to existing regulatory modules; 2) new TSSs undergo rapid evolution that reduces the inherent instability of repeat sequences associated with a high propensity of TSS emergence; and 3) once established, the transcriptional competence of surviving TSSs is gradually enhanced, with evolutionary changes subject to temporal (fewer regulatory changes in younger TSSs) and spatial constraints (fewer regulatory changes in more isolated TSSs). These findings advance our understanding of how regulatory innovations arise in the genome throughout evolution and highlight the genomic robustness and evolvability in these processes."
"Female birds transfer maternally derived antibodies (matAb) to their nestlings, via the egg yolk. These antibodies are thought to provide passive protection, and allow nestlings to avoid the costs associated with mounting an innate immune response. To test whether there is an energetic benefit to nestlings from receiving matAb, we challenged adult female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) prior to clutch initiation with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline (Control). Following hatching, one half of each female's nestlings were immunized on day 8 post-hatch with LPS or saline, and the 4-h post-immunization nestling metabolic rate (MR) was measured. There was no difference in either LPS-reactive antibodies or total Ig levels between offspring of immunized and non-immunized mothers on day 6 or 14 post-hatch, possibly reflecting a relatively short half-life of matAbs in altricial birds. Additionally, we found no evidence that nestlings from LPS-immunized mothers could avoid the growth suppression that may result from activation of an inflammatory response. Unexpectedly, we found that control nestlings from LPS mothers had higher resting MR than control nestlings of control mothers. We attribute the increased MR to the costs associated with a general non-specific enhancement of immune function in nestlings from LPS-immunized mothers. Consistent with enhanced immune function, nestlings of immunized mothers had a more robust inflammatory response to phytohaemagglutinin and higher fledging success. Our results suggest that maternal antigen exposure pre-laying can result in increased fitness for both mothers and offspring, depending on food availability."
"Antibiotic resistance in avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) is a common problem in the Indonesian poultry industry. Zoo birds have been postulated as sentinels, reservoirs, and potential spreaders of antibiotic resistance, although much is still unknown about the strains of zoo birds. Disinfection can reduce the infection burden. However, little is known about the presence of resistance against these products. Sixty one APEC strains were isolated from Indonesian zoo birds. The resistance to different classes of antibiotics as well as the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of five disinfectants most often used in the poultry industry was determined. Resistance to tetracycline (42.6%), sulfonamides (24.5%), ampicillin (22.9%), gentamicin (19.6), nalidixic acid (18.03%) and streptomycin (16.3%) was high, but resistance to other tested antibiotics was low and none of the isolates were resistant to extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. Sixteen strains (26.2%) were found positive for multi drug resistance. The MIC of the disinfectants for the APEC strains showed normal distribution, indicating that there was no acquired resistance. MBCs were similar to MICs using the broth dilution method, showing the bactericidal effect of the disinfectants. Phenotypic resistance to commonly used disinfectants could not be found, indicating that the current use of disinfectants in the zoo and aviaries did not select for resistance. Significantly high resistance rates against commonly used antibiotics in Indonesian zoos is worrisome and indicates that widespread use of antibiotics could have negative implications for animal health and the environment. Proper use of antibiotics and surveillance programs to monitor antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria are warranted."
"Hepatitis C infection imposes a high economic burden globally. It has been estimated that in 2012, the healthcare cost of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was $6.5 billion. Furthermore, it has been projected that the cost will reach at $9.1 billion by the year 2024.Frequency of hepatitis C in Pakistan is significantly higher (4.5%) when compared to the populations like India (0.7%), Nepal (1.0), Myanmar (2.5%), Iran (0.8%), China (1%) and Afghanistan (1.1%). The current standard of care for chronic infection with hepatitis C virus is 24 or 48 weeks of therapy with Pegylated interferon-alfa-2a (Peg INF) +Ribavirin (RV) or Interferon alfa-2a (INF) + RV. The objective of this study was to determine that which combination is more effective and the gain in sustained virologic response (SVR) is worth the incremental cost. In total 84 patients were enrolled who received current standard treatment of care for chronic infection with HCV either 24 or 48 weeks of therapy with Peg INF + RV or INF + RV. A pharmacoeconomic analysis was done including fixed and variable cost (comprising concomitant therapies, emergency visits and hospital admissions) of both treatment regimens were calculated and compared with the SVR accomplished by the patients. It was concluded that the Peg INF + RV is cost effective as compared with conventional INF + RV for the treatment of adult patients infected with HCV genotype 3a under a varied array of possibilities regarding treatment costs and effectiveness."
"                    Background
: Lectin was initially called hemagglutinin or agglutinin because of its capacity to agglutinate human as well as human erythrocytes. They are a heterogeneous group of proteins or glycoproteins of nonimmune origin. Because of their chemical properties, they have become a useful tool in several fields such as immunology, cell biology, molecular biology, membrane structure, pharmacology, cancer research, clinical chemistry, and genetic engineering.Objective: The wide applications of lectins users urged the need to isolate lectins from a new strain of bacteria can produce new and high yield of lectin because the current production of lectin fromPseudomonasspp. is very expensive. The goal of this study was to screen the ability ofAcinetobacter baumanniiisolates to produce lectin and detection of its phenotypic and genotypic profiles and detection of lectin ability to inhibit of biofilm formation.Methods: Fifty-one isolates from different sources were collected and detected genetically by using the recA gene. Phenotypic detection of lectin by using semi-quantitative analysis and quantitative analysis in microtiter plate. Genotypic detection of lectin by designedlecgene and used PCR technique. The lectin was extracted by using glass beads and purified by chromatographyic technique followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for determination the molecular size of lectin and finally detection the spectrum of biofilm inhibition by the purified lectin toward biofilm producers.Results: Of 51A. baumanniiisolates, 17 (33.3%) have been found to produce lectin. Ten of 17 were sequenced, of which 2 were submitted and tested by the gene bank National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and accession numbers (KX766405.1 and KX766406.1) were obtained. These 17 isolates were phenotypically and genotypically positive for lectin and showed differentlecgene expression in semi-quantitative and quantitative analysis. The activities ranged between 4-128 U/mL. Lectin purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation was used to inhibit biofilm formation. We found reduction at three different types of bacteria ranging from 26% forKlebsiella pneumonia, 46.7% forP. stutzeriand 53% forA. baumannii. These results suggested that lectin has a promising application as an antibiofilm agent to combat the growing number of multidrug-resistant pathogen-associated infections.Conclusions: Lectin has been detected recently inA. baumannii, but the genetic property of this lectin has not yet been fully studied. In our study, we determined the presence of the lectin gene (lecgene) inA. baumanniiby using PCR technique, andlecPCR products were identified with various source of isolation and sequenced to screening for epidemiology and submitted to the gene bank NCBI under accession number (KX766405.1 and KX766406.1).Highlights:A. baumanniihas an ability to produce lectin protein; Lec gene was detected inA. baumannii, and the sequence was recorded under accession number KX766405.1 and KX766406.1.; Lectin was extracted by glass beads and purified by chromatographyic technique; Lectin had strong effect against biofilm formation."
"Some of the key steps in cancer metastasis are the migration and invasion of tumor cells; these processes require rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. Actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments involved in the formation of cytoskeletal structures, such as stress fibers and pseudopodia, promote the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Therefore, it is important to explore the mechanisms underlying cytoskeletal regulation. The ras homolog family (Rho) and Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein serine/threonine kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton. Moreover, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have essential roles in tumor migration and guide gene regulation during cancer progression. LncRNAs can regulate the cytoskeleton directly or may influence the cytoskeleton via Rho/ROCK signaling during tumor migration. In this review, we focus on the regulatory association between lncRNAs and the cytoskeleton and discuss the pathways and mechanisms involved in the regulation of cancer metastasis."
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway demonstrated promising activities in variety of malignancies, however little is known regarding their efficacy in adults aged ?65 years.We conducted a systematic review and a study-level meta-analysis to explore efficacy of ICIs based on age, younger vs older than 65 years. We included in this analysis randomized controlled phase II or III studies in patients with metastatic solid tumors that compared efficacy of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors to a non-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. Aggregated estimates of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) are based on random/mixed effects (RE) models to allow for heterogeneity between the studies.Initial search identified 53 articles, 17 were randomized controlled trials that compared nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab to chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Only 9 trials reported hazard ratiios (HR) for OS based on age and were included in this meta-analysis. Out of those studies seven reported HR for PFS but only 4 studies included subgroup-analysis based on age for PFS. The overall estimated random-effects HR for death was 0.64 with 95% CI of 0.54-0.76 in patients ?65 years vs. 0.68 with 95% CI of 0.61-0.75 in patients <?65 years. The overall estimated random-effects for HR for progression was 0.74 with 95% CI of 0.60-0.92 in patients ?65 years vs. 0.73 with 95% CI of 0.61-0.88 in patients <?65 years.PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 (atezolizumab) inhibitors had comparable efficacy in adults younger vs???65 years."
"One of today's greatest hurdles for cancer immunotherapy is the absence of information regarding which tumor antigens are already recognized by patients receiving immunotherapies, and whether those therapies then boost or generate an immune response against tumor proteins. For CD8+ T cells in particular, patient-specific immune recognition and responses at the level of individual tumor antigens are rarely characterized. Because of this, some immunologists have turned to serum antibodies as an alternative measure of antigen-specific anti-tumor immunity. In this work, we sought to simultaneously interrogate serum IgG and CD8+ T cell recognition of individual tumor antigens to determine whether antigen-specific serum IgG antibodies provide a window into the behavior of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Using antibody-based assays to evaluate immune response repertoires and focus T cell antigen exploration could afford substantial advantages for discovering and monitoring the anti-cancer immune responses of patients enrolled on clinical trials.We vaccinated female BALB/c mice with a novel combination of an autophagosome-enriched vaccine derived from 4T1 mammary carcinoma along with poly-I:C adjuvant, then screened serum for IgG binding to arrays of 15mer peptides containing known mutation sites in 4T1. Simultaneously, we primed CD8+ T cell cultures from these same animals with 8-11mer peptides derived from these antigens. These primed T cells were then stimulated to measure recognition of the peptides or live 4T1 cells by IFN? release.Vaccinated animals demonstrate increases in antigen-specific CD8+ T cell recognition of 4T1 tumor cells and peptides. For proteins confirmed in 4T1 cells and vaccine by mass spectrometry, there is a correlation between this increased CD8+ T cell IFN? release and serum IgG binding to individual peptide antigens.These results suggest it is possible to observe some features of a patient's antigen-specific T cell repertoire via an antibody surrogate, which has implications for tumor antigen discovery and clinical monitoring of antigen-specific anti-tumor immunity."
"Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) is an indigenous species and the predominant vector of dengue fever in China. Understanding of genetic diversity and structure of the mosquito would facilitate dengue prevention and vector control. Sympatric cryptic species have been identified in the Ae. albopictus subgroup in Southeast Asia; however, little is known about the presence and distribution of cryptic species in China. This study aimed to examine the genetic diversity, evaluate potential new cryptic sibling species, and assess the prevalence of Wolbachia infections in field populations.Aedes adult female specimens were collected from five provinces in southern and central China during 2015-2016. Morphological identification was performed under dissection microscope. The mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1, DNA barcoding) locus and the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) marker were used to examine the genetic variation, evaluate cryptic sibling species, and population structure in the field populations. Screening for the presence of Wolbachia was performed using multiplex PCR.A total of 140 individual specimens with morphological characteristics similar to Ae. albopictus were sequenced for DNA barcoding. Among these, 129 specimens (92.1%) were confirmed and identified as Ae. albopictus. The remaining 11 specimens, from 2 provinces, were identified as 2 distinct sequence groups, which were confirmed by ITS2 marker sequencing, suggesting the existence of potential cryptic species of Ae. albopictus. In Ae. albopictus, we found significant genetic differentiation and population structure between populations collected from different climate zones. Medium to high frequencies of Wolbachia infections were observed in natural Ae. albopictus populations, whereas Wolbachia was infrequent or absent in cryptic species populations.Our findings highlight the population differentiation by climate zone and the presence of novel, cryptic Aedes species in China. The low prevalence of Wolbachia infections in cryptic species populations could reflect either a recent invasion of Wolbachia in Ae. albopictus or different host immune responses to this symbiont in the cryptic species. The study provides useful information for vector control and host-symbiont coevolution. Further study is needed to investigate the potential for arbovirus infection and disease transmission in the emerged cryptic species."
"Meiosis is a specialized germ cell cycle that generates haploid gametes. In the initial stage of meiosis, meiotic prophase I (MPI), homologous chromosomes pair and recombine. Extensive changes in chromatin in MPI raise an important question concerning the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation to meiosis. Interestingly, previous studies concluded that in male mice, genome-wide DNA methylation patters are set in place prior to meiosis and remain constant subsequently. However, no prior studies examined DNA methylation during MPI in a systematic manner necessitating its further investigation.In this study, we used genome-wide bisulfite sequencing to determine DNA methylation of adult mouse spermatocytes at all MPI substages, spermatogonia and haploid sperm. This analysis uncovered transient reduction of DNA methylation (TRDM) of spermatocyte genomes. The genome-wide scope of TRDM, its onset in the meiotic S phase and presence of hemimethylated DNA in MPI are all consistent with a DNA replication-dependent DNA demethylation. Following DNA replication, spermatocytes regain DNA methylation gradually but unevenly, suggesting that key MPI events occur in the context of hemimethylated genome. TRDM also uncovers the prior deficit of DNA methylation of LINE-1 retrotransposons in spermatogonia resulting in their full demethylation during TRDM and likely contributing to the observed mRNA and protein expression of some LINE-1 elements in early MPI.Our results suggest that contrary to the prevailing view, chromosomes exhibit dynamic changes in DNA methylation in MPI. We propose that TRDM facilitates meiotic prophase processes and gamete quality control."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the sixth most prevalent cancer and the third leading cause of tumor-related death, so it is urgently needed to discover efficient markers and targets for therapy. ?-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase II (B3GALNT2) belongs to the ?-1,3-glycosyltransferases (b3GT) family and has been reported to regulate development of both normal and tumor tissues. However, studies on the functions of B3GALNT2 in cancer are quite limited. Here we investigated the potential role of B3GALNT2 in HCC progression.Western blot, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry assays were performed to quantify the relative expression of B3GALNT2 in HCC. The functions of B3GALNT2 in tumor progression were evaluated in HCC cell lines and nude mice. Metabolomics analysis was applied to detect alternatively expressed small molecules. Enzyme activity assays were employed to determine the tautomerase activity of macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF).For expression analysis, higher levels of B3GALNT2 were observed in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and upregulation of B3GALNT2 correlated with increased tumor size and worse overall survival. Changing levels of B3GALNT2 did not influence cell viability in vitro but promoted tumor growth via enhancing macrophage recruitment in vivo. Furthermore, acetoacetate was identified as a key molecule in B3GALNT2-mediated macrophage recruitment. Mechanistically, B3GALNT2 downregulated expression of enzymes involved in acetoacetate-related metabolism, and reduction of acetoacetate revived MIF activity, thus promoting macrophage recruitment.This study evaluated B3GALNT2 as a tumor marker in HCC and revealed functions of B3GALNT2 in metabolic transformation and microenvironmental remodeling in HCC. Mechanistically, B3GALNT2 reduced expression of some metabolic enzymes and thus downregulated levels of secreted acetoacetate. This relieved the activity of MIF and enhanced macrophage recruitment to promote tumor growth."
"Mouse homozygous mutants in Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway genes have been shown to cause neural tube defects (NTDs) through the disruption of normal morphogenetic processes critical to neural tube closure (NTC). Knockout mice that are heterozygotes of single PCP genes likely fail to produce NTD phenotypes, yet damaging variants detected in human NTDs are almost always heterozygous, suggesting that other deleterious interacting variants are likely to be present. Nonetheless, the Wnt/PCP pathway remains a genetic hotspot. Addressing these issues is essential for understanding the genetic etiology of human NTDs.We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) on 30 NTD-predisposing Wnt/PCP pathway genes in 184 Chinese NTD cases. We subsequently replicated our findings for the CELSR1 gene in an independent cohort of 292 Caucasian NTD samples from the USA. Functional validations were confirmed using in vitro assays.CELSR1, CELSR2 and CELSR3 genes were significantly clustered with rare driver coding mutations (q-value<?0.05) demonstrated by OncodriveCLUST. During the validation stage, the number of rare loss of function (LoF) variants in CELSR1 was significantly enriched in NTDs compared with the LoF counts in the ExAC database (p < 0.001). Functional studies indicated compound heterozygote variants of CELSR2 p.Thr2026Met and DVL3 p.Asp403Asn result in down regulation of PCP signals.These data indicate rare damaging variants of the CELSR genes, identified in ~?14% of NTD cases, are expected to be driver genes in the Wnt/PCP pathway. Compound damaging variants of CELSR genes and other Wnt/PCP genes, which were observed in 3.3% of the studied NTD cohort, are also expected to amplify these effects at the pathway level."
"In West and Central Africa areas of endemic Loa loa infections overlap with regions of high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections. Because individuals in this region are exposed to filarial parasites from birth, most HIV-1 infected individuals invariably also have a history of filarial parasite infection. Since HIV-1 infection both depletes immune system and maintains it in perpetual inflammation, this can hamper Loa loa filarial parasite mediated immune modulation, leading to enhanced loaisis.In this study we have assessed in plasma from asymptomatic anti-retroviral (ARV) naïve Loa loa microfilaraemic HIV-1 infected people the filarial antibody responses specific to a filariasis composite antigen consisting of Wbgp29-BmR1-BmM14-WbSXP. The antibody responses specific to the filariasis composite antigen was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in plasma from ARV naïve Loa loa microfilaraemic HIV-1 infected participants. In addition the filarial antigen specific IgG antibody subclass profiles were also determined for both HIV-1 positive and negative people.Both Loa loa microfilaraemic HIV-1 positive and negative individuals showed significantly higher plasma levels of IgG1 (P?<?0.0001), IgG2 (P?<?0.0001) and IgM (P?<?0.0001) relative to amicrofilaraemic participants. A significant increase in IgE (P?<?0.0001) was observed exclusively in Loa loa microfilaraemic HIV-1 infected people. In contrast there was a significant reduction in the level of IgG4 (p?<?0.0001) and IgG3 (P?<?0.0001) in Loa loa microfilaraemic HIV-1 infected individuals.Loa loa microfilaraemia in ARV naïve HIV-1 infected people through differential reduction of plasma levels of filarial antigen specific IgG3, IgG4 and a significant increase in plasma levels of filarial antigen specific IgE could diminish Loa loa mediated immune-regulation. This in effect can result to increase loaisis mediated immunopathology in antiretroviral naive HIV-1 infected people."
"Epilithic sister genera Oresitrophe and Mukdenia (Saxifragaceae) have an epilithic habitat (rocky slopes) and a parapatric distribution in East Asia, which makes them an ideal model for a more comprehensive understanding of the demographic and divergence history and the influence of climate changes in East Asia. However, the genetic background and resources for these two genera are scarce.The complete chloroplast (cp) genomes of two Oresitrophe rupifraga and one Mukdenia rossii individuals were reconstructed and comparative analyses were conducted to examine the evolutionary pattern of chloroplast genomes in Saxifragaceae. The cp genomes ranged from 156,738 bp to 156,960 bp in length and had a typical quadripartite structure with a conserved genome arrangement. Comparative analysis revealed the intron of rpl2 has been lost in Heuchera parviflora, Tiarella polyphylla, M. rossii and O. rupifraga but presents in the reference genome of Penthorum chinense. Seven cp hotspot regions (trnH-psbA, trnR-atpA, atpI-rps2, rps2-rpoC2, petN-psbM, rps4-trnT and rpl33-rps18) were identified between Oresitrophe and Mukdenia, while four hotspots (trnQ-psbK, trnR-atpA, trnS-psbZ and rpl33-rps18) were identified within Oresitrophe. In addition, 24 polymorphic cpSSR loci were found between Oresitrophe and Mukdenia. Most importantly, we successfully developed 126 intergeneric polymorphic gSSR markers between Oresitrophe and Mukdenia, as well as 452 intrageneric ones within Oresitrophe. Twelve randomly selected intergeneric gSSRs have shown that these two genera exhibit a significant genetic structure.In this study, we conducted genome skimming for Oresitrophe rupifraga and Mukdenia rossii. Using these data, we were able to not only assemble their complete chloroplast genomes, but also develop abundant genetic resources (cp hotspots, cpSSRs, polymorphic gSSRs). The genomic patterns and genetic resources presented here will contribute to further studies on population genetics, phylogeny and conservation biology in Saxifragaceae."
"Intraspecific variation in ploidy occurs in a wide range of species including pathogenic and nonpathogenic eukaryotes such as yeasts and oomycetes. Ploidy can be inferred indirectly - without measuring DNA content - from experiments using next-generation sequencing (NGS). We present nQuire, a statistical framework that distinguishes between diploids, triploids and tetraploids using NGS. The command-line tool models the distribution of base frequencies at variable sites using a Gaussian Mixture Model, and uses maximum likelihood to select the most plausible ploidy model. nQuire handles large genomes at high coverage efficiently and uses standard input file formats.We demonstrate the utility of nQuire analyzing individual samples of the pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora infestans and the Baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using these organisms we show the dependence between reliability of the ploidy assignment and sequencing depth. Additionally, we employ normalized maximized log- likelihoods generated by nQuire to ascertain ploidy level in a population of samples with ploidy heterogeneity. Using these normalized values we cluster samples in three dimensions using multivariate Gaussian mixtures. The cluster assignments retrieved from a S. cerevisiae population recovered the true ploidy level in over 96% of samples. Finally, we show that nQuire can be used regionally to identify chromosomal aneuploidies.nQuire provides a statistical framework to study organisms with intraspecific variation in ploidy. nQuire is likely to be useful in epidemiological studies of pathogens, artificial selection experiments, and for historical or ancient samples where intact nuclei are not preserved. It is implemented as a stand-alone Linux command line tool in the C programming language and is available at https://github.com/clwgg/nQuire under the MIT license."
"AceTree, a software application first released in 2006, facilitates exploration, curation and editing of tracked C. elegans nuclei in 4-dimensional (4D) fluorescence microscopy datasets. Since its initial release, AceTree has been continuously used to interact with, edit and interpret C. elegans lineage data. In its 11 year lifetime, AceTree has been periodically updated to meet the technical and research demands of its community of users. This paper presents the newest iteration of AceTree which contains extensive updates, demonstrates the new applicability of AceTree in other developmental contexts, and presents its evolutionary software development paradigm as a viable model for maintaining scientific software.Large scale updates have been made to the user interface for an improved user experience. Tools have been grouped according to functionality and obsolete methods have been removed. Internal requirements have been changed that enable greater flexibility of use both in C. elegans contexts and in other model organisms. Additionally, the original 3-dimensional (3D) viewing window has been completely reimplemented. The new window provides a new suite of tools for data exploration.By responding to technical advancements and research demands, AceTree has remained a useful tool for scientific research for over a decade. The updates made to the codebase have extended AceTree's applicability beyond its initial use in C. elegans and enabled its usage with other model organisms. The evolution of AceTree demonstrates a viable model for maintaining scientific software over long periods of time."
"The pattern of data availability in a phylogenetic data set may lead to the formation of terraces, collections of equally optimal trees. Terraces can arise in tree space if trees are scored with parsimony or with partitioned, edge-unlinked maximum likelihood. Theory predicts that terraces can be large, but their prevalence in contemporary data sets has never been surveyed. We selected 26 data sets and phylogenetic trees reported in recent literature and investigated the terraces to which the trees would belong, under a common set of inference assumptions. We examined terrace size as a function of the sampling properties of the data sets, including taxon coverage density (the proportion of taxon-by-gene positions with any data present) and a measure of gene sampling ""sufficiency"". We evaluated each data set in relation to the theoretical minimum gene sampling depth needed to reduce terrace size to a single tree, and explored the impact of the terraces found in replicate trees in bootstrap methods.Terraces were identified in nearly all data sets with taxon coverage densities <?0.90. They were not found, however, in high-coverage-density (i.e., ? 0.94) transcriptomic and genomic data sets. The terraces could be very large, and size varied inversely with taxon coverage density and with gene sampling sufficiency. Few data sets achieved a theoretical minimum gene sampling depth needed to reduce terrace size to a single tree. Terraces found during bootstrap resampling reduced overall support.If certain inference assumptions apply, trees estimated from empirical data sets often belong to large terraces of equally optimal trees. Terrace size correlates to data set sampling properties. Data sets seldom include enough genes to reduce terrace size to one tree. When bootstrap replicate trees lie on a terrace, statistical support for phylogenetic hypotheses may be reduced. Although some of the published analyses surveyed were conducted with edge-linked inference models (which do not induce terraces), unlinked models have been used and advocated. The present study describes the potential impact of that inference assumption on phylogenetic inference in the context of the kinds of multigene data sets now widely assembled for large-scale tree construction."
"One of the important components of the concept of aging-phenoptosis (programmed aging) is the notion of aging as an accelerator of evolution having the rank of subconcept. For many reasons, the main being the problematic experimental testing of evolutionary hypotheses, verification of the above-mentioned subconcept can be based primarily on analysis of the internal inconsistency of heuristic models and their correspondence to undisputedly observed facts. To illustrate the acceleration mechanism, and most importantly to structure the evolutionary process in communities that include naturally weakened individuals, V. P. Skulachev offered in 2003 a conceptual model that he later called a ""fable about hares"". Despite its simplicity, this model has undoubted internal logic. The natural trend in the development of conceptual models is their translation into the language of mathematics. The purpose of the present work was to create a variation of the known multi-agent model ""predator-prey"" that would allow us to ""see"" how the presence in the prey population of naturally weakened (old) members stimulates the selection of individuals with traits whose adaptive potential is not devaluated with age. The model (http://homebear.ru/PD) was developed on the Java platform, version 6, NetBeans development environment 8.2. Statistical analysis and preparation of illustrative materials were carried out using environment R, version 3.4.1. The results of numerical experiments set using our model correspond in principle to the provisions of the heuristic model of Skulachev and, consequently, confirm the absence in it of logical contradictions."
"We show for the first time that natural 2,5-diketopiperazines (cyclic dipeptides) can suppress the activity of the important anticancer target poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). Cyclo(L-Ala-L-Ala) and cyclo(L-Ala-D-Ala) can interact with the key residues of the PARP-1 active site, as demonstrated using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. One of the amide groups of cyclo(L-Ala-L-Ala) and cyclo(L-Ala-D-Ala) forms hydrogen bonds with the Gly863 residue, while the second amide group can form a hydrogen bond with the catalytic residue Glu988, and the side chain can make a hydrophobic contact with Ala898. Newly identified diketopiperazine inhibitors are promising basic structures for the design of more effective inhibitors of PARP family enzymes. The piperazine core with two chiral centers provides many opportunities for structural optimization."
"Many proteins need recognition of specific DNA sequences for functioning. The number of recognition sites and their distribution along the DNA might be of biological importance. For example, the number of restriction sites is often reduced in prokaryotic and phage genomes to decrease the probability of DNA cleavage by restriction endonucleases. We call a sequence an exceptional one if its frequency in a genome significantly differs from one predicted by some mathematical model. An exceptional sequence could be either under- or over-represented, depending on its frequency in comparison with the predicted one. Exceptional sequences could be considered biologically meaningful, for example, as targets of DNA-binding proteins or as parts of abundant repetitive elements. Several methods to predict frequency of a short sequence in a genome, based on actual frequencies of certain its subsequences, are used. The most popular are methods based on Markov chain models. But any rigorous comparison of the methods has not previously been performed. We compared three methods for the prediction of short sequence frequencies: the maximum-order Markov chain model-based method, the method that uses geometric mean of extended Markovian estimates, and the method that utilizes frequencies of all subsequences including discontiguous ones. We applied them to restriction sites in complete genomes of 2500 prokaryotic species and demonstrated that the results depend greatly on the method used: lists of 5% of the most under-represented sites differed by up to 50%. The method designed by Burge and coauthors in 1992, which utilizes all subsequences of the sequence, showed a higher precision than the other two methods both on prokaryotic genomes and randomly generated sequences after computational imitation of selective pressure. We propose this method as the first choice for detection of exceptional sequences in prokaryotic genomes."
"Mitochondrial genome has undergone significant reduction in a course of evolution; however, it still contains a set of protein-encoding genes and requires translational machinery for their expression. Mitochondrial translation is of the prokaryotic type with several remarkable differences. This review is dedicated to one of the most puzzling features of mitochondrial protein synthesis, namely, the system of translational activators, i.e., proteins that specifically regulate translation of individual mitochondrial mRNAs and couple protein biosynthesis with the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. The review does not claim to be a comprehensive analysis of all published data; it is rather focused on the idea of the ""core component"" of the translational activator system."
"The addition of new neurons and oligodendroglia in the postnatal and adult mammalian brain presents distinct forms of gray and white matter plasticity. Substantial effort has been devoted to understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling postnatal neurogenesis and gliogenesis, revealing important parallels to principles governing the embryonic stages. While during central nervous system development, scripted temporal and spatial patterns of neural and glial progenitor proliferation and differentiation are necessary to create the nervous system architecture, it remains unclear what driving forces maintain and sustain postnatal neural stem cell (NSC) and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) production of new neurons and glia. In recent years, neuronal activity has been identified as an important modulator of these processes. Using the distinct properties of neurotransmitter ionotropic and metabotropic channels to signal downstream cellular events, NSCs and OPCs share common features in their readout of neuronal activity patterns. Here we review the current evidence for neuronal activity-dependent control of NSC/OPC proliferation and differentiation in the postnatal brain, highlight some potential mechanisms used by the two progenitor populations, and discuss future studies that might advance these research areas further.

"The noncoding portion of the genome, including microRNAs, has been fertile evolutionary soil for cortical development in primates. A major contribution to cortical expansion in primates is the generation of novel precursor cell populations. Because miRNA expression profiles track closely with cell identity, it is likely that numerous novel microRNAs have contributed to cellular diversity in the brain. The tools to determine the genomic context within which novel microRNAs emerge and how they become integrated into molecular circuitry are now in hand. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Neuroscience Volume 41 is July 8, 2018. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates."
"Ceramides are sphingolipids containing a sphingosine or a related base, to which a fatty acid is linked through an amide bond. When incorporated into a lipid bilayer, ceramides exhibit a number of properties not shared by almost any other membrane lipid: Ceramides (a) are extremely hydrophobic and thus cannot exist in suspension in aqueous media; (b) increase the molecular order (rigidity) of phospholipids in membranes; (c) give rise to lateral phase separation and domain formation in phospholipid bilayers; (d) possess a marked intrinsic negative curvature that facilitates formation of inverted hexagonal phases; (e) make bilayers and cell membranes permeable to small and large (i.e., protein-size) solutes; and (f) promote transmembrane (flip-flop) lipid motion. Unfortunately, there is hardly any link between the physical studies reviewed here and the mass of biological and clinical studies on the effects of ceramides in health and disease. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Biophysics Volume 47 is May 20, 2018. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates."
"Living cells detect and process external signals using signaling pathways that are affected by random fluctuations. These variations cause the behavior of individual cells to fluctuate over time (behavioral variability) and generate phenotypic differences between genetically identical individuals (phenotypic diversity). These two noise sources reduce our ability to predict biological behavior because they diversify cellular responses to identical signals. Here, we review recent experimental and theoretical advances in understanding the mechanistic origin and functional consequences of such variation in Escherichia coli chemotaxis-a well-understood model of signal transduction and behavior. After briefly summarizing the architecture and logic of the chemotaxis system, we discuss determinants of behavior and chemotactic performance of individual cells. Then, we review how cell-to-cell differences in protein abundance map onto differences in individual chemotactic abilities and how phenotypic variability affects the performance of the population. We conclude with open questions to be addressed by future research. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Biophysics Volume 47 is May 20, 2018.

"Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is treated as a molecular therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of cancer. Geldanamycin (GA) was the first identified natural Hsp90 inhibitor, but hepatotoxicity has limited its clinical application. Nevertheless, a new GA analog (WK-88-1) with the non-benzoquinone skeleton, obtained from the genetically engineeredStreptomyces hygroscopicus, was found to haveanticancer activity against two human breast cancer cell lines.WK-88-1 produced concentration-dependent inhibition in cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis inestrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 andER-negativeMDA-MB-231 cell lines. Detailed analysis showed that WK-88-1 down-regulatedsome key cell cycle molecules (CDK1and cyclin B1) and lead tothe G2/M cell cycle arrest. Further studies also showed that WK-88-1 could induce human breast cancer cells apoptosis by down-regulating of Hsp90 client proteins (Akt, p-Akt,IKK, c-Raf,and Bcl-2),decreasing the ATP level, increasing reactive oxygen species production, and lowering the mitochondrial membrane potential. Meanwhile, we discovered that WK-88-1 did significantly decrease the levels of Her-2 and ER-in MCF-7 cells as didnot in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, WK-88-1 also significantly increased caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities and the cleavage of PARP in a concentration-dependent manner (with the exception of caspase-3 and PARP in MCF-7 cells). Taken together, our preliminary results suggest that WK-88-1 has the potential to play a role in breast cancer therapy."
"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling occurs concurrently with the many processes that constitute nervous system development. Although Shh is mostly known for its proliferative and morphogenic action through its effects on neural stem cells and progenitors, it also contributes to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding and synapse formation and function. To participate in these diverse events, Shh signaling manifests differently depending on the maturational state of the responsive cell, on the other signaling pathways regulating neural cell function and the environmental cues that surround target cells. Shh signaling is particularly dynamic in the nervous system, ranging from canonical transcription-dependent, to non-canonical and localized to axonal growth cones. Here, we review the variety of Shh functions in the developing nervous system and their consequences for neurodevelopmental diseases and neural regeneration, with particular emphasis on the signaling mechanisms underlying Shh action."
"In multiple tissues, the Hedgehog secreted morphogen activates in the receiving cells a pathway involved in cell fate, proliferation and differentiation in the receiving cells. This pathway is particularly important during embryogenesis. The protein HHAT (HedgehogO-acyltransferase) modifies Hh morphogens prior to their secretion, while HHATL (HhO-acyltransferase-like) negatively regulates the pathway. HHAT and HHATL are homologous toSaccharomyces cerevisiaeGup2 and Gup1, respectively. In yeast, Gup1 is associated with a high number and diversity of biological functions, namely polarity establishment, secretory/endocytic pathway functionality, vacuole morphology and wall and membrane composition, structure and maintenance. Phenotypes underlying death, morphogenesis and differentiation are also included. Paracrine signalling, like the one promoted by the Hh pathway, has not been shown to occur in microbial communities, despite the fact that large aggregates of cells like biofilms or colonies behave as proto-tissues. Instead, these have been suggested to sense the population density through the secretion of quorum-sensing chemicals. This review focuses on Gup1/HHATL and Gup2/HHAT proteins. We review the functions and physiology associated with these proteins in yeasts and higher eukaryotes. We suggest standardisation of the presently chaotic Gup-related nomenclature, which includes KIAA117, c3orf3, RASP, Skinny, Sightless and Central Missing, in order to avoid the disclosure of otherwise unnoticed information."
"Heart attacks affect more than seven million people worldwide each year. A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, may result in the death of a billion cardiomyocytes within hours. The adult mammalian heart does not have an effective mechanism to replace lost cardiomyocytes. Instead, lost muscle is replaced with scar tissue, which decreases blood pumping ability and leads to heart failure over time. Here, we report that the loss of the chromatin factor ASXL2 results in spontaneous proliferation and cardiogenic differentiation of a subset of interstitial non-cardiomyocytes. The adultAsxl2-/-heart displays spontaneous overgrowth without cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Thymidine analog labeling and Ki67 staining of 12-week-old hearts revealed 3- and 5-fold increases of proliferation rate for vimentin? non-cardiomyocytes inAsxl2-/-over age- and sex-matched wildtype controls, respectively. Approximately 10% of proliferating non-cardiomyocytes in theAsxl2-/-heart express the cardiogenic marker NKX2-5, a frequency that is ~7-fold higher than that observed in the wildtype. EdU lineage tracing experiments showed that ~6% of pulsed-labeled non-cardiomyocytes inAsxl2-/-hearts differentiate into mature cardiomyocytes after a four-week chase, a phenomenon not observed for similarly pulse-chased wildtype controls. Taken together, these data indicate de novo cardiomyocyte production in theAsxl2-/-heart due to activation of a population of proliferative cardiogenic non-cardiomyocytes. Our study suggests the existence of an epigenetic barrier to cardiogenicity in the adult heart and raises the intriguing possibility of unlocking regenerative potential via transient modulation of epigenetic activity."
"Recent studies revealed new insights into the development of a unique caudal forebrain-signaling center: thezona limitans intrathalamica(zli). Thezliis the last brain signaling center to form and the first forebrain compartment to be established. It is the only part of the dorsal neural tube expressing the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) whose activity participates in the survival, growth and patterning of neuronal progenitor subpopulations within the thalamic complex. Here, we review the gene regulatory network of transcription factors andcis-regulatory elements that underlies formation of ashh-expressing delimitated domain in the anterior brain. We discuss evidence that this network predates the origin of chordates. We highlight the contribution of Shh, Wnt and Notch signaling tozlidevelopment and discuss implications for the fact that the morphogen Shh relies on primary cilia for signal transduction. The network that underlieszlidevelopment also contributes to thalamus induction, and to its patterning once thezlihas been set up. We present an overview of the brain malformations possibly associated with developmental defects in this gene regulatory network (GRN)."
"The Hedgehog morphogen aroused an enormous interest since it was characterized as an essential signal for ventral patterning of the spinal cord two decades ago. The pathway is notably implicated in the initial appearance of the progenitors of oligodendrocytes (OPCs), the glial cells of the central nervous system which after maturation are responsible for axon myelination. In accordance with the requirement for Hedgehog signaling in ventral patterning, the earliest identifiable cells in the oligodendrocyte lineage are derived from the ventral ventricular zone of the developing spinal cord and brain. Here, we present the current knowledge about the involvement of Hedgehog signaling in the strict spatial and temporal regulation which characterizes the initiation and progression of the oligodendrocyte lineage. We notably describe the ability of the Hedgehog signaling to tightly orchestrate the appearance of specific combinations of genes in concert with other pathways. We document the molecular mechanisms controlling Hedgehog temporal activity during OPC specification. The contribution of the pathway to aspects of OPC development different from their specification is also highlighted especially in the optic nerve. Finally, we report the data demonstrating that Hedgehog signaling-dependency is not a universal situation for oligodendrocyte generation as evidenced in the dorsal spinal cord in contrast to the dorsal forebrain."
"The Hedgehog signalling pathway is evolutionarily highly conserved and essential for embryonic development of invertebrates and vertebrates. Consequently, impaired Hedgehog signalling results in very severe human diseases, ranging from holoprosencephaly to Pallister-Hall syndrome. Due to this great importance for human health, the focus of numerous research groups is placed on the investigation of the detailed mechanisms underlying Hedgehog signalling. Today, it is known that tiny cell protrusions, known as primary cilia, are necessary to mediate Hedgehog signalling in vertebrates. Although the Hedgehog pathway is one of the best studied signalling pathways, many questions remain. One of these questions is: How do primary cilia control Hedgehog signalling in vertebrates? Recently, it was shown that primary cilia regulate a special kind of proteasome which is essential for proper Hedgehog signalling. This review article will cover this novel cilia-proteasome association in embryonic Hedgehog signalling and discuss the possibilities provided by future investigations on this topic."
"Loss or damage of cortical inhibitory interneurons characterizes a number of neurological disorders. There is therefore a great deal of interest in learning how to generate these neurons from a pluripotent stem cell source so they can be used for cell replacement therapies or for in vitro drug testing. To design a directed differentiation protocol, a number of groups have used the information gained in the last 15 years detailing the conditions that promote interneuron progenitor differentiation in the ventral telencephalon during embryogenesis. The use of Hedgehog peptides and agonists is featured prominently in these approaches. We review here the data documenting a role for Hedgehog in specifying interneurons in both the embryonic brain during development and in vitro during the directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells."
"                    Hoxa2
is an evolutionarily conserved developmental regulatory gene that functions to specify rhombomere (r) and pharyngeal arch (PA) identities throughout the Osteichthyes. Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes)hoxa2a,like orthologousHoxa2genes from other osteichthyans, is expressed during embryogenesis in r2-7 and PA2-7, whereas the paralogous medaka pseudogene,?hoxa2b, is expressed in noncanonicalHoxa2domains, including the pectoral fin buds. To understand the evolution ofcis-regulatory element (CRE) control of gene expression, we conducted eGFP reporter gene expression studies with extensive functional mapping of several conserved CREs upstream of medakahoxa2aand?hoxa2bin transient and stable-line transgenic medaka embryos. The CREs tested were previously shown to contribute to directing mouseHoxa2gene expression in r3, r5, and PA2-4. Our results reveal the presence of sequence elements embedded in the medakahoxa2aand?hoxa2bupstream enhancer regions (UERs) that mediate expression in r4 and the PAs (hoxa2ar4/CNCC element) or in r3-7 and the PAs?hoxa2br3-7/CNCC element), respectively. Further, these elements were shown to be highly conserved among osteichthyans, which suggests that the r4 specifying element embedded in the UER ofHoxa2is a deeply rooted rhombomere specifying element and the activity of this element has been modified by the evolution of flanking sequences that redirect its activity to alternative developmental compartments."
"A critical position in the developmental hierarchy is occupied by theHoxgenes, which encode transcription factors.Hoxgenes are crucial in specifying regional identity along the embryonic axes and in regulating morphogenesis. In mouse, targeted mutations ofHoxgenes cause skeletal transformations and organ defects that can impair viability. Here, we present the current knowledge about theHoxa5gene, a paradigm for the function and the regulation ofHoxgenes. The phenotypic survey ofHoxa5-/-mice has unveiled its critical role in the regional specification of the skeleton and in organogenesis. MostHoxa5-/-mice die at birth from respiratory distress due to tracheal and lung dysmorphogenesis and impaired diaphragm innervation. The severity of the phenotype establishes thatHoxa5plays a predominant role in lung organogenesisversusotherHoxgenes.Hoxa5also governs digestive tract morphogenesis, thyroid and mammary glands development, and ovary homeostasis. DeregulatedHoxa5expression is reported in cancers, indicatingHoxa5involvement in tumor predisposition and progression. The dynamicHoxa5expression profile is under the transcriptional control of multiplecis-acting sequences andtrans-acting regulators. It is also modulated by epigenetic mechanisms, implicating chromatin modifications and microRNAs. Finally, lncRNAs originating from alternative splicing and distal promoters encompass theHoxa5locus."
"Aquaporins are membrane channel proteins ubiquitously present in all kingdoms of life. Although aquaporins were originally discovered as water channels, their roles in the transport of small neutral solutes, gasses, and metal ions are now well established. Plants contain the largest number and greatest diversity of aquaporin homologs with diverse subcellular localization patterns, gating properties, and solute specificity. The roles of aquaporins in physiological functions throughout plant growth and development are well known. As an integral regulator of plant-water relations, they are presumed to play an important role in plant defense responses against biotic and abiotic stressors. This review highlights involvement of various aquaporin homologs in plant stress responses against a variety of environmental stresses that disturb plant cell osmotic balance and nutrient homeostasis."
"Phylogenetic methods are key to providing models for how a given protein family evolved. However, these methods run into difficulties when sequence divergence is either too low or too high. Here, we provide a case study of Hox and ParaHox proteins so that additional insights can be gained using a new computational approach to help solve old classification problems. For two (Gsx and Cdx) out of three ParaHox proteins the assignments differ between the currently most established view and four alternative scenarios. We use a non-phylogenetic, pairwise-sequence-similarity-based method to assess which of the previous predictions, if any, are best supported by the sequence-similarity relationships between Hox and ParaHox proteins. The overall sequence-similarities show Gsx to be most similar to Hox2-3, and Cdx to be most similar to Hox4-8. The results indicate that a purely pairwise-sequence-similarity-based approach can provide additional information not only when phylogenetic inference methods have insufficient information to provide reliable classifications (as was shown previously for central Hox proteins), but also when the sequence variation is so high that the resulting phylogenetic reconstructions are likely plagued by long-branch-attraction artifacts."
"The epidemic of heart disease, the leading cause of death worldwide, is made worse by the fact that the adult mammalian heart is especially poor at repair. Damage to the mammal heart-such as that caused by myocardial infarction-leads to scarring, resulting in cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. In contrast, the hearts of fish and urodele amphibians are capable of complete regeneration of cardiac tissue from multiple types of damage, with full restoration of functionality. In the last decades, research has revealed a wealth of information on how these animals are able to perform this remarkable feat, and non-mammalian models of heart repair have become a burgeoning new source of data on the morphological, cellular, and molecular processes necessary to heal cardiac damage. In this review we present the major findings from recent research on the underlying mechanisms of fish and amphibian heart regeneration. We also discuss the tools and techniques that have been developed to answer these important questions."
"While it is well established that climate change affects species distributions and abundances, the impacts of climate change on species interactions has not been extensively studied. This is particularly important for specialists whose interactions are tightly linked, such as between the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and the plant genus Asclepias, on which it depends. We used open-top chambers (OTCs) to increase temperatures in experimental plots and placed either nonnative Asclepias curassavica or native A. incarnata in each plot along with monarch larvae. We found, under current climatic conditions, adult monarchs had higher survival and mass when feeding on A. curassavica. However, under future conditions, monarchs fared much worse on A. curassavica. The decrease in adult survival and mass was associated with increasing cardenolide concentrations under warmer temperatures. Increased temperatures alone reduced monarch forewing length. Cardenolide concentrations in A. curassavica may have transitioned from beneficial to detrimental as temperature increased. Thus, the increasing cardenolide concentrations may have pushed the larvae over a tipping point into an ecological trap; whereby past environmental cues associated with increased fitness give misleading information. Given the ubiquity of specialist plant-herbivore interactions, the potential for such ecological traps to emerge as temperatures increase may have far-reaching consequences."
"Among the proteins predicted to be a part of the DExD box RNA helicase family, the functions of DDX49 are unknown. Here, we characterize the enzymatic activities and functions of DDX49 by comparing its properties with the well-studied RNA helicase, DDX39B. We find that DDX49 exhibits a robust ATPase and RNA helicase activity, significantly higher than that of DDX39B. DDX49 is required for the efficient export of poly (A)+ RNA from nucleus in a splicing-independent manner. Furthermore, DDX49 is a resident protein of nucleolus and regulates the steady state levels of pre-ribosomal RNA by regulating its transcription and stability. These dual functions of regulating mRNA export and pre-ribosomal RNA levels enable DDX49 to modulate global translation. Phenotypically, DDX49 promotes proliferation and colony forming potential of cells. Strikingly, DDX49 is significantly elevated in diverse cancer types suggesting that the increased abundance of DDX49 has a role in oncogenic transformation of cells. Taken together, this study shows the physiological role of DDX49 in regulating distinct steps of mRNA and pre-ribosomal RNA metabolism and hence translation and potential pathological role of its dysregulation, especially in cancers."
"Cellular metabolism can influence host immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Using a systems biology approach, differential expression of 292 metabolic genes involved in glycolysis, glutathione, pyrimidine and inositol phosphate pathways was evident at the site of a human tuberculin skin test challenge in patients with active tuberculosis infection. For 28 metabolic genes, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were trans-acting for in vitro cytokine responses to Mtb stimulation, including glutathione and pyrimidine metabolism genes that alter production of Th1 and Th17 cytokines. Our findings identify novel therapeutic targets in host metabolism that may shape protective immunity to tuberculosis."
"Accurate reconstruction of ancestral states is a critical evolutionary analysis when studying ancient proteins and comparing biochemical properties between parental or extinct species and their extant relatives. It relies on multiple sequence alignment (MSA) which may introduce biases, and it remains unknown how MSA methodological approaches impact ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR). Here, we investigate how MSA methodology modulates ASR using a simulation study of various evolutionary scenarios. We evaluate the accuracy of ancestral protein sequence reconstruction for simulated data and compare reconstruction outcomes using different alignment methods. Our results reveal biases introduced not only by aligner algorithms and assumptions, but also tree topology and the rate of insertions and deletions. Under many conditions we find no substantial differences between the MSAs. However, increasing the difficulty for the aligners can significantly impact ASR. The MAFFT consistency aligners and PRANK variants exhibit the best performance, while FSA displays limited performance. We also discover a bias towards reconstructed sequences longer than the true ancestors, deriving from a preference for inferring insertions, in almost all MSA methodological approaches. In addition, we find measures of MSA quality generally correlate highly with reconstruction accuracy. Thus, we show MSA methodological differences can affect the quality of reconstructions and propose MSA methods should be selected with care to accurately determine ancestral states with confidence."
"The success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis relies on the ability to switch between active growth and non-replicating persistence, associated with latent TB infection. Resuscitation promoting factors (Rpfs) are essential for the transition between these states. Rpf expression is tightly regulated as these enzymes are able to degrade the cell wall, and hence potentially lethal to the bacterium itself. We have identified a regulatory element in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of rpfB. We demonstrate that this element is a transcriptionally regulated RNA switch/riboswitch candidate, which appears to be restricted to pathogenic mycobacteria, suggesting a role in virulence. We have used translation start site mapping to re-annotate the RpfB start codon and identified and validated a ribosome binding site that is likely to be targeted by an rpfB antisense RNA. Finally, we show that rpfB is co-transcribed with ksgA and ispE downstream. ksgA encodes a universally conserved methyltransferase involved in ribosome maturation and ispE encodes an essential kinase involved in cell wall synthesis. This arrangement implies co-regulation of resuscitation, cell wall synthesis and ribosome maturation via the RNA switch."
"Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) is a vector of several arboviruses impacting human health, including dengue, chikungunya, and potentially Zika. Vector control strategies that deploy modified males into the field are in use or under development and require a solid understanding of male biology; unfortunately, there has been limited effort to understand male Ae. albopictus reproductive biology, including sperm production and capacity. We tested whether body size and age affect spermatogenesis in Ae. albopictus. In general, older and larger males produced more sperm than their younger or smaller counterparts. Large males continued spermatogenesis well after 10-d post-eclosion (dpe), augmenting their reserves by 39%. By contrast, small males stopped producing sperm at 10 dpe. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of Ae. albopictus reproductive physiology. We discuss the usefulness of these findings in the context of Ae. albopictus life history and their utility in optimizing male mosquito release strategies."
"The existence of tethering tracts in spinal dysraphism, other than congenital dermal sinus (CDS), has been recognized and has been summated into an integrated concept of limited dorsal myeloschisis (LDM).To elucidate the underlying embryology of LDM in relation to CDS by focusing on the pathological features of special cases of tethering tracts.Out of 389 spinal dysraphism patients who were operated on from 2010 to 2016, 5 patients who had tethering tracts composed of both CDS and LDM (or ""probable LDM"" if only fibrous tissue was found) were identified. Their clinical presentation, radiological images, operative findings, and pathology were thoroughly reviewed.Three nonsaccular-type patients harbored stalks in which the squamous epithelial lined sinus (CDS) was found in the distal portion, and fibroneural (LDM) or fibrous (probable LDM) tissue in the proximal part. Two patients had saccular lesions, and a stalk was found inside the sac, connecting a small pit on the skin to the spinal cord. The tracts were pathologically identical to a CDS.This study reports the coexistence of CDS and LDM (or probable LDM) components. These unique cases support the hypothesis that the CDS and LDM are among a spectrum of an anomaly that is caused by failure of complete dysjunction between cutaneous and neural ectoderms. Neurosurgeons should be aware of the possibility of coexisting ""CDS"" components in cases suggestive of LDM. In such cases, not only untethering but also meticulous removal of the squamous epithelium is critical."
"A total of 105 independent Candida albicans strains isolated from patients in Iran were investigated. According to CLSI documents M27-A3 and M27-S4, the 24 h geometric mean MICs of caspofungin, itraconazole, and fluconazole were 0.27, 3.19, and 11.91 ?g/ml, respectively. Microsatellites analysis of CEF3, CAIII, LOC4 Loci identified 93 different allelic genotypes clustered apart into six different clades. Antifungal susceptibility was not linked with the source of isolation and the corresponding genotype of C. albicans strains."
"The mucin-type O-glycome in cancer aberrantly expresses the truncated glycans Tn (GalNAc?1-Ser/Thr) and STn (Neu5Ac?2,6GalNAc?1Ser/Thr). However, the role of Tn and STn in cancer and other diseases is not well understood. Our recent discovery of the self-binding properties (carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions) of Tn (Tn - Tn) and STn (STn - STn) provides a model for their possible roles in cellular transformation. We also review evidence that Tn and STn are members of a larger family of glycan tumor antigens that possess carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions, which may participate in oncogenesis."
"Previously it was shown that UV irradiation induces a strong upregulation of tfb3 coding for a paralog of the archaeal transcriptional factor B (TFB) in Sulfolobus solfataricus, a crenarchaea. To investigate the function of this gene in DNA damage response (DDR), tfb3 was inactivated by gene deletion in Sulfolobus islandicus and the resulting ?tfb3 was more sensitive to DNA damage agents than the original strain. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a large set of genes show TFB3-dependent activation, including genes of the ups operon and ced system. Furthermore, the TFB3 protein was found to be associated with DDR gene promoters and functional dissection of TFB3 showed that the conserved Zn-ribbon and coiled-coil motif are essential for the activation. Together, the results indicated that TFB3 activates the expression of DDR genes by interaction with other transcriptional factors at the promoter regions of DDR genes to facilitate the formation of transcription initiation complex. Strikingly, TFB3 and Ced systems are present in a wide range of crenarchaea, suggesting that the Ced system function as a primary DNA damage repair mechanism in Crenarchaeota. Our findings further suggest that TFB3 and the concurrent TFB1 form a TFB3-dependent DNA damage-responsive circuit with their target genes, which is evolutionarily conserved in the major lineage of Archaea."
"The metabolic properties of cells are formed under the influence of environmental factors such as nutrients and hormones. Although such a metabolic program is likely initiated through epigenetic mechanisms, the direct links between metabolic cues and activities of chromatin modifiers remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) controls the metabolic program in myogenic differentiation, under the action of catabolic hormone, glucocorticoids. By using transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches, we revealed that LSD1 bound to oxidative metabolism and slow-twitch myosin genes, and repressed their expression. Consistent with this, loss of LSD1 activity during differentiation enhanced the oxidative capacity of myotubes. By testing the effects of various hormones, we found that LSD1 levels were decreased by treatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) in cultured myoblasts and in skeletal muscle from mice. Mechanistically, glucocorticoid signaling induced expression of a ubiquitin E3 ligase, JADE-2, which was responsible for proteasomal degradation of LSD1. Consequently, in differentiating myoblasts, chemical inhibition of LSD1, in combination with Dex treatment, synergistically de-repressed oxidative metabolism genes, concomitant with increased histone H3 lysine 4 methylation at these loci. These findings demonstrated that LSD1 serves as an epigenetic regulator linking glucocorticoid action to metabolic programming during myogenic differentiation."
"The lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum Linnaeus (Ixodida: Ixodidae), is emerging as an important human disease vector in the United States. While some recent studies have modeled broad-scale (regional or county-level) distribution patterns of A. americanum, less is known about how local-scale habitat characteristics drive A. americanum abundance. Such local-scale information is vital to identify targets for tick population control measures within land management units. We investigated how habitat features predict host-seeking A. americanum adult and nymph abundance within a 12-ha oak-hickory forest plot in the Missouri Ozarks. We trapped ticks using CO2-baited traps at 40 evenly spaced locations for three 24-h periods during the summer of 2015, and we measured biotic and abiotic variables surrounding each location. Of 2,008 A. americanum captured, 1,009 were nymphs, and 999 were adults. We observed spatial heterogeneity in local tick abundance (min = 0 ticks, max = 112 ticks, mean = 16.7 ticks per trap night). Using generalized linear mixed models, we found that both nymphs and adults had greater abundance in valleys as well as on northern-facing aspects. Moreover, nymph abundance was negatively related to temperature variance, while adult abundance had a negative relationship with elevation. These results demonstrate that managers in this region may be able to predict local tick abundance through simple physiognomic factors and use these parameters for targeted management action."
"5' mediated cytoplasmic RNA decay is a conserved cellular process in eukaryotes. While the functions of the structured core domains in this pathway are well-studied, the role of abundant intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) is lacking. Here we reconstitute the Dcp1:Dcp2 complex containing a portion of the disordered C-terminus and show its activity is autoinhibited by linear interaction motifs. Enhancers of decapping (Edc) 1 and 3 cooperate to activate decapping by different mechanisms: Edc3 alleviates autoinhibition by binding IDRs and destabilizing an inactive form of the enzyme, whereas Edc1 stabilizes the transition state for catalysis. Both activators are required to fully stimulate an autoinhibited Dcp1:Dcp2 as Edc1 alone cannot overcome the decrease in activity attributed to the C-terminal extension. Our data provide a mechanistic framework for combinatorial control of decapping by protein cofactors, a principle that is likely conserved in multiple 5' mRNA decay pathways."
"Understanding plant evolution and diversity in a phylogenomic context is an enormous challenge due, in part, to limited availability of genome-scale data across phylodiverse species. The 10KP (10,000 Plants) Genome Sequencing Project will sequence and characterize representative genomes from every major clade of embryophytes, green algae, and protists (excluding fungi) within the next 5 years. By implementing and continuously improving leading-edge sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, 10KP will catalogue the genome content of plant and protist diversity and make these data freely available as an enduring foundation for future scientific discoveries and applications. 10KP is structured as an international consortium, open to the global community, including botanical gardens, plant research institutes, universities, and private industry. Our immediate goal is to establish a policy framework for this endeavor, the principles of which are outlined here."
"Hummingbirds oxidize ingested nectar sugars directly to fuel foraging but cannot sustain this fuel use during fasting periods, such as during the night or during long-distance migratory flights. Instead, fasting hummingbirds switch to oxidizing stored lipids that are derived from ingested sugars. The hummingbird liver plays a key role in moderating energy homeostasis and this remarkable capacity for fuel switching. Additionally, liver is the principle location of de novo lipogenesis, which can occur at exceptionally high rates, such as during premigratory fattening. Yet understanding how this tissue and whole organism moderates energy turnover is hampered by a lack of information regarding how relevant enzymes differ in sequence, expression, and regulation.We generated a de novo transcriptome of the hummingbird liver using PacBio full-length cDNA sequencing (Iso-Seq), yielding 8.6Gb of sequencing data, or 2.6M reads from 4 different size fractions. We analyzed data using the SMRTAnalysis v3.1 Iso-Seq pipeline, then clustered isoforms into gene families to generate de novo gene contigs using Cogent. We performed orthology analysis to identify closely related sequences between our transcriptome and other avian and human gene sets. Finally, we closely examined homology of critical lipid metabolism genes between our transcriptome data and avian and human genomes.We confirmed high levels of sequence divergence within hummingbird lipogenic enzymes, suggesting a high probability of adaptive divergent function in the hepatic lipogenic pathways. Our results leverage cutting-edge technology and a novel bioinformatics pipeline to provide a first direct look at the transcriptome of this incredible organism."
"Effective male fruit fly attractants, such as cue lure (CL) and methyl eugenol (ME), are important in the monitoring and management of pest species through lure and kill techniques of trapping and male annihilation. However, some species are only weakly responsive to these lures, making their detection and control difficult. Zeugodacus diversus (Coquillett), a pest of cucurbit flowers in Asia, is weakly attracted to ME. Recently in Australia and Papua New Guinea, the eugenol analogues isoeugenol, methyl-isoeugenol, and dihydroeugenol were found to be effective attractants for species with a weak response to ME and CL, as well as several nonresponsive species. Additionally, studies from the early 1900s indicated that Z. diversus was attracted to isoeugenol. To determine if these eugenol analogues may be more effective attractants for Z. diversus, we field tested them in Bangladesh in comparison to ME, as well as CL and zingerone. Z. diversus was significantly more attracted to all three eugenol analogues than ME, with it most attracted to methyl-isoeugenol. Its attraction to methyl-isoeugenol was 49 times greater than its attraction to ME (respective means 23.58 flies/trap/day (FTD) and 0.48 FTD). Z. diversus was also consistently trapped at methyl-isoeugenol at all trap clearances including when populations were low, whereas it was only trapped at ME at 6 out of the 13 clearances. This study demonstrates that methyl-isoeugenol is a highly attractive lure for Z. diversus and would be a valuable inclusion as an attractant in monitoring and male annihilation programs."
"Delivery of miniaturized dystrophin genes via adeno-associated viral vectors is one leading approach in development to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here we directly compared the functionality of five mini- and micro-dystrophins via skeletal muscle-specific transgenic expression in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. We evaluated their ability to rescue defects in the microtubule network, passive stiffness, and contractility of skeletal muscle. Transgenic mdx mice expressing the short dystrophin isoform Dp116 served as a negative control. All mini- and micro-dystrophins restored elevated detyrosinated tubulin and microtubule density of mdx muscle to values not different from C57BL/10, however, only mini-dystrophins restored the transverse component of the microtubule lattice back to C57BL/10. Passive stiffness values in mdx muscles expressing mini- or micro-dystrophins were not different from C57BL/10. While all mini- and micro-dystrophins conferred significant protection from eccentric contraction-induced force loss in vivo and ex vivo compared to mdx, removal of repeats 2 and 3 resulted in less protection from force drop caused by eccentric contraction ex vivo. Our data reveal subtle yet significant differences in the relative functionalities for different therapeutic constructs of miniaturized dystrophin in terms of protection from ex vivo eccentric contraction induced force loss and restoration of an organized microtubule lattice."
"Can subphenotype analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from subjects with testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) provide insight into cryptorchidism (undescended testis, UDT) susceptibility?Suggestive intragenic GWAS signals common to UDT, TGCT case-case and TGCT case-control analyses occur in genes encoding RBFOX RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their neurodevelopmental targets.UDT is a strong risk factor for TGCT, but while genetic risk factors for TGCT are well-known, genetic susceptibility to UDT is poorly understood and appears to be more complex.We performed a secondary subphenotype analysis of existing GWAS data from the Testicular Cancer Consortium (TECAC) and compared these results with our previously published UDT GWAS data, and with data previously acquired from studies of the fetal rat gubernaculum.Studies from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), United Kingdom (UK) and University of Pennsylvania (Penn) that enrolled white subjects were the source of the TGCT GWAS data. We completed UDT subphenotype case-case (TGCT/UDT vs TGCT/non-UDT) and case-control (TGCT/UDT vs control), collectively referred to as 'TECAC' analyses, followed by a meta-analysis comprising 129 TGCT/UDT cases, 1771 TGCT/non-UDT cases, and 3967 unaffected controls. We reanalyzed our UDT GWAS results comprising 844 cases and 2718 controls by mapping suggestive UDT and TECAC signals (defined as P < 0.001) to genes using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA®). We compared associated pathways and enriched gene categories common to all analyses after Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction, and analyzed transcript levels and protein expression using qRT-PCR and rat fetal gubernaculum confocal imaging, respectively.We found suggestive signals within 19 genes common to all three analyses, including RBFOX1 and RBFOX3, neurodevelopmental paralogs that encode RBPs targeting (U)GCATG-containing transcripts. Ten of the 19 genes participate in neurodevelopment and/or contribute to risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Experimentally predicted RBFOX gene targets were strongly overrepresented among suggestive intragenic signals for the UDT (117 of 628 (19%), P = 3.5 × 10-24), TECAC case-case (129 of 711 (18%), P = 2.5 × 10-27) and TECAC case-control (117 of 679 (17%), P = 2 × 10-21) analyses, and a majority of the genes common to all three analyses (12 of 19 (63%), P = 3 × 10-9) are predicted RBFOX targets. Rbfox1, Rbfox2 and their encoded proteins are expressed in the rat fetal gubernaculum. Predicted RBFOX targets are also enriched among transcripts differentially regulated in the fetal gubernaculum during normal development (P = 3 × 10-31), in response to in vitro hormonal stimulation (P = 5 × 10-45) and in the cryptorchid LE/orl rat (P = 2 × 10-42).GWAS data included in this study are available in the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP accession numbers phs000986.v1.p1 and phs001349.v1p1).These GWAS data did not reach genome-wide significance for any individual analysis. UDT appears to have a complex etiology that also includes environmental factors, and such complexity may require much larger sample sizes than are currently available. The current methodology may also introduce bias that favors false discovery of larger genes.Common suggestive intragenic GWAS signals suggest that RBFOX paralogs and other neurodevelopmental genes are potential UDT risk candidates, and potential TGCT susceptibility modifiers. Enrichment of predicted RBFOX targets among differentially expressed transcripts in the fetal gubernaculum additionally suggests a role for this RBP family in regulation of testicular descent. As RBFOX proteins regulate alternative splicing of Calca to generate calcitonin gene-related peptide, a protein linked to development and function of the gubernaculum, additional studies that address the role of these proteins in UDT are warranted.The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (R01HD060769); National Center for Research Resources (P20RR20173), National Institute of General Medical Sciences (P20GM103464), Nemours Biomedical Research, the Testicular Cancer Consortium (U01CA164947), the Intramural Research Program of the NCI, a support services contract HHSN26120130003C with IMS, Inc., the Abramson Cancer Center at Penn, National Cancer Institute (CA114478), the Institute of Cancer Research, UK and the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) 2.

"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a well-known dominant opportunistic pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF) with a wide range of metabolic capacities. However, P. aeruginosa does not colonize the airways alone, and benefits from the metabolic products of neighboring cells-especially volatile molecules that can travel between different parts of the airways easily. Here, we present a study that investigates the metabolic, gene expression profiles, and phenotypic responses of a P. aeruginosa clinical isolate to fermentation products lactic acid and 2,3-butanediol, metabolites that are produced by facultative anaerobic members of the CF polymicrobial community and potential biomarkers of disease progression. Although previous studies have successfully investigated the metabolic and transcriptional profiles of P. aeruginosa, most have used common lab reference strains that may differ in important ways from clinical isolates. Using transcriptomics and metabolomics with gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry (GCTOF-MS), we observe that fermentation products induce pyocyanin production along with expression of genes involved in P. aeruginosa amino acid utilization, dormancy and aggregative or biofilm modes of growth. These findings have important implications for how interactions within the diverse CF microbial community influence microbial physiology, with potential clinical consequences."
"Methane (CH4) is one of the most abundant greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and identification of its sources and sinks is crucial for the reliability of climate model outputs. Although CH4 production and consumption rates have been reported from a broad spectrum of environments, data obtained from glacier forefields are restricted to a few locations. We report the activities of methanotrophic communities and their diversity along a chronosequence in front of a sub-Arctic glacier using high-throughput sequencing and gas flux measurements. CH4 oxidation rates were measured in the field throughout the growing season during three sampling times at eight different sampling points in combination with laboratory incubation experiments. The overall results showed that the methanotrophic community had similar trends of increased CH4 consumption and increased abundance as a function of soil development and time of year. Sequencing results revealed that the methanotrophic community was dominated by a few OTUs and that a short-term increase in CH4 concentration, as performed in the field measurements, altered slightly the relative abundance of the OTUs."
"Batch effects are one of the major source of technical variations that affect the measurements in high-throughput studies such as RNA sequencing. It has been well established that batch effects can be caused by different experimental platforms, laboratory conditions, different sources of samples and personnel differences. These differences can confound the outcomes of interest and lead to spurious results. A critical input for batch correction algorithms is the knowledge of batch factors, which in many cases are unknown or inaccurate. Hence, the primary motivation of our paper is to detect hidden batch factors that can be used in standard techniques to accurately capture the relationship between gene expression and other modeled variables of interest.We introduce a new algorithm based on data-adaptive shrinkage and semi-Non-negative Matrix Factorization for the detection of unknown batch effects. We test our algorithm on three different datasets: (i) Sequencing Quality Control, (ii) Topotecan RNA-Seq and (iii) Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) on Glioblastoma Multiforme. We have demonstrated a superior performance in identifying hidden batch effects as compared to existing algorithms for batch detection in all three datasets. In the Topotecan study, we were able to identify a new batch factor that has been missed by the original study, leading to under-representation of differentially expressed genes. For scRNA-Seq, we demonstrated the power of our method in detecting subtle batch effects.DASC R package is available via Bioconductor or at https://github.com/zhanglabNKU/DASC.zhanghan@nankai.edu.cn or zhandonl@bcm.edu.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
"Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) is a neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. NPC1 is associated with neuroinflammation; however, attempts to therapeutically target neuroinflammation in NPC1 have had mixed success. We show here that NPC1 neuroinflammation is characterized by an atypical microglia activation phenotype. Specifically, Npc1-/- microglia demonstrated altered morphology, reduced levels of lineage markers and a shift towards glycolytic metabolism. Treatment with 2-hydroxypropyl-?-cyclodextrin (HP?CD), a drug currently being studied in a phase 3 clinical trial, reversed all microglia-associated defects in Npc1-/- animals. In addition, impairing microglia mediated neuroinflammation by genetic deletion of IRF8 led to decreased symptoms and increased lifespan. We identified CD22 as a marker of dysregulated microglia in Npc1 mutant mice and subsequently demonstrated that elevated cerebrospinal fluid levels of CD22 in NPC1 patients responds to HP?CD administration. Collectively, these data provide the first in-depth analysis of microglia function in NPC1 and suggests possible new therapeutic approaches."
"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to the accumulation of highthroughput sequence data from various organisms in biology. To apply gene annotation of organellar genomes for various organisms, more optimized tools for functional gene annotation are required. Almost all gene annotation tools are mainly focused on the chloroplast genome of land plants or the mitochondrial genome of animals.We have developed a web application AGORA for the fast, user-friendly, and improved annotations of organellar genomes. AGORA annotates genes based on a BLAST-based homology search and clustering with selected reference sequences from the NCBI database or user-defined uploaded data. AGORA can annotate the functional genes in almost all mitochondrion and plastid genomes of eukaryotes. The gene annotation of a genome with an exon-intron structure within a gene or inverted repeat region is also available. It provides information of start and end positions of each gene, BLAST results compared with the reference sequence, and visualization of gene map by OGDRAW.Users can freely use the software, and the accessible URL is https://bigdata.dongguk.edu/gene_project/AGORA/.The main module of the tool is implemented by the python and php, and the web page is built by the HTML and CSS to support all browsers.gangman@dongguk.edu."
"Simulation is a critical part of method development and assessment. With the increasing sophistication of multi-trait and multi-locus genetic analysis techniques, it is important that the community has flexible simulation tools to challenge and explore the properties of these methods.We have developed PhenotypeSimulator, a comprehensive phenotype simulation scheme which can model multiple traits with multiple underlying genetic loci as well as complex covariate and observational noise structure. This package has been designed to work with many common genetic tools both for input and output. We describe the underlying components of this simulation tool and illustrate its use on an example dataset.PhenotypeSimulator is available as a well documented R/CRAN package and the code is available on github: https://github.com/HannahVMeyer/PhenotypeSimulator.hannah@ebi.ac.uk.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
"Mass spectrometry (MS) based quantification of proteins/peptides has become a powerful tool in biological research with high sensitivity and throughput. The accuracy of quantification, however, has been problematic as not all peptides are suitable for quantification. Several methods and tools have been developed to identify peptides that response well in mass spectrometry and they are mainly based on predictive models, and rarely consider the linearity of the response curve, limiting the accuracy and applicability of the methods. An alternative solution is to select empirically superior peptides that offer satisfactory MS response intensity and linearity in a wide dynamic range of peptide concentration.We constructed a reference database for proteome quantification based on experimental mass spectrum response curves. The intensity and dynamic range of over 2,647,773 transitions from 121,318 peptides were obtained from a set of dilution experiments, covering 11,040 gene products. These transitions and peptides were evaluated and presented in a database named SCRIPT-MAP. We showed that the best-responder (BR) peptide approach for quantification based on SCRIPT-MAP database is robust, repeatable, and accurate in proteome-scale protein quantification. This study provides a reference database as well as a peptides/transitions selection method for quantitative proteomics.SCRIPT-MAP database is available at http://www.firmiana.org/responders/.chend@fudan.edu.cn or jqin@bcm.edu.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
"The affordability of DNA sequencing has led to the generation of unprecedented volumes of raw sequencing data. These data must be stored, processed, and transmitted, which poses significant challenges. To facilitate this effort, we introduce FaStore, a specialized compressor for FASTQ files. FaStore does not use any reference sequences for compression, and permits the user to choose from several lossy modes to improve the overall compression ratio, depending on the specific needs.FaStore in the lossless mode achieves a significant improvement in compression ratio with respect to previously proposed algorithms. We perform an analysis on the effect that the different lossy modes have on variant calling, the most widely used application for clinical decision making, especially important in the era of precision medicine. We show that lossy compression can offer significant compression gains, while preserving the essential genomic information and without affecting the variant calling performance.FaStore can be downloaded from https://github.com/refresh-bio/FaStore.sebastian.deorowicz@polsl.pl.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
"The rice white tip nematode (RWTN) Aphelenchoides besseyi is a migratory plant parasitic nematode that infects the aboveground parts of plants. Fatty acid- and retinoid-binding (FAR) proteins are nematode-specific proteins that are involved in many important biological processes. Genes encoding FAR proteins have been identified in many species of nematodes, which indicated that nematodes may produce more than one type of FAR protein. The main goal of this study is to find new molecular targets including new far genes that will help control RWTN, and reduce the economic damage caused by RWTN.Two RWTN populations with different levels of pathogenicity and reproduction were sequenced and analysed with next-generation sequencing. 17,087 transcripts were annotated using six databases and 1,696 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the two RWTN populations. Seven new Ab-far genes were identified from the transcriptome data of the two RWTN populations which is the first to identify multiple far genes in plant parasitic nematodes. This study is the first to identify far genes in the nervous system of nematodes and the first to report a transcriptome sequencing analysis of different RWTN populations. The results help elucidate the genes related to parasitism and pathogenicity and also contribute to the identification of new target genes and development of new methods to control RWTN.Our data are publicly available at Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database and GenBank database.xiehui@scau.edu.cn.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
"the complex and progressive nature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and cognitive impairment may necessitate a care provider, a role which is frequently undertaken by a spouse. Providing and receiving care related to dementia impacts on a couple's partnership and may result in decreased intimacy and relationship satisfaction.to explore the changes in long-term intimate relationships in Parkinson's-related dementia, as perceived by spouses providing care to their partners.participants were identified using purposive sampling. Twelve female spouses whose partners had PD and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), PD dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) completed semi-structured face-to-face interviews. Transcribed data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) were applied.couples' relationship satisfaction, intimacy and communication had already reduced in the mild cognitive impairment stage of PD, but the decline in these domains was markedly greater with the emergence of dementia. Increased spousal care responsibilities resulted in partners spending more time together, but feeling emotionally more distanced. Several participants' roles transitioned from spouse to caregiver and they reported feelings of frustration, resentment, anger, sadness and a worry for the future. Cognitive impairment was significantly harder to accept, manage and cope with than the motor symptoms of PD. Spouses acknowledged their marital commitments and exhibited acceptance, adjustment, resilience and various coping strategies.this is the first study exploring relationship satisfaction in Parkinson's-related dementia and has provided valuable insight into the changing patterns of intimate relationships."
"Activation of the nuclear receptor and transcription factor CAR (Nr1i3) by its specific agonist ligand TCPOBOP (1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene) dysregulates hundreds of genes in mouse liver and is linked to male-biased hepatocarcinogenesis. To elucidate the genomic organization of CAR-induced gene responses, we investigated the distribution of TCPOBOP-responsive RefSeq coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes across the megabase-scale topologically associating domains (TADs) that segment the genome, and which provide a structural framework that functionally constrains enhancer-promoter interactions. We show that a subset of TCPOBOP-responsive genes cluster within TADs, and that TCPOBOP-induced genes and TCPOBOP-repressed genes are often found in different TADs. Further, using DNase-seq and DNase hypersensitivity site (DHS) analysis, we identified several thousand genomic regions (?DHS) where short-term exposure to TCPOBOP induces localized changes (increases or decreases) in mouse liver chromatin accessibility, many of which cluster in TADs together with TCPOBOP-responsive genes. Sites of chromatin opening were highly enriched nearby genes induced by TCPOBOP and chromatin closing was highly enriched nearby genes repressed by TCPOBOP, consistent with TCPOBOP-responsive ?DHS serving as enhancers and promoters that positively regulate CAR-responsive genes. Gene expression changes lagged behind chromatin opening or closing for a subset of TCPOBOP-responsive ?DHS. ?DHS that were specifically responsive to TCPOBOP in male liver were significantly enriched for genomic regions with a basal male bias in chromatin accessibility; however, the male-biased response of hepatocellular carcinoma-related genes to TCPOBOP was not associated with a correspondingly male-biased ?DHS response. These studies elucidate the genome-wide organization of CAR-responsive genes and of the thousands of associated genomic sites where TCPOBOP exposure induces both rapid and persistent changes in chromatin accessibility."
"The existence of tethering tracts in spinal dysraphism, other than congenital dermal sinus (CDS), has been recognized and has been summated into an integrated concept of limited dorsal myeloschisis (LDM).To elucidate the underlying embryology of LDM in relation to CDS by focusing on the pathological features of special cases of tethering tracts.Out of 389 spinal dysraphism patients who were operated on from 2010 to 2016, 5 patients who had tethering tracts composed of both CDS and LDM (or ""probable LDM"" if only fibrous tissue was found) were identified. Their clinical presentation, radiological images, operative findings, and pathology were thoroughly reviewed.Three nonsaccular-type patients harbored stalks in which the squamous epithelial lined sinus (CDS) was found in the distal portion, and fibroneural (LDM) or fibrous (probable LDM) tissue in the proximal part. Two patients had saccular lesions, and a stalk was found inside the sac, connecting a small pit on the skin to the spinal cord. The tracts were pathologically identical to a CDS.This study reports the coexistence of CDS and LDM (or probable LDM) components. These unique cases support the hypothesis that the CDS and LDM are among a spectrum of an anomaly that is caused by failure of complete dysjunction between cutaneous and neural ectoderms. Neurosurgeons should be aware of the possibility of coexisting ""CDS"" components in cases suggestive of LDM. In such cases, not only untethering but also meticulous removal of the squamous epithelium is critical."
"Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are the most primitive spermatogonia in the testis and have an essential role to maintain highly productive spermatogenesis by self-renewal and continuous generation of daughter spermatogonia that differentiate into spermatozoa, transmitting genetic information to the next generation. Since the 1950s, many experimental methods, including histology, immunostaining, whole-mount analyses, and pulse-chase labeling had been used in attempts to identify SSCs, but without success. In 1994, a spermatogonial transplantation method was reported that established a quantitative functional assay to identify SSCs by evaluating their ability to both self-renew and differentiate to spermatozoa. The system was originally developed using mice and subsequently extended to non-rodents, including domestic animals and humans. Availability of the functional assay for SSCs has made it possible to develop culture systems for their ex vivo expansion, which dramatically advanced germ cell biology and allowed medical and agricultural applications. In coming years, SSCs will be increasingly used to understand their regulation, as well as in germline modification, including gene correction, enhancement of male fertility, and conversion of somatic cells to biologically competent male germline cells."
"Imidacloprid is a key insecticide used for controlling sucking insect pests, including the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus, Fallén) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), an important agricultural pest of rice. A strain of L. striatellus (YN-ILR) developed 21-fold resistance when selected with imidacloprid on a susceptible YN strain. An in vitro study on piperonyl butoxide synergism indicated that enhanced detoxification mediated by cytochrome P450s contributed to imidacloprid resistance to some extent, and multiple P450 genes showed altered expression in the imidacloprid-resistant YN-ILR strain compared with the susceptible YN strain (CYP425B1-CYP6BD10 had 1.51- to 11.45-fold higher expression, CYP4CE2-CYP4DD1V2 had 0.12- to 0.57-fold lower expression). While there were no mutations in target nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) genes, subunits of Ls?1, Ls?1, and Ls?3 in the YN-ILR strain showed 3.86-, 4.39-, and 2.59-fold higher expression and Lsa8 displayed 0.38-fold lower expression than the YN strain. Moreover, 21-fold moderate imidacloprid resistance in individuals of L. striatellus did not produce a fitness cost. The findings suggest that L. striatellus has the capacity to develop resistance to imidacloprid through P450 detoxification and potential target nAChR expression changes, and moderate imidacloprid resistance was not associated with a fitness cost."
"Mammalian diversification has coincided with a rapid proliferation of various types of non-coding RNAs, including members of both snRNAs and snoRNAs. The significance of this expansion however remains obscure. While some ncRNA copy-number expansions have been linked to functionally tractable effects, such events may equally likely be neutral, perhaps as a result of random retrotransposition. Hindering progress in our understanding of such observations is the difficulty in establishing function for the diverse features that have been identified in our own genome. Projects such as ENCODE and FANTOM have revealed a hidden world of genomic expression patterns, as well as a host of other potential indicators of biological function. However, such projects have been criticised, particularly from practitioners in the field of molecular evolution, where many suspect these data provide limited insight into biological function. The molecular evolution community has largely taken a sceptical view, thus it is important to establish tests of function. We use a range of data, including data drawn from ENCODE and FANTOM, to examine the case for function for the recent copy number expansion in mammals of six evolutionarily ancient RNA families involved in splicing and rRNA maturation. We use several criteria to assess evidence for function: conservation of sequence and structure, genomic synteny, evidence for transposition, and evidence for species-specific expression. Applying these criteria, we find that only a minority of loci show strong evidence for function and that, for the majority, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no function."
"Identifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites (TFBSs) is important in the computational inference of gene regulation. Widely used computational methods of TFBS prediction based on position weight matrices (PWMs) usually have high false positive rates. Moreover, computational studies of transcription regulation in eukaryotes frequently require numerous PWM models of TFBSs due to a large number of TFs involved. To overcome these problems we developed DRAF, a novel method for TFBS prediction that requires only 14 prediction models for 232 human TFs, while at the same time significantly improves prediction accuracy. DRAF models use more features than PWM models, as they combine information from TFBS sequences and physicochemical properties of TF DNA-binding domains into machine learning models. Evaluation of DRAF on 98 human ChIP-seq datasets shows on average 1.54-, 1.96- and 5.19-fold reduction of false positives at the same sensitivities compared to models from HOCOMOCO, TRANSFAC and DeepBind, respectively. This observation suggests that one can efficiently replace the PWM models for TFBS prediction by a small number of DRAF models that significantly improve prediction accuracy. The DRAF method is implemented in a web tool and in a stand-alone software freely available at http://cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/DRAF."
"Engineering mammalian cell lines that stably express many transgenes requires the precise insertion of large amounts of heterologous DNA into well-characterized genomic loci, but current methods are limited. To facilitate reliable large-scale engineering of CHO cells, we identified 21 novel genomic sites that supported stable long-term expression of transgenes, and then constructed cell lines containing one, two or three 'landing pad' recombination sites at selected loci. By using a highly efficient BxB1 recombinase along with different selection markers at each site, we directed recombinase-mediated insertion of heterologous DNA to selected sites, including targeting all three with a single transfection. We used this method to controllably integrate up to nine copies of a monoclonal antibody, representing about 100 kb of heterologous DNA in 21 transcriptional units. Because the integration was targeted to pre-validated loci, recombinant protein expression remained stable for weeks and additional copies of the antibody cassette in the integrated payload resulted in a linear increase in antibody expression. Overall, this multi-copy site-specific integration platform allows for controllable and reproducible insertion of large amounts of DNA into stable genomic sites, which has broad applications for mammalian synthetic biology, recombinant protein production and biomanufacturing."
"?-Lactalbumin is a whey protein that constitutes approximately 22% of the proteins in human milk and approximately 3.5% of those in bovine milk. Within the mammary gland, ?-lactalbumin plays a central role in milk production as part of the lactose synthase complex required for lactose formation, which drives milk volume. It is an important source of bioactive peptides and essential amino acids, including tryptophan, lysine, branched-chain amino acids, and sulfur-containing amino acids, all of which are crucial for infant nutrition. ?-Lactalbumin contributes to infant development, and the commercial availability of ?-lactalbumin allows infant formulas to be reformulated to have a reduced protein content. Likewise, because of its physical characteristics, which include water solubility and heat stability, ?-lactalbumin has the potential to be added to food products as a supplemental protein. It also has potential as a nutritional supplement to support neurological function and sleep in adults, owing to its unique tryptophan content. Other components of ?-lactalbumin that may have usefulness in nutritional supplements include the branched-chain amino acid leucine, which promotes protein accretion in skeletal muscle, and bioactive peptides, which possess prebiotic and antibacterial properties. This review describes the characteristics of ?-lactalbumin and examines the potential applications of ?-lactalbumin for human health."
"We have previously shown that gene expression profiles of oral leukoplakia (OL) may improve the prediction of oral cancer (OC) risk. To identify new targets for prevention, we performed a systematic survey of transcripts associated with an increased risk of oral cancer and overexpressed in OC vs normal mucosa (NM).We used gene expression profiles of 86 patients with OL and available outcomes from a chemoprevention trial of OC and NM. MET expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry in 120 OL patients, and its association with OC development was tested in multivariable analysis. Sensitivity to pharmacological Met inhibition was tested invitro in premalignant and OC cell lines (n?=?33) and invivo using the 4-NQO model of oral chemoprevention (n?=?20 mice per group). All statistical tests were two-sided.The overlap of 693 transcripts associated with an increased risk of OC with 163 transcripts overexpressed in OC compared with NM led to the identification of 23 overlapping transcripts, including MET. MET overexpression in OL was associated with a hazard ratio of 3.84 (95% confidence interval = 1.59 to 9.27, P = .003) of developing OC. Met activation was found in OC and preneoplastic cell lines. Crizotinib activity in preneoplastic and OC cell lines was comparable. ARQ 197 was more active in preneoplastic compared with OC cell lines. In the 4-NQO model, squamous cell carcinoma, dysplasia, and hyperkeratosis were observed in 75.0%, 15.0%, and 10.0% in the control group, and in 25.0%, 70.0%, and 5.0% in the crizotinib group (P < .001).Together, these data suggest that MET activation may represent an early driver in oral premalignancy and a target for chemoprevention of OC."
"Bats have attracted attention in recent years as important reservoirs of viruses deadly to humans and other mammals. These infections are typically nonpathogenic in bats raising questions about innate immune differences that might exist between bats and other mammals. The APOBEC3 gene family encodes antiviral DNA cytosine deaminases with important roles in the suppression of diverse viruses and genomic parasites. Here we characterize pteropid APOBEC3 genes and show that species within the genus Pteropus possess the largest and most diverse array of APOBEC3 genes identified in any mammal reported to date. Several bat APOBEC3 proteins are antiviral as demonstrated by restriction of retroviral infectivity using HIV-1 as a model, and recombinant A3Z1 subtypes possess strong DNA deaminase activity. These genes represent the first group of antiviral restriction factors identified in bats with extensive diversification relative to homologues in other mammals."
"The effects of leaf dorsoventrality and its interaction with environmentally induced changes in the leaf spectral response are still poorly understood, particularly for isobilateral leaves. We investigated the spectral performance of twenty-four genotypes of field-grown durum wheat at two locations under both rainfed and irrigated conditions. Flag leaf reflectance spectra in the VIS-NIR-SWIR regions were recorded in the adaxial and abaxial leaf sides and at the canopy level while traits informing on water status and grain yield were evaluated. Moreover, leaf anatomical parameters were measured in a subset of 5 genotypes.The spectral traits studied were more affected by the leaf side than by the water regime. Leaf dorsoventral differences suggested higher accessory pigment content in the abaxial leaf side while water regime differences were related to increased chlorophyll, nitrogen and water contents in the leaves in the irrigated treatment. These variations were associated with anatomical changes. Additionally, leaf dorsoventral differences were less in the rainfed treatment suggesting the existence of leaf side-specific responses at the anatomical and biochemical level. Finally, the accuracy in yield prediction was enhanced when abaxial leaf spectra were employed. We concluded that the importance of dorsoventrality in spectral traits is paramount, even in isobilateral leaves."
"Identifying the genomic basis underlying local adaptation is paramount to evolutionary biology, and bears many applications in the fields of conservation biology, crop and animal breeding, as well as personalized medicine. While many approaches have been developed to detect signatures of positive selection within single populations and population pairs, the increasing wealth of high-throughput sequencing data requires improved methods capable of handling multiple, and ideally large number of, populations in a single analysis. In this study, we introduce LSD (Levels of exclusively Shared Differences), a fast and flexible framework to perform genome-wide selection scans, along the internal and external branches of a given population tree. We use forward simulations to demonstrate that LSD can identify branches targeted by positive selection with remarkable sensitivity and specificity. We illustrate a range of potential applications by analyzing data from the 1000 Genomes Project and uncover a list of adaptive candidates accompanying the expansion of anatomically modern humans (AMH) out-of-Africa and their spread to Europe."
"The genetic basis of parallel evolution of similar species is of great interest in evolutionary biology. In the adaptive radiation of Lake Victoria cichlid fishes, sister species with either blue or red-back male nuptial coloration have evolved repeatedly, often associated with shallower and deeper water, respectively. One such case are blue and red-backed Pundamilia species, for which we recently showed that a young species pair may have evolved through ""hybrid parallel speciation"". Coalescent simulations suggested that the older species P. pundamilia (blue) and P. nyererei (red-back) admixed in the Mwanza Gulf and that new ""nyererei-like"" and ""pundamilia-like"" species evolved from the admixed population. Here, we use genome scans to study the genomic architecture of differentiation, and assess the influence of hybridization on the evolution of the younger species pair. For each of the two species pairs, we find over 300 genomic regions, widespread across the genome, which are highly differentiated. A subset of the most strongly differentiated regions of the older pair are also differentiated in the younger pair. These shared differentiated regions often show parallel allele frequency differences, consistent with the hypothesis that admixture-derived alleles were targeted by divergent selection in the hybrid population. However, two thirds of the genomic regions that are highly differentiated between the younger species are not highly differentiated between the older species, suggesting independent evolutionary responses to selection pressures. Our analyses reveal how divergent selection on admixture-derived genetic variation can facilitate new speciation events."
"The Fukushima Daiichi accident highlighted the difficulty in making good decisions regarding post-accident actions for the protection of members of the public. Discussions are continuing between the authorities and the residents about 'how safe is safe'. Although governmental officials have argued that 20 mSv per year is a safe level of exposure, many residents have expressed strong doubts, and one of their major concerns is the greater health risk of radiation exposure for children. For settling this controversy, the author has demonstrated risk projections for cancer mortality of female children (0 to 18 years old) resulting from four different levels of radiocaesium deposits on the ground. The results showed that, for female children, the cumulative lifetime attributable risk of cancer mortality due to 18-years external radiation exposure from radiocaesium in soil would be 0.9% for 134Cs and 2.4% for 137Cs for an initial annual dose of 20 mGy/year; when the initial dose was 5 mGy/year, the cumulative lifetime cancer risk would be 0.2% and 0.6% for 134Cs and 137Cs, respectively. These results indicate the critical importance of accurate information about the composition and behavior of major radionuclides released to the environment, as well as precise dose monitoring and risk coefficients, for proper decision-making regarding protective actions for members of the public."
"Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection can cause lower respiratory tract infection in older adults comparable to influenza, but no vaccines are available.This was a randomized, observer blinded first-in-humans study of a novel synthetic RSV antigen SHe, formulated with either the lipid and oil-based vaccine platform, DepoVaxTM, termed DPX-RSV(A), or with alum, termed (RSV(A) SHe, in healthy 50-64-year-old adults. Two dose levels (10 or 25 µg) of the SHe antigen with each formulation were compared to placebo.A booster dose was administered on Day 56.No safety signals were observed. Mild pain, drowsiness and muscles aches were the most common solicited adverse events (AE) which did not increase after dose 2. Robust anti SHe specific immune responses were demonstrated in the DPX-RSV(A) 10µg and 25µg groups (GMTR ~10 fold > placebo at day 56 and ~100 fold > placebo at day 236) and sustained at day 421 days in the DPX-RSV (A) 25 µg) group. Responses to Alum-adjuvanted vaccines were very low.A novel RSV antigen from the SH protein of RSV, formulated in a lipid and oil-based vaccine platform was highly immunogenic, with sustained antigen-specific antibody responses and had an acceptable safety profile."
"Genes that are inherently subject to strong selective constraints tend to be overretained in duplicate after polyploidy. They also continue to experience similar, but somewhat relaxed, constraints after that polyploidy event. We sought to assess for how long the influence of polyploidy is felt on these genes' selective pressures. We analyzed two nested polyploidy events in Brassicaceae: the At-? genome duplication that is the most recent polyploidy in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and a more recent hexaploidy shared by the genus Brassica and its relatives. By comparing the strength and direction of the natural selection acting at the population and at the species level, we find evidence for continued intensified purifying selection acting on retained duplicates from both polyploidies even down to the present. The constraint observed in preferentially retained genes is not a result of the polyploidy event: the orthologs of such genes experience even stronger constraint in nonpolyploid outgroup genomes. In both the Arabidopsis and Brassica lineages, we further find evidence for segregating mildly deleterious variants, confirming that the population-level data uncover patterns not visible with between-species comparisons. Using the A. thaliana metabolic network, we also explored whether network position was correlated with the measured selective constraint. At both the population and species level, nodes/genes tended to show similar constraints to their neighbors. Our results paint a picture of the long-lived effects of polyploidy on plant genomes, suggesting that even yesterday's polyploids still have distinct evolutionary trajectories."
"Biases in mutation rate can influence molecular evolution, yielding rates of evolution that vary widely in different parts of the genome and even among neighboring nucleotides. Here, we explore one possible mechanism of influence on sequence-specific mutation rates, the electron-hole, which can localize and potentially trigger a replication mismatch. A hole is a mobile site of positive charge created during one-electron oxidation by, for example, radiation, contact with a mutagenic agent, or oxidative stress. Its quantum wavelike properties cause it to localize at various sites with probabilities that vary widely, by orders of magnitude, and depend strongly on the local sequence. We find significant correlations between hole probabilities and mutation rates within base triplets, observed in published mutation accumulation experiments on four species of bacteria. We have also computed hole probability spectra for hypervariable segment I of the human mtDNA control region, which contains several mutational hotspots, and for heptanucleotides in noncoding regions of the human genome, whose polymorphism levels have recently been reported. We observe significant correlations between hole probabilities, and context-specific mutation and substitution rates. The correlation with hole probability cannot be explained entirely by CpG methylation in the heptanucleotide data. Peaks in hole probability tend to coincide with mutational hotspots, even in mtDNA where CpG methylation is rare. Our results suggest that hole-enhanced mutational mechanisms, such as oxidation-stabilized tautomerization and base deamination, contribute to molecular evolution."
"Dinoflagellates are a group of unicellular protists with immense ecological and evolutionary significance and cell biological diversity. Of the photosynthetic dinoflagellates, the majority possess a plastid containing the pigment peridinin, whereas some lineages have replaced this plastid by serial endosymbiosis with plastids of distinct evolutionary affiliations, including a fucoxanthin pigment-containing plastid of haptophyte origin. Previous studies have described the presence of widespread substitutional RNA editing in peridinin and fucoxanthin plastid genes. Because reports of this process have been limited to manual assessment of individual lineages, global trends concerning this RNA editing and its effect on the biological function of the plastid are largely unknown. Using novel bioinformatic methods, we examine the dynamics and evolution of RNA editing over a large multispecies data set of dinoflagellates, including novel sequence data from the peridinin dinoflagellate Pyrocystis lunula and the fucoxanthin dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi. We demonstrate that while most individual RNA editing events in dinoflagellate plastids are restricted to single species, global patterns, and functional consequences of editing are broadly conserved. We find that editing is biased toward specific codon positions and regions of genes, and generally corrects otherwise deleterious changes in the genome prior to translation, though this effect is more prevalent in peridinin than fucoxanthin lineages. Our results support a model for promiscuous editing application subsequently shaped by purifying selection, and suggest the presence of an underlying editing mechanism transferred from the peridinin-containing ancestor into fucoxanthin plastids postendosymbiosis, with remarkably conserved functional consequences in the new lineage."
"The ability of _nding complex associations in large omics datasets, assessing their signi_cance, and prioritizing them according to their strength can be of great help in the data exploration phase. Mutual Information based measures of association are particularly promising, in particular after the recent introduction of the TICe and MICe estimators, which combine computational e_ciency with superior bias/variance properties. An open-source software implementation of these two measures providing a comprehensive procedure to test their signi_cance would be extremely useful.In this paper we present MICtools, a comprehensive and e_ective pipeline which combines TICe and MICe into a multi-step procedure that allows the identi_cation of relationships of various degrees of complexity. MICtools calculates their strength assessing statistical signi_cance using a permutation-based strategy. The performances of the proposed approach are assessed by an extensive investigation in synthetic datasets and an example of a potential application on a metagenomic dataset is also illustrated.We show that MICtools, combining TICe and MICe, is able to highlight associations that would not be captured by conventional strategies. MICtools is implemented in Python, and is available for download at https://github.com/minepy/mictools."
"Advancements in portable scientific instruments provide promising avenues to expedite field work in order to understand the diverse array of organisms that inhabit our planet. Here, we tested the feasibility for in situ molecular analyses of endemic fauna using a portable laboratory fitting within a single backpack, in one of the world's most imperiled biodiversity hotspots: the Ecuadorian Chocó rainforest. We utilized portable equipment, including the MinION nanopore sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and the miniPCR (miniPCR), to perform DNA extraction, PCR amplification and real-time DNA barcoding of reptile specimens in the field.We demonstrate that nanopore sequencing can be implemented in a remote tropical forest to quickly and accurately identify species using DNA barcoding, as we generated consensus sequences for species resolution with an accuracy of >99% in less than 24 hours after collecting specimens. The flexibility of our mobile laboratory further allowed us to generate sequence information at Universidad Tecnológica Indoamérica in Quito for rare, endangered, and undescribed species. This includes the recently re-discovered Jambato toad, which was thought to be extinct for 28 years. Sequences generated on the MinION required as little as 30 reads to achieve high accuracy relative to Sanger sequencing and with further multiplexing of samples, nanopore sequencing can become a cost-effective approach for rapid and portable DNA barcoding.Overall, we establish how mobile laboratories and nanopore sequencing can help to accelerate species identification in remote areas to aid in conservation efforts and be applied to research facilities in developing countries. This opens up possibilities for biodiversity research by promoting local research capacity building, teaching laymen and students about the environment, tackling wildlife crime or by promoting conservation via research focused eco-tourism."
"A complexity of pathway expression in yeast compared to prokaryotes is the need for separate promoters and terminators for each gene expressed. Single transcript expression and separated protein production is possible via the use of 2A viral peptides, but detailed characterization to assess their suitability and applications is needed. The present work aimed to characterize multiple 2A peptide sequences to determine suitability for metabolic engineering applications in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We screened 22 peptides placed between fluorescent protein sequences. Cleaving efficiency was calculated by Western blot intensity of bands corresponding to the cleaved and uncleaved forms of the reporter. Three out of the 22 sequences showed high cleavage efficiency: 2A peptide from Equine rhinitis B virus (91%), Porcine teschovirus-1 (85%) and Operophtera brumata cypovirus-18 (83%). Furthermore, expression of the released protein was comparable to its monocistronic expression. As a proof-of-concept, the triterpene friedelin was successfully produced in the same yeast strain by expressing its synthase with the truncated form of HMG1 linked by the 2A peptide of ERBV-1, with production titers comparable to monocistronic expression (via separate promoters). These results suggest that these peptides could be suitable for expression and translation of multiple proteins in metabolic engineering applications in S. cerevisiae."
"Genome assembly and annotation remains an exacting task. As the tools available for these tasks improve, it is useful to return to data produced with earlier instances to assess their credibility and correctness. The entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora is widely used to control insect pests in horticulture. The genome sequence for this species was reported to encode an unusually high proportion of unique proteins and a paucity of secreted proteins compared to other related nematodes.We revisited the H. bacteriophora genome assembly and gene predictions to ask whether these unusual characteristics were biological or methodological in origin. We mapped an independent resequencing dataset to the genome and used the blobtools pipeline to identify potential contaminants. While present (0.2% of the genome span, 0.4% of predicted proteins), assembly contamination was not significant.Re-prediction of the gene set using BRAKER1 and published transcriptome data generated a predicted proteome that was very different from the published one. The new gene set had a much reduced complement of unique proteins, better completeness values that were in line with other related species' genomes, and an increased number of proteins predicted to be secreted. It is thus likely that methodological issues drove the apparent uniqueness of the initial H. bacteriophora genome annotation and that similar contamination and misannotation issues affect other published genome assemblies."
"The Peruvian scallop, Argopecten purpuratus, is mainly cultured in southern Chile and was introduced into China in the last century. Unlike other Argopecten scallops, the Peruvian scallop normally has a long life span of up to seven to ten years. Therefore, researchers have been employing it to develop hybrid vigor. Here, we performed whole genome sequencing, assembly, and gene annotation of the Peruvian scallop, with an important aim to develop genomic resources for genetic breeding in scallops.A total of 463.19-Gb (Gigabase) raw DNA reads were sequenced. A draft genome assembly of 724.78 Mb was generated (accounting for 81.87% of the estimated genome size of 885.29 Mb), with a contig N50 size of 80.11 kb and a scaffold N50 size of 1.02 Mb. Repeat sequences were calculated to reach 33.74% of the whole genome, and a total of 26,256 protein-coding genes and 3,057 non-coding RNAs were predicted from the assembly.We generated a high quality draft genome assembly of the Peruvian scallop, which will provide a solid resource for further genetic breeding and for the analysis of the evolutionary history of this economically important scallop."
"Nearly 100 years have passed since Frederick Banting and Charles Best first discovered and purified insulin. Their discovery and subsequent improvements revolutionized the treatment of diabetes, and the field continues to move at an ever-faster pace with respect to novel treatments for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Despite these advances, we still do not fully understand how apoptosis of the insulin producing ?-cells is triggered, presenting a challenge in the development of preventative measures. In recent years, the process of autophagy has generated significant interest in this realm due to discoveries highlighting its clear role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. As a result, the number of studies focused on islet and ?-cell autophagy has increased substantially in recent years. In this review, we will discuss what is currently known regarding the role of ?-cell autophagy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes pathogenesis, with an emphasis on new and exciting developments over the past 5 years. Further, we will discuss how these discoveries might be translated into novel treatments in the coming years."
"Stop codons are frequently selected for beyond their regular termination function for error control. The 'ambush hypothesis' proposes out of frame stop codons (OSCs) terminating frameshifted translations are selected for. Although early indirect evidence was partially supportive, recent evidence suggests OSC frequencies are not exceptional when considering underlying nucleotide content. However, prior null tests fail to control amino acid/codon usages or possible local mutational biases. We therefore return to the issue using bacterial genomes, considering several tests defining and testing against a null. We employ simulation approaches preserving amino acid order but shuffling synonymous codons, or preserve codons whilst shuffling amino acid order. Additionally, we compare codon usage in amino acid pairs where one codon can but the next, otherwise identical codon, cannot encode an OSC. OSC frequencies exceed expectations typically in AT-rich genomes, the +1 frame and for TGA/TAA but not TAG. With this complex evidence, simply rejecting or accepting the ambush hypothesis is not warranted. We propose a refined post hoc model whereby AT-rich genomes have more accidental frameshifts, handled by RF2/RF3 complexes (associated with TGA/TAA) and are mostly +1 (or -2) slips. Supporting this, excesses positively correlate with in silico predicted frameshift probabilities. Thus, we propose a more viable framework whereby genomes broadly adopt one of two strategies to combat frameshifts: preventing frameshifting (GC-rich) or permitting frameshifts but minimising impacts when most are caught early (AT-rich). Our refined framework holds promise yet some features, such as the bias of out of frame sense codons, remain unexplained."
"Specialized herbivorous insects have the ability to transition between host plant taxa, and considering the co-evolutionary history between plants and the organisms utilizing them is important to understanding plant insect interactions. We investigated the role of a pine tree parasite, dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.) M. Bieb. Santalales: Viscaceae, in mediating interactions between Neophasia (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) butterflies and pine trees, the butterflies' larval hosts. Mistletoe is considered the butterflies' ancestral host, and the evolutionary transition to pine may have occurred recently. In Arizona, United States, we studied six sites in pine forest habitats: three in Neophasia menapia (Felder and R. Felder, 1859) habitat and three in Neophasia terlooii Behr, 1869 habitat. Each site contained six stands of trees that varied in mistletoe infection severity. Butterfly behavior was observed and ranked at each stand. Volatile compounds were collected from trees at each site and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Female butterflies landed on or patrolled around pine trees (i.e., interacted) more than males, and N. terlooii interacted more with pine trees than N. menapia. Both butterfly species interacted more with tree stands harboring greater mistletoe infection, and N. terlooii interacted more with heavily infected tree stands than did N. menapia. The influence of mistletoe on Neophasia behavior may be mediated by differences in tree volatiles resulting from mistletoe infection. Volatile profiles significantly differed between infected and uninfected pine trees. The role of mistletoe in mediating butterfly interactions with pines has implications for conservation biology and forest management, and highlights the importance of understanding an organism's niche in an evolutionary context."
"Departure of swarms from honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) nests is an important reproductive event for wild honey bee colonies and economically costly in managed bee colonies. The seasonal timing of swarm departure varies regionally and annually, creating challenges for honey bee management and emphasizing the potential for swarming behavior to be affected by plant-pollinator phenological mismatch. In this study, we first document variability in the timing of swarm departure across the large and heterogeneous geographical area of New Jersey over 4 years using 689 swarm-cluster observations. Second, hypothesizing that honey bee colonies adaptively tune the timing of swarm departure to match floral food-resource availability, we predicted that growing degree-days could be used to account for regional and annual variability. To test this idea, we used local weather records to determine the growing degree-day on which each swarm cluster was observed and tested for differences among climate regions and years. The state-wide mean swarm cluster date was May 15 (± 0.6 d), with moderate but significant differences among the state's five climate regions and between years. Use of degree-day information suggests that local heat accumulation can account for some climate-region differences in swarm-departure timing. Annual variation existed on a scale of only several days and was not accounted for by growing degree-days, suggesting little adaptive tuning of swarm-departure timing with respect to local heat accumulation."
"Although trichuriasis affects millions of children worldwide, recommended drugs lack efficacy and new treatment options are urgently needed. Ivermectin has promising potential to complement the anthelminthic armamentarium.A randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted in rural Côte d'Ivoire to provide evidence on the efficacy and safety of ascending oral ivermectin dosages in preschool-aged children and in schoolchildren infected with Trichuris trichiura. Primary outcome was cure rate on T. trichiura infection and secondary outcomes were safety, egg-reduction rates against T. trichiura infection, and cure and egg-reduction rates against other soil-transmitted helminth species.126 preschool-aged and 166 school-aged children were included in an available case analysis. In preschool-aged children efficacy against T. trichiura did not differ between 200 µg/kg ivermectin and placebo as expressed in cure rates (20.9% [95% CI 11.9-52.8%] vs. 19.5% [95% CI 10.4-49.9%]) and geometric mean egg-reduction rates (78.6% [95% CI 60.1-89.5%] vs. 68.2% [95% CI 40.5 to 84.8%]). In school-aged children even a dose of 600 µg/kg ivermectin revealed a low cure rate (12.2% [95% CI 4.8-32.3%] and moderate egg-reduction rate (66.3% [95% CI 43.8-80.2%]. Only mild adverse events and no organ toxicity based on serum biomarkers was observed.Ivermectin can be administered safely to preschool-aged children suffering from trichuriasis. Given the low efficacy of ivermectin monotherapy against T. trichiura infection further research should investigate the optimal drug combinations and dosages with ivermectin against soil-transmitted helminthiasis.The trial is registered at www.isrctn.com, number ISRCTN15871729."
"Notwithstanding the rapid developments in sequencing techniques, Y and W sex chromosomes have still been mostly excluded from whole genome sequencing projects due to their high repetitive DNA content. Therefore, Y and W chromosomes are poorly described in most species despite their biological importance. Several methods were developed for identifying Y or W-linked sequences among unmapped scaffolds. However, it is not enough to discover functional regions from short unmapped scaffolds. Here, we provide a new and simple strategy based on k-mer comparison for comprehensive analysis of the W chromosome in Bombyx mori. Using this novel method, we effectively assembled de novo 1281?W-derived genome contigs (totaling 1.9?Mbp), and identified 156?W-linked transcript RNAs and 345?W-linked small RNAs. This method will help in the elucidation of mechanisms of sexual development and exploration of W chromosome biological functions, and provide insights into the evolution of sex chromosomes. Moreover, we showed this method can be employed in identifying heterogametic sex chromosomes (W and Y chromosomes) in many other species where genomic information is still scarce."
"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are one of the main causes of death and a major financial burden on the world's economy. Due to the limitations of the animal model, computational prediction of serious, rare ADRs is invaluable. However, current state-of-the-art computational methods do not yield significantly better predictions of rare ADRs than random guessing.We present a novel method, based on the theory of ""compressed sensing"", which can accurately predict serious side-effects of candidate and market drugs. Not only is our method able to infer new chemical-ADR associations using existing noisy, biased, and incomplete databases, but our data also demonstrates that the accuracy of compressed sensing in predicting a serious adverse reaction (ADR) for a candidate drug increases with increasing knowledge of other ADRs associated with the drug. In practice, this means that as the candidate drug moves up the different stages of clinical trials, the prediction accuracy of our method will increase accordingly.The program is available at https://github.com/poleksic/side-effects.poleksic@cs.uni.edu or lei.xie@hunter.cuny.edu.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
"PCSK9 has been shown to influence macrophage biology and modulate atherogenesis. We conducted this study to examine the regulation of scavenger receptors (SRs) (LOX-1, SRA and CD36) and oxidized liporoptein cholesterol (ox-LDL) uptake in macrophages by PCSK9.Treatment of mouse peritoneal macrophages with TNF-? resulted in concentration-dependent modest, but significant, increase in PCSK9 expression. Importantly, treatment of TNF-? primed macrophages with recombinant murine PCSK9 increased the expression of LOX-1, SRA and CD36 2-5 fold, and enhanced ox-LDL uptake by ?5-fold. The increase in LOX-1 was much greater than in SRA or CD36. PCSK9 inhibition (by siRNA transfection or use of macrophages from PCSK9-/- mice) reduced the expression of SRs (LOX-1 ? SRA or CD36). Ox-LDL uptake in response to PCSK9 was also inhibited in macrophages from LOX-1-/- mice (P?<?0.05 vs. macrophages from SRA-/- and CD36-/- mice). Upregulation of PCSK9 by cDNA transfection induced intense ox-LDL uptake which was inhibited by co-transfection of cells with siRNA LOX-1 (P?<?0.05 vs. siRNA SRA or siRNA CD36). Further, TNF-?-mediated PCSK9 upregulation and subsequent expression of SRs and ox-LDL uptake were reduced in macrophages from gp91phox-/-, p47phox-/- and p22phox-/- mice (vs. macrophages from wild-type mice).This study shows that in an inflammatory milieu, elevated levels of PCSK9 potently stimulate the expression of SRs (principally LOX-1) and ox-LDL uptake in macrophages, and thus contribute to the process of atherogenesis."
"In this review, we summarise current knowledge on the genetics of coronary artery disease, based on 10 years of genome-wide association studies. The discoveries began with individual studies using 200K single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and progressed to large-scale collaborative efforts, involving more than a hundred thousand people and up to 40 Mio genetic variants. We discuss the challenges ahead, including those involved in identifying causal genes and deciphering the links between risk variants and disease pathology. We also describe novel insights into disease biology based on the findings of genome-wide association studies. Moreover, we discuss the potential for discovery of novel treatment targets through integration of different layers of 'omics' data and application of systems genetics approaches. Finally, we provide a brief outlook on the potential for precision medicine to be enhanced by genome-wide association study findings in the cardiovascular field. (141 words)."
"Recent studies highlight the role of autophagy in cancer tumorigenesis, recurrence, metastasis, and chemoresistance. p62 is an adapter protein that is crucial for the autophagy pathway. In this study, we will describe the expression of p62 and its correlation with clinic prognosis in osteosarcoma.Western blot was used to test the expression of p62 in osteosarcoma cell lines (U2OS, KHOS, MG63, Saos-2, U2OSR2, KHOSR2, and 143B). A tissue microarray (TMA) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry to determine the expression levels of p62 in osteosarcoma patients and evaluate any correlation between p62 and clinical characteristics in osteosarcoma patients.p62 was expressed differently in all cell lines. The TMA also showed differential expression in osteosarcoma tissues. Seventy-five of 79 (94.9%) patient tissues exhibited p62 immunostaining, ranging from no staining (4 of 97, 5.1%) to 1+ staining (40 of 79, 50.6%), 2+ staining (17 of 79, 21.5%), and 3+ staining (18 of 79, 22.8%). The low staining (1+) was classified as the p62 weak group (50.6%), the medium staining (2+) and intense staining (3+) were classified as the p62 strong group (44.3%). Analyzing the clinical data of the osteosarcoma TMA, we found that the 5-year survival rate of patients with weak p62 expression was significantly lower than that of the patients with strong p62 expression (p = 0.0165). Furthermore, the decreased p62 expression may be associated with higher metastatic and chemoresistant rates in osteosarcoma patients.Our results suggest that p62 may be an effective predictor of prognosis and a potential target for therapy in osteosarcoma."
"Proteus mirabilis is one of the most common causes of urinary tract infection (UTI), particularly in patients undergoing long-term catheterization. Phage vB_PmiS-TH was isolated from wastewater with high lytic activity against P. mirabilis (TH) isolated from UTI. The phage had rapid adsorption, a large burst size (?260 PFU per infected cell), and high stability at a wide range of temperatures and pH values. As analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, phage vB_PmiS-TH had an icosahedral head of ?87 × 62 nm with a noncontractile tail about 137 nm in length and 11 nm in width. It belongs to the family Siphoviridae. Combination of the phage vB_PmiS-TH with ampicillin had a higher removal activity against planktonic cells of P. mirabilis (TH) than the phage or the antibiotic alone. Combination of the phage at a multiplicity of infection of 100 with a high dose of ampicillin (246 µg/mL) showed the highest biofilm removal activity after 24 h. This study demonstrates that using a combination of phage and antibiotic could be significantly more effective against planktonic and biofilm forms of P. mirabilis (TH)."
"Immunoglobulin A (IgA) plays an important role in protecting our mucosal surfaces from viral infection, in maintaining a balance with the commensal bacterial flora, and in extending maternal immunity via breast feeding. Here, we report an additional innate immune effector function of human IgA molecules in that we demonstrate that the C-terminal tail unique to IgA molecules interferes with cell-surface attachment of influenza A and other enveloped viruses that use sialic acid as a receptor. This antiviral activity is mediated by sialic acid found in the complex N-linked glycans at position 459. Antiviral activity was observed even in the absence of classical antibody binding via the antigen binding sites. Our data, therefore, show that the C-terminal tail of IgA subtypes provides an innate line of defense against viruses that use sialic acid as a receptor and the role of neuraminidases present on these virions."
"A hallmark of advanced prostate cancer (PC) is the concomitant loss of PTEN and p53 function. To selectively eliminate such cells, we screened cytotoxic compounds on Pten-/-;Trp53-/-fibroblasts and their Pten-WT reference. Highly selective killing of Pten-null cells can be achieved by deguelin, a natural insecticide. Deguelin eliminates Pten-deficient cells through inhibition of mitochondrial complex I (CI). Five hundred-fold higher drug doses are needed to obtain the same killing of Pten-WT cells, even though deguelin blocks their electron transport chain equally well. Selectivity arises because mitochondria of Pten-null cells consume ATP through complex V, instead of producing it. The resulting glucose dependency can be exploited to selectively kill Pten-null cells with clinically relevant CI inhibitors, especially if they are lipophilic. In vivo, deguelin suppressed disease in our genetically engineered mouse model for metastatic PC. Our data thus introduce a vulnerability for highly selective targeting of incurable PC with inhibitors of CI."
"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are commonly dysregulated in tumors, but only a handful are known to play pathophysiological roles in cancer. We inferred lncRNAs that dysregulate cancer pathways, oncogenes, and tumor suppressors (cancer genes) by modeling their effects on the activity of transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and microRNAs in 5,185 TCGA tumors and 1,019 ENCODE assays. Our predictions included hundreds of candidate onco- and tumor-suppressor lncRNAs (cancer lncRNAs) whose somatic alterations account for the dysregulation of dozens of cancer genes and pathways in each of 14 tumor contexts. To demonstrate proof of concept, we showed that perturbations targeting OIP5-AS1 (an inferred tumor suppressor) and TUG1 and WT1-AS (inferred onco-lncRNAs) dysregulated cancer genes and altered proliferation of breast and gynecologic cancer cells. Our analysis indicates that, although most lncRNAs are dysregulated in a tumor-specific manner, some, including OIP5-AS1, TUG1, NEAT1, MEG3, and TSIX, synergistically dysregulate cancer pathways in multiple tumor contexts."
"For the past decade, cancer genomic studies have focused on mutations leading to splice-site disruption, overlooking those having splice-creating potential. Here, we applied a bioinformatic tool, MiSplice, for the large-scale discovery of splice-site-creating mutations (SCMs) across 8,656 TCGA tumors. We report 1,964 originally mis-annotated mutations having clear evidence of creating alternative splice junctions. TP53 and GATA3 have 26 and 18 SCMs, respectively, and ATRX has 5 from lower-grade gliomas. Mutations in 11 genes, including PARP1, BRCA1, and BAP1, were experimentally validated for splice-site-creating function. Notably, we found that neoantigens induced by SCMs are likely several folds more immunogenic compared to missense mutations, exemplified by the recurrent GATA3 SCM. Further, high expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was observed in tumors with SCMs, suggesting candidates for immune blockade therapy. Our work highlights the importance of integrating DNA and RNA data for understanding the functional and the clinical implications of mutations in human diseases."
"Metabolic reprogramming provides critical information for clinical oncology. Using molecular data of 9,125 patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified tumor subtypes in 33 cancer types based on mRNA expression patterns of seven major metabolic processes and assessed their clinical relevance. Our metabolic expression subtypes correlated extensively with clinical outcome: subtypes with upregulated carbohydrate, nucleotide, and vitamin/cofactor metabolism most consistently correlated with worse prognosis, whereas subtypes with upregulated lipid metabolism showed the opposite. Metabolic subtypes correlated with diverse somatic drivers but exhibited effects convergent on cancer hallmark pathways and were modulated by highly recurrent master regulators across cancer types. As a proof-of-concept example, we demonstrated that knockdown of SNAI1 or RUNX1-master regulators of carbohydrate metabolic subtypes-modulates metabolic activity and drug sensitivity. Our study provides a system-level view of metabolic heterogeneity within and across cancer types and identifies pathway cross-talk, suggesting related prognostic, therapeutic, and predictive utility."
"DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways modulate cancer risk, progression, and therapeutic response. We systematically analyzed somatic alterations to provide a comprehensive view of DDR deficiency across 33 cancer types. Mutations with accompanying loss of heterozygosity were observed in over 1/3 of DDR genes, including TP53 and BRCA1/2. Other prevalent alterations included epigenetic silencing of the direct repair genes EXO5, MGMT, and ALKBH3 in ?20% of samples. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) was present at varying frequency in many cancer types, most notably ovarian cancer. However, in contrast to ovarian cancer, HRD was associated with worse outcomes in several other cancers. Protein structure-based analyses allowed us to predict functional consequences of rare, recurrent DDR mutations. A new machine-learning-based classifier developed from gene expression data allowed us to identify alterations that phenocopy deleterious TP53 mutations. These frequent DDR gene alterations in many human cancers have functional consequences that may determine cancer progression and guide therapy."
"Gene fusions represent an important class of somatic alterations in cancer. We systematically investigated fusions in 9,624 tumors across 33 cancer types using multiple fusion calling tools. We identified a total of 25,664 fusions, with a 63% validation rate. Integration of gene expression, copy number, and fusion annotation data revealed that fusions involving oncogenes tend to exhibit increased expression, whereas fusions involving tumor suppressors have the opposite effect. For fusions involving kinases, we found 1,275 with an intact kinase domain, the proportion of which varied significantly across cancer types. Our study suggests that fusions drive the development of 16.5% of cancer cases and function as the sole driver in more than 1% of them. Finally, we identified druggable fusions involving genes such as TMPRSS2, RET, FGFR3, ALK, and ESR1 in 6.0% of cases, and we predicted immunogenic peptides, suggesting that fusions may provide leads for targeted drug and immune therapy."
"Protein ubiquitination is a dynamic and reversible process of adding single ubiquitin molecules or various ubiquitin chains to target proteins. Here, using multidimensional omic data of 9,125 tumor samples across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we perform comprehensive molecular characterization of 929 ubiquitin-related genes and 95 deubiquitinase genes. Among them, we systematically identify top somatic driver candidates, including mutated FBXW7 with cancer-type-specific patterns and amplified MDM2 showing a mutually exclusive pattern with BRAF mutations. Ubiquitin pathway genes tend to be upregulated in cancer mediated by diverse mechanisms. By integrating pan-cancer multiomic data, we identify a group of tumor samples that exhibit worse prognosis. These samples are consistently associated with the upregulation of cell-cycle and DNA repair pathways, characterized by mutated TP53, MYC/TERT amplification, and APC/PTEN deletion. Our analysis highlights the importance of the ubiquitin pathway in cancer development and lays a foundation for developing relevant therapeutic strategies."
"This integrated, multiplatform PanCancer Atlas study co-mapped and identified distinguishing molecular features of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) from five sites associated with smoking and/or human papillomavirus (HPV). SCCs harbor 3q, 5p, and other recurrent chromosomal copy-number alterations (CNAs), DNA mutations, and/or aberrant methylation of genes and microRNAs, which are correlated with the expression of multi-gene programs linked to squamous cell stemness, epithelial-to-mesenchymal differentiation, growth, genomic integrity, oxidative damage, death, and inflammation. Low-CNA SCCs tended to be HPV(+) and display hypermethylation with repression of TET1 demethylase and FANCF, previously linked to predisposition to SCC, or harbor mutations affecting CASP8, RAS-MAPK pathways, chromatin modifiers, and immunoregulatory molecules. We uncovered hypomethylation of the alternative promoter that drives expression of the ?Np63 oncogene and embedded miR944. Co-expression of immune checkpoint, T-regulatory, and Myeloid suppressor cells signatures may explain reduced efficacy of immune therapy. These findings support possibilities for molecular classification and therapeutic approaches."
"Beyond sample curation and basic pathologic characterization, the digitized H&E-stained images of TCGA samples remain underutilized. To highlight this resource, we present mappings of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) based on H&E images from 13 TCGA tumor types. These TIL maps are derived through computational staining using a convolutional neural network trained to classify patches of images. Affinity propagation revealed local spatial structure in TIL patterns and correlation with overall survival. TIL map structural patterns were grouped using standard histopathological parameters. These patterns are enriched in particular T cell subpopulations derived from molecular measures. TIL densities and spatial structure were differentially enriched among tumor types, immune subtypes, and tumor molecular subtypes, implying that spatial infiltrate state could reflect particular tumor cell aberration states. Obtaining spatial lymphocytic patterns linked to the rich genomic characterization of TCGA samples demonstrates one use for the TCGA image archives with insights into the tumor-immune microenvironment."
"Precision oncology uses genomic evidence to match patients with treatment but often fails to identify all patients who may respond. The transcriptome of these ""hidden responders"" may reveal responsive molecular states. We describe and evaluate a machine-learning approach to classify aberrant pathway activity in tumors, which may aid in hidden responder identification. The algorithm integrates RNA-seq, copy number, and mutations from 33 different cancer types across The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PanCanAtlas project to predict aberrant molecular states in tumors. Applied to the Ras pathway, the method detects Ras activation across cancer types and identifies phenocopying variants. The model, trained on human tumors, can predict response to MEK inhibitors in wild-type Ras cell lines. We also present data that suggest that multiple hits in the Ras pathway confer increased Ras activity. The transcriptome is underused in precision oncology and, combined with machine learning, can aid in the identification of hidden responders."
"Environmental stress can induce adult reproductive diapause, a state of developmental arrest that temporarily suspends reproduction. Deficiency for C. elegans Piwi protein PRG-1 results in strains that reproduce for many generations but then become sterile. We found that sterile-generation prg-1/Piwi mutants typically displayed pronounced germ cell atrophy as L4 larvae matured into 1-day-old adults. Atrophied germlines spontaneously reproliferated across the first days of adulthood, and this was accompanied by fertility for day 2-4 adults. Sterile day 5 prg-1 mutant adults remained sterile indefinitely, but providing an alternative food source could restore their fertility. Our data imply that late-generation prg-1 mutants experience a dynamic form of adult reproductive diapause, promoted by stress response, cell death, and RNAi pathways, where delayed fertility and reproductive quiescence represent parallel adaptive developmental outcomes. This may occur in response to a form of ""heritable stress"" that is transmitted by gametes and epigenetic in nature."
"The U2AF35-like ZRSR1 has been implicated in the recognition of 3' splice site during spliceosome assembly, but ZRSR1 knockout mice do not show abnormal phenotypes. To analyze ZRSR1 function and its precise role in RNA splicing, we generated ZRSR1 mutant mice containing truncating mutations within its RNA-recognition motif. Homozygous mutant mice exhibited severe defects in erythrocytes, muscle stretch, and spermatogenesis, along with germ cell sloughing and apoptosis, ultimately leading to azoospermia and male sterility. Testis RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses revealed increased intron retention of both U2- and U12-type introns, including U12-type intron events in genes with key functions in spermatogenesis and spermatid development. Affected U2 introns were commonly found flanking U12 introns, suggesting functional cross-talk between the two spliceosomes. The splicing and tissue defects observed in mutant mice attributed to ZRSR1 loss of function suggest a physiological role for this factor in U12 intron splicing."
"The regulation of mitochondrial RNA life cycles and their roles in ribosome biogenesis and energy metabolism are not fully understood. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate heart- and skeletal-muscle-specific knockout mice of the pentatricopeptide repeat domain protein 1, PTCD1, and show that its loss leads to severe cardiomyopathy and premature death. Our detailed transcriptome-wide and functional analyses of these mice enabled us to identify the molecular role of PTCD1 as a 16S rRNA-binding protein essential for its stability, pseudouridylation, and correct biogenesis of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit. We show that impaired mitoribosome biogenesis can have retrograde signaling effects on nuclear gene expression through the transcriptional activation of the mTOR pathway and upregulation of cytoplasmic protein synthesis and pro-survival factors in the absence of mitochondrial translation. Taken together, our data show that impaired assembly of the mitoribosome exerts its consequences via differential regulation of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic protein synthesis."
"CDK4/6 inhibitors are effective against cancer cells expressing the tumor suppressor RB1, but not RB1-deficient cells, posing the challenge of how to target RB1 loss. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), RB1 and PTEN are frequently inactivated together with TP53. We performed kinome/phosphatase inhibitor screens on primary mouse Rb/p53-, Pten/p53-, and human RB1/PTEN/TP53-deficient TNBC cell lines and identified CDC25 phosphatase as a common target. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of CDC25 suppressed growth of RB1-deficient TNBC cells that are resistant to combined CDK4/6 plus CDK2 inhibition. Minimal cooperation was observed in vitro between CDC25 antagonists and CDK1, CDK2, or CDK4/6 inhibitors, but strong synergy with WEE1 inhibition was apparent. In accordance with increased PI3K signaling following long-term CDC25 inhibition, CDC25 and PI3K inhibitors effectively synergized to suppress TNBC growth both in vitro and in xenotransplantation models. These results provide a rationale for the development of CDC25-based therapies for diverse RB1/PTEN/TP53-deficient and -proficient TNBCs."
"Somatic mutations in DNMT3A are recurrent events across a range of blood cancers. Dnmt3a loss of function in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) skews divisions toward self-renewal at the expense of differentiation. Moreover, DNMT3A mutations can be detected in the blood of aging individuals, indicating that mutant cells outcompete normal HSCs over time. It is important to understand how these mutations provide a competitive advantage to HSCs. Here we show that Dnmt3a-null HSCs can regenerate over at least 12 transplant generations in mice, far exceeding the lifespan of normal HSCs. Molecular characterization reveals that this in vivo immortalization is associated with gradual and focal losses of DNA methylation at key regulatory regions associated with self-renewal genes, producing a highly stereotypical HSC phenotype in which epigenetic features are further buttressed. These findings lend insight into the preponderance of DNMT3A mutations in clonal hematopoiesis and the persistence of mutant clones after chemotherapy."
"In this issue of Structure, Tyzack et al. (2018) present a study of enzyme-ligand complexes in the PDB and show that the molecular similarity of bound and cognate ligands can be used to choose the most biologically appropriate complex structure for analysis when multiple structures are available."
"Animals require an immediate response to oxygen availability to allow rapid shifts between oxidative and glycolytic metabolism. These metabolic shifts are highly regulated by the HIF transcription factor. The factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) is an asparaginyl hydroxylase that controls HIF transcriptional activity in an oxygen-dependent manner. We show here that FIH loss increases oxidative metabolism, while also increasing glycolytic capacity, and that this gives rise to an increase in oxygen consumption. We further show that the loss of FIH acts to accelerate the cellular metabolic response to hypoxia. Skeletal muscle expresses 50-fold higher levels of FIH than other tissues: we analyzed skeletal muscle FIH mutants and found a decreased metabolic efficiency, correlated with an increased oxidative rate and an increased rate of hypoxic response. We find that FIH, through its regulation of oxidation, acts in concert with the PHD/vHL pathway to accelerate HIF-mediated metabolic responses to hypoxia."
"How intracellular pathogens acquire essential non-diffusible host metabolites and whether the host cell counteracts the siphoning of these nutrients by its invaders are open questions. Here we show that host mitochondria fuse during infection by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii to limit its uptake of fatty acids (FAs). A combination of genetics and imaging of FA trafficking indicates that Toxoplasma infection triggers lipophagy, the autophagy of host lipid droplets (LDs), to secure cellular FAs essential for its proliferation. Indeed, Toxoplasma FA siphoning and growth are reduced in host cells genetically deficient for autophagy or triglyceride depots. Conversely, Toxoplasma FA uptake and proliferation are increased in host cells lacking mitochondrial fusion, required for efficient mitochondrial FA oxidation, or where mitochondrial FA oxidation is pharmacologically inhibited. Thus, mitochondrial fusion can be regarded as a cellular defense mechanism against intracellular parasites, by limiting Toxoplasma access to host nutrients liberated by lipophagy."
"Glucocorticoid and other adipogenic hormones are secreted in mammals in circadian oscillations. Loss of this circadian oscillation pattern correlates with obesity in humans, raising the intriguing question of how hormone secretion dynamics affect adipocyte differentiation. Using live, single-cell imaging of the key adipogenic transcription factors CEBPB and PPARG, endogenously tagged with fluorescent proteins, we show that pulsatile circadian hormone stimuli are rejected by the adipocyte differentiation control system. In striking contrast, equally strong persistent signals trigger maximal differentiation. We identify the mechanism of how hormone oscillations are filtered as a combination of slow and fast positive feedback centered on PPARG. Furthermore, we confirm in mice that flattening of daily glucocorticoid oscillations significantly increases the mass of subcutaneous and visceral fat pads. Together, our study provides a molecular mechanism for why stress, Cushing's disease, and other conditions for which glucocorticoid secretion loses its pulsatility may lead to obesity."
"The efficiency of intestinal absorption of dietary fat constitutes a primary determinant accounting for individual vulnerability to obesity. However, how fat absorption is controlled and contributes to obesity remains unclear. Here, we show that inhibition of endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) increases the abundance of triacylglycerol synthesis enzymes and fat absorption in small intestine. The C2-domain protein AIDA acts as an essential factor for the E3-ligase HRD1 of ERAD to downregulate rate-limiting acyltransferases GPAT3, MOGAT2, and DGAT2. Aida-/-mice, when grown in a thermal-neutral condition or fed high-fat diet, display increased intestinal fatty acid re-esterification, circulating and tissue triacylglycerol, accompanied with severely increased adiposity without enhancement of adipogenesis. Intestine-specific knockout of Aida largely phenocopies its whole-body knockout, strongly indicating that increased intestinal TAG synthesis is a primary impetus to obesity. The AIDA-mediated ERAD system may thus represent an anti-thrifty mechanism impinging on the enzymes for intestinal fat absorption and systemic fat storage."
"Once thought to be a waste product of anaerobic metabolism, lactate is now known to form continuously under aerobic conditions. Shuttling between producer and consumer cells fulfills at least three purposes for lactate: (1) a major energy source, (2) the major gluconeogenic precursor, and (3) a signaling molecule. ""Lactate shuttle"" (LS) concepts describe the roles of lactate in delivery of oxidative and gluconeogenic substrates as well as in cell signaling. In medicine, it has long been recognized that the elevation of blood lactate correlates with illness or injury severity. However, with lactate shuttle theory in mind, some clinicians are now appreciating lactatemia as a ""strain"" and not a ""stress"" biomarker. In fact, clinical studies are utilizing lactate to treat pro-inflammatory conditions and to deliver optimal fuel for working muscles in sports medicine. The above, as well as historic and recent studies of lactate metabolism and shuttling, are discussed in the following review."
"How brown and beige adipocytes activate UCP1-dependent thermogenesis has been studied in great detail. In Cell Metabolism, Tharp et al. (2018) have recently added another interesting dimension to this by demonstrating that actinomyosin-mediated elasticity regulates the thermogenic capacity of UCP1+ adipocytes, opening up new ways by which UCP1-dependent thermogenesis can be stimulated."
"Cellular senescence is traditionally viewed as a permanent form of cell cycle arrest that restrains tumorigenesis. In a recent study in Nature, however, Milanovic et al. (2018) challenge this conventional view, showing that senescence can counterintuitively promote cancer stemness and tumor aggressiveness. This finding suggests that attacking senescence can be exploited in cancer therapy."
"Organohalide respiration (OHR), comprising the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated organic compounds, is subject to a unique memory effect and long-term transcriptional downregulation of the involved genes in Sulfurospirillum multivorans. Gene expression ceases slowly over approximately 100 generations in the absence of tetrachloroethene (PCE). However, the molecular mechanisms of this regulation process are not understood. We show here that Sulfurospirillum halorespirans undergoes the same type of regulation when cultivated without chlorinated ethenes for a long period of time. In addition, we compared the proteomes of S. halorespirans cells cultivated in the presence of PCE with those of cells long- and short-term cultivated with nitrate as sole electron acceptor. Important OHR-related proteins previously unidentified in S. multivorans include a histidine kinase, a putative quinol dehydrogenase membrane protein, and a PCE-induced porin. Since for some regulatory proteins a posttranslational regulation of activity by lysine acetylations is known, we also analyzed the acetylome of S. halorespirans, revealing that 32% of the proteome was acetylated in at least one condition. The data indicate that the response regulator and the histidine kinase of a two-component system most probably involved in induction of PCE respiration are highly acetylated during short-term cultivation with nitrate in the absence of PCE.The so far unique long-term downregulation of organohalide respiration is now identified in a second species suggesting a broader distribution of this regulatory phenomenon. An improved protein extraction method allowed the identification of proteins most probably involved in transcriptional regulation of OHR in Sulfurospirillum spp. Our data indicate that acetylations of regulatory proteins are involved in this extreme, sustained standby-mode of metabolic enzymes in the absence of substrate. This first published acetylome of Epsilonproteobacteria might help to study other ecologically or medically important species of this clade."
"Tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF-?) is a proinflammatory cytokine with manifold consequences for mammalian pathophysiology, including cardiovascular disease. A deeper understanding of TNF-? biology may enhance treatment precision.To conduct an epigenome-wide analysis of blood-derived DNA methylation and TNF-? levels and to assess the clinical relevance of findings.This meta-analysis assessed epigenome-wide associations in circulating TNF-? concentrations from 5 cohort studies and 1 interventional trial, with replication in 3 additional cohort studies. Follow-up analyses investigated associations of identified methylation loci with gene expression and incident coronary heart disease; this meta-analysis included 11?461 participants who experienced 1895 coronary events.Circulating TNF-? concentration.DNA methylation at approximately 450?000 loci, neighboring DNA sequence variation, gene expression, and incident coronary heart disease.The discovery cohort included 4794 participants, and the replication study included 816 participants (overall mean [SD] age, 60.7 [8.5] years). In the discovery stage, circulating TNF-? levels were associated with methylation of 7 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, 3 of which were located in or near DTX3L-PARP9 at cg00959259 (? [SE]?=?-0.01 [0.003]; P?=?7.36?×?10-8), cg08122652 (? [SE]?=?-0.008 [0.002]; P?=?2.24?×?10-7), and cg22930808(? [SE]?=?-0.01 [0.002]; P?=?6.92?×?10-8); NLRC5 at cg16411857 (? [SE]?=?-0.01 [0.002]; P?=?2.14?×?10-13) and cg07839457 (? [SE]?=?-0.02 [0.003]; P?=?6.31?×?10-10); or ABO, at cg13683939 (? [SE]?=?0.04 [0.008]; P?=?1.42?×?10-7) and cg24267699 (? [SE]?=?-0.009 [0.002]; P?=?1.67?×?10-7), after accounting for multiple testing. Of these, negative associations between TNF-? concentration and methylation of 2 loci in NLRC5 and 1 in DTX3L-14 PARP9 were replicated. Replicated TNF-?-linked CpG sites were associated with 9% to 19% decreased risk of incident coronary heart disease per 10% higher methylation per CpG site (cg16411857: hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-1.95; P?=?.003; cg07839457: HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80-0.94; P?=?3.1?×?10-5; cg00959259: HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97; P?=?.002; cg08122652: HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.74-0.89; P?=?2.0?×?10-5).We identified and replicated novel epigenetic correlates of circulating TNF-? concentration in blood samples and linked these loci to coronary heart disease risk, opening opportunities for validation and therapeutic applications."
"Species response to climate change is influenced by predictable (selective) and unpredictable (random) evolutionary processes. To understand how climate change will affect present-day species, it is necessary to assess their adaptive potential and distinguish it from the effects of random processes. This will allow predicting how different genotypes will respond to forecasted environmental change. Space for time substitution experiments are an elegant way to test the response of present day populations to climate variation in real time. Here we assess neutral and putatively adaptive variation in 11 populations of Festuca rubra situated along crossed gradients of temperature and moisture using molecular markers and phenotypic measurements, respectively. By comparing population differentiation in putatively neutral molecular markers and phenotypic traits (QST-FST comparisons), we show the existence of adaptive differentiation in phenotypic traits and their plasticity across the climatic gradient. The observed patterns of differentiation are due to the high genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of the populations from the coldest (and wettest) environment. Finally, we observe statistically significant covariation between markers and phenotypic traits, which is likely caused by isolation by adaptation. These results contribute to a better understanding of the current adaptation and evolutionary potential to face climate change of a widespread species. They can also be extrapolated to understand how the studied populations will adjust to upcoming climate change without going through the lengthy process of phenotyping."
"The propensity of a trait to vary within a population may have evolutionary, ecological, or clinical significance. In the present study we deploy sibling models to offer a novel and unbiased way to ascertain loci associated with the extent to which phenotypes vary (variance-controlling quantitative trait loci, or vQTLs). Previous methods for vQTL-mapping either exclude genetically related individuals or treat genetic relatedness among individuals as a complicating factor addressed by adjusting estimates for non-independence in phenotypes. The present method uses genetic relatedness as a tool to obtain unbiased estimates of variance effects rather than as a nuisance. The family-based approach, which utilizes random variation between siblings in minor allele counts at a locus, also allows controls for parental genotype, mean effects, and non-linear (dominance) effects that may spuriously appear to generate variation. Simulations show that the approach performs equally well as two existing methods (squared Z-score and DGLM) in controlling type I error rates when there is no unobserved confounding, and performs significantly better than these methods in the presence of small degrees of confounding. Using height and BMI as empirical applications, we investigate SNPs that alter within-family variation in height and BMI, as well as pathways that appear to be enriched. One significant SNP for BMI variability, in the MAST4 gene, replicated. Pathway analysis revealed one gene set, encoding members of several signaling pathways related to gap junction function, which appears significantly enriched for associations with within-family height variation in both datasets (while not enriched in analysis of mean levels). We recommend approximating laboratory random assignment of genotype using family data and more careful attention to the possible conflation of mean and variance effects."
"Applying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to identify feasible biomarkers in diseases can be a hard task when working with heterogeneous datasets. Expression data are strongly influenced by technology, sample preparation processes, and/or labeling methods. The proliferation of different microarray platforms for measuring gene expression increases the need to develop models able to compare their results, especially when different technologies can lead to signal values that vary greatly. Integrative meta-analysis can significantly improve the reliability and robustness of DEG detection. The objective of this work was to develop an integrative approach for identifying potential cancer biomarkers by integrating gene expression data from two different platforms. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where there is an urgent need to find new biomarkers due its late diagnosis, is an ideal candidate for testing this technology. Expression data from two different datasets, namely Affymetrix and Illumina (18 and 36 PDAC patients, respectively), as well as from 18 healthy controls, was used for this study. A meta-analysis based on an empirical Bayesian methodology (ComBat) was then proposed to integrate these datasets. DEGs were finally identified from the integrated data by using the statistical programming language R. After our integrative meta-analysis, 5 genes were commonly identified within the individual analyses of the independent datasets. Also, 28 novel genes that were not reported by the individual analyses ('gained' genes) were also discovered. Several of these gained genes have been already related to other gastroenterological tumors. The proposed integrative meta-analysis has revealed novel DEGs that may play an important role in PDAC and could be potential biomarkers for diagnosing the disease."
"Recent advances have made it possible to readily derive cardiac myocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). HiPSC-CMs represent a valuable new experimental model for studying human cardiac muscle physiology and disease. Many laboratories have devoted substantial effort to examining the functional properties of isolated hiPSC-CMs, but to date, force production has not been adequately characterized. Here, we utilized traction force microscopy (TFM) with micro-patterning cell printing to investigate the maximum force production of isolated single hiPSC-CMs under varied culture and assay conditions. We examined the role of length of differentiation in culture and the effects of varied extracellular calcium concentration in the culture media on the maturation of hiPSC-CMs. Results show that hiPSC-CMs developing in culture for two weeks produced significantly less force than cells cultured from one to three months, with hiPSC-CMs cultured for three months resembling the cell morphology and function of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in terms of size, dimensions, and force production. Furthermore, hiPSC-CMs cultured long term in conditions of physiologic calcium concentrations were larger and produced more force than hiPSC-CMs cultured in standard media with sub-physiological calcium. We also examined relationships between cell morphology, substrate stiffness and force production. Results showed a significant relationship between cell area and force. Implementing directed modifications of substrate stiffness, by varying stiffness from embryonic-like to adult myocardium-like, hiPSC-CMs produced maximal forces on substrates with a lower modulus and significantly less force when assayed on increasingly stiff adult myocardium-like substrates. Calculated strain energy measurements paralleled these findings. Collectively, these findings further establish single cell TFM as a valuable approach to illuminate the quantitative physiological maturation of force in hiPSC-CMs."
"The emergence of pathogenic multidrug-resistant bacteria demands new approaches in finding effective antibacterial agents. Synthetic flavonoids could be a reliable solution due to their important antimicrobial activity. We report here the potent in vitro antibacterial activity of ClCl-flav-a novel synthetic tricyclic flavonoid. The antimicrobial effects were tested using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), time kill and biofilm formation assays. Fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were employed to study the mechanism of action. MTT test was used to assess the cytotoxicity of ClCl-flav. Our results showed that Gram positive bacteria were more sensitive (MIC = 0.24 ?g/mL) to ClCl-flav compared to the Gram negative ones (MIC = 3.9 ?g/mL). We found that our compound showed significantly enhanced antibacterial activities, 32 to 72-fold more active than other synthetic flavonoids. ClCl-flav showed bactericidal activity at concentrations ranging from 0.48 to 15.62 ?g/mL. At twice the MIC, all Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae cells were killed within 1 h. Also ClCl-flav presented good anti-biofilm activity. The mechanism of action is related to the impairment of the cell membrane integrity. No or very low cytotoxicity was evidenced at effective concentrations against Vero cells. Based on the strong antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity assessment, ClCl-flav has a good potential for the design of new antimicrobial agents."
"Vasculature is an interface between the circulation and the hematopoietic tissue providing the means for hundreds of billions of blood cells to enter the circulation every day in a regulated fashion. The precise mechanisms that control the interactions of hematopoietic cells with the vessel wall are largely undefined. Here, we report on the development of an in vitro 3D human marrow vascular microenvironment (VME) to study hematopoietic trafficking and the release of blood cells, specifically platelets. We show that mature megakaryocytes from aspirated marrow as well as megakaryocytes differentiated in culture from CD34+ cells can be embedded in a collagen matrix containing engineered microvessels to create a thrombopoietic VME. These megakaryocytes continue to mature, penetrate the vessel wall, and release platelets into the vessel lumen. This process can be blocked with the addition of antibodies specific for CXCR4, indicating that CXCR4 is required for megakaryocyte migration, though whether it is sufficient is unclear. The 3D marrow VME system shows considerable potential for mechanistic studies defining the role of marrow vasculature in thrombopoiesis. Through a stepwise addition or removal of individual marrow components, this model provides potential to define key pathways responsible for the release of platelets and other blood cells."
"In many experiments using fetal mice, it is necessary to determine the sex of the individual fetus. However, other than genotyping for sex-specific genes, there is no convenient, reliable method of sexing mice between gestational day (GD) 16.5 and GD 18.0. We designed a rapid, relatively simple visual method to determine the sex of mouse fetuses in the GD 16.5-GD 18.0 range that can be performed as part of a routine morphological assessment. By examining the genitalia for the presence or absence of key features, raters with minimal experience with the method were able to correctly identify the sex of embryos with 99% accuracy, while raters with no experience were 95% accurate. The critical genital features include: the presence or absence of urethral seam or proximal urethral meatus; the shape of the genitalia, and the presence or absence of an area related to the urethral plate. By comparing these morphological features of the external genitalia, we show a simple, accurate, and fast way to determine the sex of late stage mouse fetuses. Integrating this method into regular morphological assessments will facilitate the determination of sex differences in fetuses between GD 16.5 and GD 18.0."
"Sustained management efforts by private landowners are crucial for the long-term success of private land natural resource conservation and related environmental benefits. Landowner outreach is a primary means of recruiting private landowners into voluntary conservation incentive programs, and could also help sustain conservation behaviors through time. However, evaluation of outreach targeting landowners during or after participation in natural resource conservation incentive programs is lacking. We assessed two methods of landowner outreach associated with a Natural Resources Conservation Service incentive program targeting effective management of early successional forest habitat on private land in the Appalachians and Upper Great Lakes regions of the United States. While early successional forest habitat benefits many wildlife species, the program target species were the Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) and American Woodcock (Scolopax minor). After habitat management through the program occurred, biological technicians monitored wildlife and vegetation on enrolled properties and results were communicated to landowners in mailed packets. Our research focused on whether landowner interactions with technicians or receipt of result mailings could influence landowner post-program management intentions and management-related cognitions (e.g., agency trust, perceptions of outcomes). We conducted a telephone survey with landowners from January to May 2017, and analyzed survey data using quantitative group comparisons and qualitative coding methods. Landowners that accompanied biological technicians on monitoring site visits had higher agency trust and more positive perceptions of program outcomes. Result mailings did not improve landowner perceptions of program outcomes or agency trust, but did provide benefits such as increased landowner knowledge about birds. Neither outreach method was associated with more positive landowner post-program management intentions. Our findings underline the importance and potential of direct interactions between conservation biologists and landowners. These two forms of non-traditional outreach administered by biologists could be a worthwhile component of future conservation program evaluations on private lands."
"Wood represents the most abundant biomass produced by plants and one of its major components is acetyl xylan. Acetylation in xylan can occur at O-2 or O-3 of a xylosyl residue, at both O-2 and O-3 of a xylosyl residue, and at O-3 of a xylosyl residue substituted at O-2 with glucuronic acid. Acetyltransferases responsible for the regiospecific acetylation of xylan in tree species have not yet been characterized. Here we report the biochemical characterization of twelve Populus trichocarpa DUF231-containing proteins, named PtrXOATs, for their roles in the regiospecific acetylation of xylan. The PtrXOAT genes were found to be differentially expressed in Populus organs and among them, PtrXOAT1, PtrXOAT2, PtrXOAT9 and PtrXOAT10 exhibited the highest level of expression in stems undergoing wood formation. Activity assays of recombinant proteins demonstrated that all twelve PtrXOAT proteins were able to transfer acetyl groups from acetyl CoA onto a xylohexaose acceptor with PtrXOAT1, PtrXOAT2, PtrXOAT3, PtrXOAT11 and PtrXOAT12 having the highest activity. Structural analysis of the PtrXOAT-catalyzed reaction products using 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed that PtrXOAT1, PtrXAOT2 and PtrXOAT3 mediated 2-O- and 3-O-monoacetylation and 2,3-di-O-acetylation of xylosyl residues and PtrXOAT11 and PtrXOAT12 only catalyzed 2-O- and 3-O-monoacetylation of xylosyl residues. Of the twelve PtrXOATs, only PtrXOAT9 and PtrXOAT10 were capable of transferring acetyl groups onto the O-3 position of 2-O-glucuronic acid-substituted xylosyl residues. Furthermore, when expressed in the Arabidopsis eskimo1 mutant, PtrXOAT1, PtrXAOT2 and PtrXOAT3 were able to rescue the defects in xylan acetylation. Together, these results demonstrate that the twelve PtrXOATs are acetyltransferases with different roles in xylan acetylation in P. trichocarpa."
"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a common method for discovery of gene-disease relationships, in particular for complex diseases like Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The experience with GWAS analysis has revealed that the genetic risk for complex diseases involves cumulative, small effects of many genes and only some genes with a moderate effect. In order to explore the complexity of the relationships between T2DM genes and their potential function at the process level as effected by polymorphism effects, a secondary analysis of a GWAS meta-analysis is presented. Network analysis, pathway information and integration of different types of biological information such as eQTLs and gene-environment interactions are used to elucidate the biological context of the genetic variants and to perform an analysis based on data visualization. We selected a T2DM dataset from a GWAS meta-analysis, and extracted 1,971 SNPs associated with T2DM. We mapped 580 SNPs to 360 genes, and then selected 460 pathways containing these genes from the curated collection of WikiPathways. We then created and analyzed SNP-gene and SNP-gene-pathway network modules in Cytoscape. A focus on genes with robust connections to pathways permitted identification of many T2DM pertinent pathways. However, numerous genes lack literature evidence of association with T2DM. We also speculate on the genes in specific network structures obtained in the SNP-gene network, such as gene-SNP-gene modules. Finally, we selected genes relevant to T2DM from our SNP-gene-pathway network, using different sources that reveal gene-environment interactions and eQTLs. We confirmed functions relevant to T2DM for many genes and have identified some-LPL and APOB-that require further validation to clarify their involvement in T2DM."
"Recent shifts in the ecological condition of Walden Pond, MA, are of potentially wide interest due to the lake's importance as a cultural, historical, and recreational resource in addition to its scientific value as an indicator of local and global environmental change. Algal microfossils in six sediment cores document changes in hydroclimate and trophic status of the lake during the last 1800 years and extend two previous sediment core records of shorter length. Low percentages of planktonic diatoms in the longest cores (WAL-3, WAL-15) indicate shallowing and/or greater water clarity associated with a relatively arid interval during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, ca. A.D. 1150-1300, Cultural eutrophication of the lake since the A.D. 1920s caused diatoms in the genera Asterionella and Synedra to increase in relative abundance at the expense of Cyclotella, Discostella, and the chrysophyte alga Mallomonas allorgei. Percentages of Asterionella and Synedra have remained fairly stable since A.D. 2000 when a previous sediment core study was conducted, but scaled chrysophytes have become more numerous. These findings suggest that, although mitigation efforts have curtailed anthropogenic nutrient inputs to Walden Pond, the lake has not returned to the pre-impact condition described by Henry David Thoreau and may become increasingly vulnerable to further changes in water quality in a warmer and possibly wetter future."
"Cells use thousands of regulatory sequences to recruit transcription factors (TFs) and produce specific transcriptional outcomes. Since TFs bind degenerate DNA sequences, discriminating functional TF binding sites (TFBSs) from background sequences represents a significant challenge. Here, we show that a Drosophila regulatory element that activates Epidermal Growth Factor signaling requires overlapping, low-affinity TFBSs for competing TFs (Pax2 and Senseless) to ensure cell- and segment-specific activity. Testing available TF binding models for Pax2 and Senseless, however, revealed variable accuracy in predicting such low-affinity TFBSs. To better define parameters that increase accuracy, we developed a method that systematically selects subsets of TFBSs based on predicted affinity to generate hundreds of position-weight matrices (PWMs). Counterintuitively, we found that degenerate PWMs produced from datasets depleted of high-affinity sequences were more accurate in identifying both low- and high-affinity TFBSs for the Pax2 and Senseless TFs. Taken together, these findings reveal how TFBS arrangement can be constrained by competition rather than cooperativity and that degenerate models of TF binding preferences can improve identification of biologically relevant low affinity TFBSs."
"Epidemiological studies have found that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and TN inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) are associated with lower frequency and duration of breast-feeding compared to non-TNBC and non-TN IBC, respectively. Limited breast-feeding could reflect abrupt or premature involution and contribute to a ""primed"" stroma that is permissive to the migration of cancer cells typical of IBC. We hypothesized that gene expression related to abrupt mammary gland involution after forced weaning may be enriched in the tissues of IBC patients and, if so, provide a potential correlation between limited breast-feeding and the development of aggressive breast cancer.We utilized the Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) program to cluster significant signatures from two independent studies that analyzed gene expression at multiple time-points of mouse mammary gland involution. Using 10 significant signatures, we performed gene ontology analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on training and validation sets from human breast cancer gene expression data to identify specific genes that are enriched in IBC compared to non-IBC and in TN compared to non-TN in IBC and non-IBC groups.Examining the combined data, we identified 10 involution gene clusters (Inv1-10) that share time-dependent regulation after forced weaning. Inv5 was the only cluster significantly enriched in IBC in the training and validation set (nominal p-values <0.05) and only by unadjusted p-values (FDR q-values 0.26 and 0.46 respectively). Eight genes in Inv5 are upregulated in both the training and validation sets in IBC. Combining the training and validation sets, both Inv5 and Inv6 have nominal p-values <0.05 and q-values 0.39 and 0.20, respectively. The time course for both clusters includes genes that change within 12 hours after forced weaning.Results from this in silico study suggest correlation between molecular events during abrupt involution and aggressive breast cancer. Specifically, candidate genes from Inv5 merit functional investigation regarding the role of limited breast-feeding in IBC development."
"Inhibition of the phospholipid phosphatase and tumor suppressor PTEN leads to excessive polarized cell growth during directed cell migration and neurite outgrowth. These processes require the precise regulation of both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. While PTEN is known to regulate actin dynamics through phospholipid modulation, whether and how PTEN regulates microtubule dynamics is unknown. Here, we show that depletion of PTEN leads to elevated levels of stable and post-translationally modified (detyrosinated) microtubules in fibroblasts and developing neurons. Further, PTEN depletion enhanced axon outgrowth, which was rescued by reducing the level of detyrosinated microtubules. These data demonstrate a novel role of PTEN in regulating the microtubule cytoskeleton. They further show a novel function of detyrosinated microtubules in axon outgrowth. Specifically, PTEN suppresses axon outgrowth by down-regulating the level of detyrosinated microtubules. Our results suggest that PTEN's role in preventing excessive cell growth in cancerous and neurodevelopmental phenotypes is partially exerted by stabilization and detyrosination of the microtubule cytoskeleton."
"Biologists determine experimental effects by perturbing biological entities or units. When done appropriately, independent replication of the entity-intervention pair contributes to the sample size (N) and forms the basis of statistical inference. If the wrong entity-intervention pair is chosen, an experiment cannot address the question of interest. We surveyed a random sample of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were applied to parents and effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory authorities provide clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found that only 22% of studies (95% CI = 17%-29%) replicated the correct entity-intervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Nearly half of the studies (46%, 95% CI = 38%-53%) had pseudoreplication while 32% (95% CI = 26%-39%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication artificially inflates the sample size, and thus the evidence for a scientific claim, resulting in false positives. We argue that distinguishing between biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and provide concrete examples of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental designs."
"Genome wide studies based on conventional molecular tools and upcoming omics technologies are beginning to gain functional applications in the control and prevention of diseases in teleosts fish. Herein, we provide insights into current progress and prospects in the use genomics studies for the control and prevention of fish diseases. Metagenomics has emerged to be an important tool used to identify emerging infectious diseases for the timely design of rational disease control strategies, determining microbial compositions in different aquatic environments used for fish farming and the use of host microbiota to monitor the health status of fish. Expounding the use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as therapeutic agents against different pathogens as well as elucidating their role in tissue regeneration is another vital aspect of genomics studies that had taken precedent in recent years. In vaccine development, prospects made include the identification of highly immunogenic proteins for use in recombinant vaccine designs as well as identifying gene signatures that correlate with protective immunity for use as benchmarks in optimizing vaccine efficacy. Progress in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping is beginning to yield considerable success in identifying resistant traits against some of the highly infectious diseases that have previously ravaged the aquaculture industry. Altogether, the synopsis put forth shows that genomics studies are beginning to yield positive contribution in the prevention and control of fish diseases in aquaculture."
"Over the past decade, evidence has identified a link between protein aggregation, RNA biology, and a subset of degenerative diseases. An important feature of these disorders is the cytoplasmic or nuclear aggregation of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Redistribution of RBPs, such as the human TAR DNA-binding 43 protein (TDP-43) from the nucleus to cytoplasmic inclusions is a pathological feature of several diseases. Indeed, sporadic and familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal lobar degeneration share as hallmarks ubiquitin-positive inclusions. Recently, the wide spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by RBPs functions' alteration and loss was collectively named proteinopathies. Here, we show that TBPH (TAR DNA-binding protein-43 homolog), theDrosophilaortholog of human TDP-43 TAR DNA-binding protein-43, interacts with the arcRNA hsr? and with hsr?-associated hnRNPs. Additionally, we found that the loss of the omega speckles remodeler ISWI (Imitation SWI) changes the TBPH sub-cellular localization to drive a TBPH cytoplasmic accumulation. Our results, hence, identify TBPH as a new component of omega speckles and highlight a role of chromatin remodelers in hnRNPs nuclear compartmentalization."
"Environmental sustainability is one of the key issues in building management. In Hong Kong, one of the initiatives is to reduce the operation hours of air-conditioning in buildings to cut down energy consumption. In this study, we reported a mold contamination case in a newly refurbished laboratory, in which the air-conditioner was switched from 24- to 18-h mode after refurbishment. In order to prevent mold recurrence, the air-conditioner was switched back to 24-h mode in the laboratory. During the mold investigation, visible mold patches in the laboratory were searched and then cultured, counted and identified. Building and environmental conditions were recorded, and used to deduce different causes of mold contamination. Eight contaminated sites including a wall, a bench, some metal and plastic surfaces and seven types of molds including twoCladosporiumspp., twoAspergillusspp., oneRhizopussp., oneTrichodermasp., and oneTritirachiumsp. were identified.Cladosporiumspp. were the most abundant and frequently found molds in the laboratory. The contaminated areas could have one to five different species on them. Based on the mold and environmental conditions, several scenarios causing the mold contamination were deduced, and different mold control measures were discussed to compare them with the current solution of using 24-h air-conditioning to control mold growth. This study highlights the importance of mold hygiene in sustainable building management."
"                    Staphylococcus aureus
is a major causative agent of infections associated with hospital environments, where antibiotic-resistant strains have emerged as a significant threat. Phage therapy could offer a safe and effective alternative to antibiotics. Phage preparations should comply with quality and safety requirements; therefore, it is important to develop efficient production control technologies. This study was conducted to develop and evaluate a rapid and reliable method for identifying staphylococcal bacteriophages, based on detecting their specific proteins using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiling that is among the suggested methods for meeting the regulations of pharmaceutical authorities. Five different phage purification techniques were tested in combination with two MALDI-TOF MS matrices. Phages, either purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation or as resuspended phage pellets, yielded mass spectra with the highest information value if ferulic acid was used as the MALDI matrix. Phage tail and capsid proteins yielded the strongest signals whereas the culture conditions had no effect on mass spectral quality. Thirty-seven phages fromMyoviridae,SiphoviridaeorPodoviridaefamilies were analysed, including 23 siphophages belonging to the International Typing Set for human strains ofS. aureus, as well as phages in preparations produced by Microgen, Bohemia Pharmaceuticals and MB Pharma. The data obtained demonstrate that MALDI-TOF MS can be used to effectively distinguish betweenStaphylococcus-specific bacteriophages."
"Exosomes are small vesicles which are produced by the cells and released into the surrounding space. They can transfer biomolecules into recipient cells. The main goal of the work was to study the exosome involvement in the cell transfer of hormonal resistance. The experiments were performed on in vitro cultured estrogen-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cells and MCF-7 sublines resistant to SERM tamoxifen and/or biguanide metformin, which exerts its anti-proliferative effect, at least in a part, via the suppression of estrogen machinery. The exosomes were purified by differential ultracentrifugation, cell response to tamoxifen was determined by MTT test, and the level and activity of signaling proteins were determined by Western blot and reporter analysis. We found that the treatment of the parent MCF-7 cells with exosomes from the resistant cells within 14 days lead to the partial resistance of the MCF-7 cells to antiestrogen drugs. The primary resistant cells and the cells with the exosome-induced resistance were characterized with these common features: decrease in ER&alpha; activity and parallel activation of Akt and AP-1, NF-&kappa;B, and SNAIL1 transcriptional factors. In general, we evaluate the established results as the evidence of the possible exosome involvement in the transferring of the hormone/metformin resistance in breast cancer cells."
"Metabolically healthy (MH) and metabolically unhealthy (MUH) phenotypes can be present in any subject independently of their body mass index (BMI). However, factors related to the presence of these phenotypes are poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this cross-sectional study is to describe the prevalence and characteristics associated with the MH and MUH phenotypes in Mexican subjects with different BMI categories. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were evaluated after 12 h of fasting. HMW (High Molecular Weight) adiponectin and insulin levels were measured by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). A total of 345 subjects were included, of which, 73.9% were women. The prevalence of the MH phenotype was 69.9%, 46.7%, and 19% in normal weight, overweight, and obesity, respectively. ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis showed that the waist circumference demonstrated a statistical significance (p< 0.01) in detecting the MUH phenotype in each BMI group only in women. Furthermore, subjects with lower HMW adiponectin levels showed a 2.1 increased risk of presenting the MUH phenotype. In conclusion, in this Mexican population, waist circumference was an anthropometric parameter that identified women with the MUH phenotype in all BMI categories and hypoadiponectinemia was a risk factor for the presence of this phenotype."
"The present study compares the effects of two dietary strawberry extracts rich in monomeric (ME) or dimeric (DE) ellagitannins (ETs) on gastrointestinal, blood and tissue biomarkers in Wistar rats fed high-fructose diets. Both strawberry extracts beneficially affect the antioxidant status and lipid profile of the liver and serum. The ME extract shows a greater ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation in kidneys, more effectively decreases serum and liver triglycerides, and exerts greater anti-inflammatory effects in blood serum than the DE extract. The DE extract significantly reduces the activity of microbial enzymes in the cecum. These effects might be associated with higher cecum and urine levels of ET metabolites in rats fed with ME than in rats fed with DE. In conclusion, the diet-induced fructose-related disturbances observed in biochemical parameters are regulated by both extracts; nevertheless, the beneficial effects of the ME extract are mostly associated with systemic parameters, while those of the DE extracts are associated with local microbial activity."
"Mycotoxins are major food contaminants affecting global food security, especially in low and middle-income countries. The European Union (EU) funded project, MycoKey, focuses on &ldquo;Integrated and innovative key actions for mycotoxin management in the food and feed chains&rdquo; and the right to safe food through mycotoxin management strategies and regulation, which are fundamental to minimizing the unequal access to safe and sufficient food worldwide. As part of the MycoKey project, a Mycotoxin Charter (charter.mycokey.eu) was launched to share the need for global harmonization of mycotoxin legislation and policies and to minimize human and animal exposure worldwide, with particular attention to less developed countries that lack effective legislation. This document is in response to a demand that has built through previous European Framework Projects&mdash;MycoGlobe and MycoRed&mdash;in the previous decade to control and reduce mycotoxin contamination worldwide. All suppliers, participants and beneficiaries of the food supply chain, for example, farmers, consumers, stakeholders, researchers, members of civil society and government and so forth, are invited to sign this charter and to support this initiative."
"Seminal plasma proteins are relevant for sperm functionality and some appear responsible for establishing sperm interactions with the various environments along the female genital tract towards the oocyte. In recent years, research has focused on characterizing the role of these proteins in the context of reproductive biology, fertility diagnostics and treatment of related problems. Herein, we focus on the main protein of bovine seminal plasma, PDC-109 (BSP-A1/-A2), which by virtue of its lectin properties is involved in fertilization. By means of surface plasmon resonance, the interaction of PDC-109 with a panel of the most relevant glycosidic epitopes of mammals has been qualitatively and quantitatively characterized, and a higher affinity for carbohydrates containing fucose has been observed, in line with previous studies. Additionally, using the orthogonal technique of Carbohydrate REcognition Domain EXcision-Mass Spectrometry (CREDEX-MS), the recognition domain of the interaction complexes between PDC-109 and all fucosylated disaccharides [(Fuc-&alpha;1,(3,4,6)-GlcNAc)] has been defined, revealing the specific glycotope and the peptide domain likely to act as the PDC-109 carbohydrate binding site."
"Obesity is associated with inflammatory changes and accumulation and phenotype polarization of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Obese pregnant women have alterations in adipose tissue composition, but a detailed description of macrophage population is not available. In this study, we characterized macrophage populations in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from pregnant women with normal, overweight, and obese pregestational weight. Immunophenotyping of macrophages from VAT biopsies was performed by flow cytometry using CD45 and CD14 as markers of hematopoietic and monocyte linage, respectively, while HLA-DR, CD11c, CD163, and CD206 were used as pro- and anti-inflammatory markers. Adipocyte number and size were evaluated by light microscopy. The results show that pregnant women that were overweight and obese during the pregestational period had adipocyte hypertrophy. Two different macrophage populations in VAT were identified: recruited macrophages (CD45?CD14?), and a novel population lacking CD45, which was considered to be a resident macrophages subset (CD45&minus;CD14?). The number of resident HLA&minus;DRlow/&minus;macrophages showed a negative correlation with body mass index (BMI). Both resident and recruited macrophages from obese women expressed higher CD206 levels. CD11c expression was higher in resident HLA-DR? macrophages from obese women. A strong correlation between CD206 and CD11c markers and BMI was observed. Our findings show that being overweight and obese in the pregestational period is associated with adipocyte hypertrophy and specific ATMs populations in VAT."
"Gene rearrangements resulting in the aberrant activity of tyrosine kinases have been identified as drivers of oncogenesis in a variety of cancers. The tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) family of tyrosine receptor kinases is emerging as an important target for cancer therapeutics. The TRK family contains three members, TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, and these proteins are encoded by the genes NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3, respectively. To activate TRK receptors, neurotrophins bind to the extracellular region stimulating dimerization, phosphorylation, and activation of downstream signaling pathways. Major known downstream pathways include RAS/MAPK/ERK, PLC&gamma;, and PI3K/Akt. While being rare in most cancers, TRK fusions with other proteins have been well-established as oncogenic events in specific malignancies, including glioblastoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and secretory breast carcinomas. TRK protein amplification as well as alternative splicing events have also been described as contributors to cancer pathogenesis. For patients harboring alterations in TRK expression or activity, TRK inhibition emerges as an important therapeutic target. To date, multiple trials testing TRK-inhibiting compounds in various cancers are underway. In this review, we will summarize the current therapeutic trials for neoplasms involving NTKR gene alterations, as well as the promises and setbacks that are associated with targeting gene fusions."
"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used as antibacterial agents, but their antibacterial durability and the influence by storage conditions have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, AgNPs were produced using a picosecond laser and stored under three different conditions: daylight, dark and cold (4 °C). The antibacterial effects of the laser AgNPs were examined againstEscherichia coliin either a 14-day interval (frequent air exposure) or a 45-day interval (less frequent air exposure) using a well-diffusion method until the antibacterial effects disappeared. Results showed that the antibacterial activity of the laser generated AgNPs lasted 266 to 405 days. Frequent air exposure increased particle oxidation as measured by high-angle annular dark-field detector for scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and X-ray energy dispersive (EDX) spectroscopy, and reduced the antibacterial duration by about 13 weeks. Compared to the chemically produced AgNPs, the antibacterial effect of the laser AgNPs lasted over 100 days longer when tested in the 45-day interval, but was susceptible to oxidation when frequently exposed to the air. The laser generated AgNPs had lower antibacterial activity when stored in cold compared to that stored at room temperature. This study demonstrated the long lasting antibacterial durability of the laser generated AgNPs. Such information could help design future medical applications for the AgNPs."
"                    Dianthus
is a large genus containing many species with high ornamental economic value. Extensive breeding strategies permitted an exploration of an improvement in the quality of cultivated carnation, particularly in flowers. However, little is known on the molecular mechanisms of flower development in carnation. Here, we report the identification and description of MADS-box genes in carnation (DcaMADS) with a focus on those involved in flower development and organ identity determination. In this study, 39 MADS-box genes were identified from the carnation genome and transcriptome by the phylogenetic analysis. These genes were categorized into four subgroups (30 MIKCc, two MIKC*, two M?, and five M?). The MADS-box domain, gene structure, and conserved motif compositions of the carnation MADS genes were analysed. Meanwhile, the expression ofDcaMADSgenes were significantly different in stems, leaves, and flower buds. Further studies were carried out for exploring the expression ofDcaMADSgenes in individual flower organs, and some crucialDcaMADSgenes correlated with their putative function were validated. Finally, a new expression pattern ofDcaMADSgenes in flower organs of carnation was provided: sepal (three class E genes and two class A genes), petal (two class B genes, two class E genes, and one SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP)), stamen (two class B genes, two class E genes, and two class C), styles (two class E genes and two class C), and ovary (two class E genes, two class C, one AGAMOUS-LIKE 6 (AGL6), one SEEDSTICK (STK), oneB sister, oneSVP, and oneM?). This result proposes a model in floral organ identity of carnation and it may be helpful to further explore the molecular mechanism of flower organ identity in carnation."
"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play important roles in various aspects of the structural and functional organization of cells; thus, detecting PPIs is one of the most important issues in current molecular biology. Although much effort has been devoted to using high-throughput techniques to identify protein-protein interactions, the experimental methods are both time-consuming and costly. In addition, they yield high rates of false positive and false negative results. In addition, most of the proposed computational methods are limited in information about protein homology or the interaction marks of the protein partners. In this paper, we report a computational method only using the information from protein sequences. The main improvements come from novel protein sequence representation by combing the continuous and discrete wavelet transforms and from adopting weighted sparse representation-based classifier (WSRC). The proposed method was used to predict PPIs from three different datasets: yeast, human andH. pylori. In addition, we employed the prediction model trained on the PPIs dataset of yeast to predict the PPIs of six datasets of other species. To further evaluate the performance of the prediction model, we compared WSRC with the state-of-the-art support vector machine classifier. When predicting PPIs of yeast, humans andH. pyloridataset, we obtained high average prediction accuracies of 97.38%, 98.92% and 93.93% respectively. In the cross-species experiments, most of the prediction accuracies are over 94%. These promising results show that the proposed method is indeed capable of obtaining higher performance in PPIs detection."
"Arsenic (As) and chromium (Cr) are two contaminants that are detected in aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Using the spotted salamander, Ambystoma maculatum, to assess impacts from these contaminants may be advantageous as adults live and breed in such environments. Adult amphibians typically exhibit elevated tissue concentrations of contaminants present in their environment, while larval stages were found to exhibit increased sensitivity to pollutants. From January through March of 2015, during the spring breeding season, 5 adults and approximately 32 egg masses were collected from a local breeding site. Field levels of As and Cr ranged from 5.99 to 8.88 µg/L and 1.45 to 2 µg/L, respectively, while mean adult As tissue concentrations were 56.74 µg/g dry weight for heart, 0.92 µg/g for liver, and 1.21 µg/g for tail tissue. Mean tissue concentrations for Cr were 87.64 µg/g for heart, 1.47 µg/g for liver, and 6.92 µg/g for tail. Developing larvae that were collected from the field and exposed in a lab setting for 12 d to 0.2 or 20 mg/L of either As or Cr displayed little DNA damage attributed to As, but marked damage due to exposure to 20 mg/L Cr when assessed using the comet assay. Exposure to a mixture of either 0.25:0.1 or 25:10 mg/L As and Cr resulted in significant DNA damage at the lower concentration of 0.25:0.1 mg/L. As adult spotted salamanders were found to possess high concentrations of these contaminants in cardiac tissue, and larvae were shown to be susceptible to DNA damage from increased exposures, assessing impacts and potential declines of amphibian populations exposed to As and Cr is needed."
"Glucose metabolism is regulated by insulin, which is produced from ?-cells in the pancreas. Because insulin is secreted into vessels in response to blood glucose, vascular structures of the pancreas, especially the relationship between vessels and ?-cells, are important for physiological and pathological glucose metabolism. Here, we developed a system to visualize vessels surrounding mature ?-cells expressing transcription factor MafA in a three-dimensional manner. Optical clearing of the pancreas prevented light scattering of fluorescence driven by the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-mafA promoter in ?-cells. Reconstruction of confocal images demonstrated mature ?-cells and the glomerular-like structures of ?-cell vasculatures labeled with DyLight 488-conjugated lectin in normal mice as well as in low-dose streptozotocin-injected diabetes model mice with reduced ?-cell mass. This technological innovation of organ imaging can be used to investigate morphological changes in vascular structures during transplantation, regeneration and diabetes development."
"Strains of Eggerthella lenta are capable of oxidation-reduction reactions capable of oxidizing and epimerizing bile acid hydroxyl groups. Several genes encoding these enzymes, known as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH) have yet to be identified. It is also uncertain whether the products of E. lenta bile acid metabolism are further metabolized by other members of the gut microbiota. We characterized a novel human fecal isolate identified as E. lenta strain C592. The complete genome of E. lenta strain C592 was sequenced and comparative genomics with the type strain (DSM 2243) revealed high conservation, but some notable differences. E. lenta strain C592 falls into group III, possessing 3?, 3?, 7?, and 12?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) activity, as determined by mass spectrometry of thin layer chromatography (TLC) separated metabolites of primary and secondary bile acids. Incubation of E. lenta oxo-bile acid and iso-bile acid metabolites with whole-cells of the high-activity bile acid 7?-dehydroxylating bacterium, Clostridium scindens VPI 12708, resulted in minimal conversion of oxo-derivatives to lithocholic acid (LCA). Further, Iso-chenodeoxycholic acid (iso-CDCA; 3?,7?-dihydroxy-5?-cholan-24-oic acid) was not metabolized by C. scindens. We then located a gene encoding a novel 12?-HSDH in E. lenta DSM 2243, also encoded by strain C592, and the recombinant purified enzyme was characterized and substrate-specificity determined. Genomic analysis revealed genes encoding an Rnf complex (rnfABCDEG), an energy conserving hydrogenase (echABCDEF) complex, as well as what appears to be a complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Our prediction that by changing the gas atmosphere from nitrogen to hydrogen, bile acid oxidation would be inhibited, was confirmed. These results suggest that E. lenta is an important bile acid metabolizing gut microbe and that the gas atmosphere may be an important and overlooked regulator of bile acid metabolism in the gut."
"? Host responses to infection with novel pathogens are costly and require trade-offs among physiologic systems. One such pathogen is the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd) that causes white-nose syndrome (WNS) and has led to mass mortality of hibernating bats in eastern North America. Although infection with Pd does not always result in death, we hypothesized that bats that survive infection suffer significant consequences that negatively impact the ability of females to reproduce. To understand the physiologic consequences of surviving infection with Pd, we assessed differences in wing damage, mass-specific resting metabolic rate, and reproductive rate between little brown myotis ( Myotis lucifugus) that survived a winter in captivity after inoculation with Pd (WNS survivors) and comparable, uninfected bats. Survivors of WNS had significantly more damaged wing tissue and displayed elevated mass-specific metabolic rates compared with Pd-uninfected bats after emergence from hibernation. The WNS survivors and Pd-uninfected bats did not significantly differ in their reproductive capacity, at least in captivity. However, our metabolic data demonstrated greater energetic costs during spring in WNS survivors compared with uninfected bats, which may have led to other consequences for postpartum fitness. We suggest that, after surviving the energetic constraints of winter, temperate hibernating bats infected with Pd faced a second energetic bottleneck after emerging from hibernation."
"Alveolar bone is a mechanosensitive tissue that provides structural support for teeth. Alveolar bone loss is common with aging, menopause, tooth loss, and periodontitis and can lead to additional tooth loss, reduced denture fixation, and challenges in placing dental implants. The current studies suggest that sclerostin and DKK1, which are established osteocyte-derived inhibitors of bone formation, contribute to alveolar bone loss associated with estrogen ablation and edentulism in rats. Estrogen-deficient ovariectomized rats showed significant mandibular bone loss that was reversed by systemic administration of sclerostin antibody (SAB) alone and in combination with DKK1 antibody (DAB). Osteocytes in the dentate and edentulous rat maxilla expressed Sost (sclerostin) and Dkk1 (DKK1) mRNA, and molar extraction appeared to acutely increase DKK1 expression. In a chronic rat maxillary molar extraction model, systemic SAB administration augmented the volume and height of atrophic alveolar ridges, effects that were enhanced by coadministering DAB. SAB and SAB+DAB also fully reversed bone loss that developed in the opposing mandible as a result of hypo-occlusion. In both treatment studies, alveolar bone augmentation with SAB or SAB+DAB was accompanied by increased bone mass in the postcranial skeleton. Jaw bone biomechanics showed that intact sclerostin-deficient mice exhibited stronger and denser mandibles as compared with wild-type controls. These studies show that sclerostin inhibition, with and without DKK1 coinhibition, augmented alveolar bone volume and architecture in rats with alveolar bone loss. These noninvasive approaches may have utility for the conservative augmentation of alveolar bone."
"A rare example of chemospecificity in the tandem Diels-Alder reaction of activated alkynes and bis-dienes has been revealed. The reaction between bis-furyl dienes and DMAD occurs at 25-80 °C and leads to kinetically controlled ""pincer"" adducts, 4a,8a-disubstituted 1,4:5,8-diepoxynaphthalenes. On the contrary, only thermodynamically controlled ""domino"" adducts (2,3-disubstituted 1,4:5,8-diepoxynaphthalenes) are formed in the same reaction at 140 °C. The ""pincer"" adducts can be transformed to the ""domino"" adducts at heating. The rate constants for reactions of both types were calculated using dynamic1H NMR spectroscopy."
"2-Deoxyglucose is a non-metabolizable glucose analog currently in clinical trials to determine its efficacy in enhancing the therapeutic effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy of several types of cancers. It is thought to preferentially kill cancer cells by inhibiting glycolysis because cancer cells are more dependent on glycolysis for their energy needs than normal cells. However, we found that 2-Deoxyglucose's toxicity in cancer cells is mediated by the enzymatic activities of AKR1B1 and/or AKR1B10 (AKR1Bs), which are often overexpressed in cancer cells. Our results show that 2-Deoxyglucose kills cancer cells because, in the process of being reduced by AKR1Bs, depletion of their co-factor NADPH leads to the depletion of GSH and cell death. Furthermore, we demonstrated that compounds that are better substrates for AKR1Bs than 2-Deoxyglucose are more effective than 2-Deoxyglucose in killing cancer cells that overexpressed these two enzymes. Since cancer cells can be induced to overexpress AKR1Bs, the anti-cancer mechanism we identified can be applied to treat a large variety of cancers. This should greatly facilitate the development of novel anti-cancer drugs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
"Despite accumulating evidence that evolution can be predictable, studies quantifying the predictability of evolution remain rare. Here, we measured the predictability of genomewide evolutionary changes associated with a recent host shift in the Melissa blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa). We asked whether and to what extent genome-wide patterns of evolutionary change in nature could be predicted (1) by comparisons among instances of repeated evolution, and (2) from SNP × performance associations in a lab experiment. We delineated the genetic loci (SNPs) most strongly associated with host use in two L. melissa lineages that colonized alfalfa. Whereas most SNPs were strongly associated with host use in none or one of these lineages, we detected a ~two-fold excess of SNPs associated with host use in both lineages. Similarly, we found that host-associated SNPs in nature could also be partially predicted from SNP × performance (survival and weight) associations in a lab rearing experiment.But the extent of overlap, and thus degree of predictability, was somewhat reduced. Although we were able to predict (to a modest extent) the SNPs most strongly associated with host use in nature (in terms of parallelism and from the experiment), we had little to no ability to predict the direction of evolutionary change during the colonization of alfalfa.Our results show that different aspects of evolution associated with recent adaptation can be more or less predictable, and highlight how stochastic and deterministic processes interact to drive patterns of genome-wide evolutionary change.

"This review compares two states that lower energy expenditure: non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and torpor. Knowledge on mechanisms common to these states, and particularly on the role of adenosine in NREM sleep, may ultimately open the possibility of inducing a synthetic torpor-like state in humans for medical applications and long-term space travel. To achieve this goal, it will be important, in perspective, to extend the study to other hypometabolic states, which, unlike torpor, can also be experienced by humans."
"Porphyromonas gingivalis, an opportunistic pathogen usurps gingival epithelial cells (GECs) as primary intracellular niche for its colonization in the oral mucosa. However, the precise characterization of the intracellular trafficking and fate of P. gingivalis in GECs remains incomplete. Therefore, we employed high-resolution three-dimensional-transmission-electron-microscopy to determine the subcellular location of P. gingivalis in human primary GECs upon invasion. Serial sections of infected-GECs and their tomographic reconstruction depicted ER-rich-double-membrane autophagosomal-vacuoles harboring P. gingivalis. Western-blotting and fluorescence confocal microscopy showed that P. gingivalis significantly induces LC3-lipidation in a time-dependent-manner and co-localizes with LC3, ER-lumen-protein Bip, or ER-tracker, which are major components of the phagophore membrane. Furthermore, GECs that were infected with FMN-green-fluorescent transformant-strain (PgFbFP) and selectively permeabilized by digitonin showed rapidly increasing large numbers of double-membrane-vacuolar-P. gingivalis over 24 hours of infection with a low-ratio of cytosolically free-bacteria. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy using 3-methyladenine or ATG5 siRNA significantly reduced the viability of intracellular P. gingivalis in GECs as determined by an antibiotic-protection-assay. Lysosomal marker, LAMP-1, showed a low-degree colocalization with P. gingivalis (?20%). PgFbFP was used to investigate the fate of vacuolar- versus cytosolic-P. gingivalis by their association with ubiquitin-binding-adaptor-proteins, NDP52 and p62. Only cytosolic-P. gingivalis had a significant association with both markers, which suggests cytosolically-free bacteria are likely destined to the lysosomal-degradation pathway whereas the vacuolar-P. gingivalis survives. Therefore, the results reveal a novel mechanism for P. gingivalis survival in GECs by harnessing host autophagy machinery to establish a successful replicative niche and persistence in the oral mucosa."
"Lymphoid recovery following myeloablative stem cell transplantation (SCT) displays a logistic pattern of exponential growth followed by a plateau. Within this logistic framework, lymphoid recovery is characterized by the parameters R (slope of ascent), a (time of maximal rate of ascent) and K (plateau), the 'steady-state' lymphocyte count. A retrospective analysis of allogeneic SCT performed from 2008 to 2013 was undertaken to compare lymphoid recovery and clinical outcomes in 131 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes. Using Prism software, a logistic curve was successfully fit to the absolute lymphocyte count recovery in all patients. Patients were classified according to the magnitude and rate of lymphoid recovery; pattern A achieved an absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) of >1000/?L by day 45, pattern B an ALC 500?<?x?<?1000/?L, and pattern C an ALC?<500/?L. Pattern A was characterized by a higher mean K (p?<?.0001) compared with patterns B and C. Patients with patterns B and C were more likely to have mixed T cell chimerism at 90 d following SCT (p?=?.01). There was a trend towards improved survival (and relapse-free survival) in those with pattern A and B at 1 year compared to pattern C (p?=?.073). There was no difference in cGVHD (p?=?.42) or relapse (p?=?.45) between pattern types. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), aGVHD, and all relapse were heralded by deviation from logistic behavior. Pattern C patients were more likely to require donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) (p?=?.017). Weaning of tacrolimus post-transplant was associated with a second, separate logistic expansion in some patients. This study demonstrated that lymphoid reconstitution follows a prototypical logistic recovery and that pattern observed correlates with T cell chimerism and need for DLI, and may influence survival."
"We investigated panobinostat 40?mg three times weekly in 35 adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Overall response rate and complete response were 17.1% and 11.4%, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 2.4 and 7.6 months, respectively. Calculated 12, 24 and 36 months PFS were 26%, 11% and 11%, respectively. Four patients who achieved a sustained CR, continued receiving panobinostat for an overall period of 44, 48, 50, 62 months. Thrombocytopenia grade 3 (5 patients) and 4 (24 patients) represented the main toxic effect, causing dose reduction or treatment suspension in 19 patients. Genomic analysis was unable to identify any relationship between mutations and response; TP53 mutation appeared not to impact the clinical outcome. Overall, panobinostat has a modest activity in R/R DLBCL patients, however it can induce very long lasting responses in some cases. Thrombocytopenia frequently limits the use of this agent."
"Inhibition of Mdm2 function is a validated approach to restore p53 activity for cancer therapy; nevertheless, inhibitors of Mdm2 such as Nutlin-3 have certain limitations, suggesting that additional targets in this pathway need to be further elucidated. Our finding that the Herpesvirus-Associated Ubiquitin-Specific Protease (HAUSP, also called USP7) interacts with the p53/Mdm2 protein complex, was one of the first examples that deubiquitinases (DUBs) exhibit a specific role in regulating protein stability. Here, we show that inhibitors of HAUSP and Nutlin-3 can synergistically activate p53 function and induce p53-dependent apoptosis in human cancer cells. Notably, HAUSP can also target the N-Myc oncoprotein in a p53-independent manner. Moreover, newly synthesized HAUSP inhibitors are more potent than the commercially available inhibitors to suppress N-Myc activities in p53 mutant cells for growth suppression. Taken together, our study demonstrates the utility of HAUSP inhibitors to target cancers in both a p53-depdentent and -independent manner."
"To provide biologic insights into mechanisms underlying myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) we evaluated the CD34+marrow cells transcriptome using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We demonstrated significant differential gene expression profiles (GEPs) between MDS and normal and identified 41 disease classifier genes. Additionally, two main clusters of GEPs distinguished patients based on their major clinical features, particularly between those whose disease remained stable versus patients who transformed into acute myeloid leukemia within 12 months. The genes whose expression was associated with disease outcome were involved in functional pathways and biologic processes highly relevant for MDS. Combined with exomic analysis we identified differential isoform usage of genes in MDS mutational subgroups, with consequent dysregulation of distinct biologic functions. This combination of clinical, transcriptomic and exomic findings provides valuable understanding of mechanisms underlying MDS and its progression to a more aggressive stage and also facilitates prognostic characterization of MDS patients."
"Mind-body practices that elicit the relaxation response (RR) have been demonstrated to reduce blood pressure (BP) in essential hypertension (HTN) and may be an adjunct to antihypertensive drug therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the RR reduces BP remain undefined.Genomic determinants associated with responsiveness to an 8-week RR-based mind-body intervention for lowering HTN in 13 stage 1 hypertensive patients classified as BP responders and 11 as nonresponders were identified.Transcriptome analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells identified 1771 genes regulated by the RR in responders. Biological process- and pathway-based analysis of transcriptome data demonstrated enrichment in the following gene categories: immune regulatory pathways and metabolism (among downregulated genes); glucose metabolism, cardiovascular system development, and circadian rhythm (among upregulated genes). Further in silico estimation of cell abundance from the microarray data showed enrichment of the anti-inflammatory M2 subtype of macrophages in BP responders. Nuclear factor-?B, vascular endothelial growth factor, and insulin were critical molecules emerging from interactive network analysis.These findings provide the first insights into the molecular mechanisms that are associated with the beneficial effects of the RR on HTN."
"Sir Oliver Scott, a philanthropist and radiation biologist and, therefore, the epitome of a gentleman and a scholar, was an early Director of the BECC Radiobiology Research Unit at Mount Vernon. His tenure preceded that of Jack Fowler, with both contributing to basic, translational and clinical thought and application in radiation across the globe. With respect to this review, Fowler's name in particular has remained synonymous with the use of models, both animal and mathematical, that assess and quantify the biological mechanisms that underlie radiation-associated normal tissue toxicities. An understanding of these effects is critical to the optimal use of radiation therapy in the clinic; however, the role that basic sciences play in clinical practice has been undergoing considerable change in recent years, particularly in the U.S.A., where there has been a growing emphasis on engineering and imaging to improve radiation delivery, with empirical observations of clinical outcome taking the place of models underpinned by evidence from basic science experiments. In honour of Scott and Fowler's work, we have taken this opportunity to review how our respective fields of radiation biology and radiation physics have intertwined over the years, affecting the clinical use of radiation with respect to normal tissue outcomes. We discuss past and current achievements, with the hope of encouraging a revived interest in physics and biology as they relate to radiation oncology practice, since, like Scott and Fowler, we share the goal of improving the future outlook for cancer patients."
"The chick embryo has a long history in investigations of vertebrate limb development because of the ease with which its limbs can be experimentally manipulated. Early studies elucidated the fundamental embryology of the limb and identified the key signalling regions that govern its development. The chick limb became a leading model for exploring the concept of positional information and understanding how patterns of differentiated cells and tissues develop in vertebrate embryos. When developmentally important molecules began to be identified, experiments in chick limbs were crucial for bridging embryology and molecular biology. The embryological mechanisms and molecular basis of limb development are largely conserved in mammals, including humans, and uncovering these molecular networks provides links to clinical genetics. We emphasise the important contributions of naturally occurring chick mutants to elucidating limb embryology and identifying novel developmentally important genes. In addition, we consider how the chick limb has been used to study mechanisms involved in teratogenesis with a focus on thalidomide. These studies on chick embryos have given insights into how limb defects can be caused by both genetic changes and chemical insults and therefore are of great medical significance."
"While the external vertebrate body plan appears bilaterally symmetrical with respect to anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes, the internal organs are arranged with a striking and invariant left-right asymmetry. This laterality is important for normal body function, as alterations manifest as numerous human birth defect syndromes. The left-right axis is set up very early during embryogenesis by an initial and still poorly understood break in bilateral symmetry, followed by a cascade of molecular events that was discovered 20 years ago in the chick embryo model. This gene regulatory network leads to activation of the pitx2 gene on the left side of the embryo which ultimately establishes asymmetric organogenesis of the heart, gut, brain, and other organs. In this review, we highlight the crucial contributions of the avian model to the discovery of the differential transcriptional cascades operating on the Left and Right sides, as well as to the physiological events operating upstream of asymmetric gene expression. The chick was not only instrumental in the discovery of mechanisms behind left-right patterning, but stands poised to facilitate inroads into the most fundamental aspects that link asymmetry to the rest of evolutionary developmental biology."
"Michael Abercrombie is regarded as one of the principal pioneers of cell biology. Although Abercrombie began his career as an experimental embryologist, working on the avian organizer with C. H. Waddington, questions on how cells in culture migrate and interact dominated his career. Whilst studying the social behaviour of chick heart embryonic fibroblasts, Abercrombie identified a phenomenon whereby colliding cells collapse their protrusions towards the cell-cell contact upon a collision, preventing their continued migration. The cells then form protrusions away from the contact and, space permitting, migrate away from each other. This behaviour is now referred to as 'contact inhibition of locomotion' and has been identified within embryology as the driving force behind the directional migration of the neural crest and the dispersion patterning of haemocytes and Cajal-Retzius neurons. Furthermore, its loss between collisions of cancer cells and healthy cells is associated with metastasis. In this review we begin with an overview of Abercrombie's life and highlight some of his key publications. We then discuss Abercrombie's discovery of contact inhibition of locomotion, the roles which cell-cell adhesions, cell-matrix adhesions and the cytoskeleton play in facilitating this phenomenon, and the importance of contact inhibition of locomotion within the living organism."
"Absolute time elapsed since fertilization, or hours' incubation, is not a good measure of the precise degree of development of an embryo because there is considerable variation. The chick embryo benefits from a detailed, well defined staging system introduced by Hamburger and Hamilton in 1951, perhaps the most precise and detailed available for any species. This paper briefly reviews the background and legacy of this table, including the remarkable work of its predecessors, Mathias Duval and Franz Keibel. It also begs the question of why the mouse embryo still lacks a similarly precise classification."
"Here, I provide some recollections of my life, starting as a civil engineer in South Africa and how I gradually became interested in biology, particularly pattern formation. In retrospect, I think that my decision to work on chick embryos to study limb development back in 1966 turned out to be the right one. The principles discovered in these 50 years, both by my collaborators and by other colleagues, have established the principles of how the limb develops in higher vertebrates, including humans."
"After decades of research investment, techniques for the robust and efficient modification of the chicken genome are now with us. The biology of the chicken has provided many challenges, as have the methods by which transgenes can be readily, stably and functionally integrated into the genome. Now that these obstacles have been surmounted and the chicken has been 'updated' to a cutting-edge modern model organism, a future as a central and versatile model in developmental biology beckons. In this review, we describe recent advances in genetic modification of the chicken and some of the many transgenic models developed for the elucidation of the mechanisms of embryogenesis."
"Avian brain organization or brain Bauplan is identical with that of vertebrates in general. This essay visits avian studies that contained advances or discussions about brain organization, trying to explain critically what they contributed. In order to start from a specific background, the new prevailing paradigm as regards brain organization, the prosomeric model, is presented first. Next a brief historic survey is made of how ideas on this topic evolved from the start of modern neuromorphology at the end of the 19th century. Longitudinal zonal organization with or without transverse segmentation (neuromeres) was the first overall concept applied to the brain. The idea of neuromeric structure later decayed in favour of a columnar model. This emphasized functional correlations rather than causal developmental content, assimilating forebrain functions to hindbrain ones. Though it became prevalent in the post-world-war period of neuroscience, in the last decades of the 20th century advances in molecular biology allowed developmental genes to be mapped, and it became evident that gene expression patterns support the old neuromeric model rather than the columnar one. This was also corroborated by modern experimental approaches (fate-mapping and analysis of patterning)."
"Sensory placodes contribute to much of the sensory nervous system in the vertebrate head. They give rise to parts of the eye, ear and nose, as well as to the sensory ganglia that innervate the face, tongue, oesophagus and visceral tissues. Despite their diversity, during development placodes arise from a population of common progenitor cells, which are first specified at the border of the neural plate. The chick has been particularly instrumental in dissecting the timing of these events, and recent evidence has highlighted the close relationship of placode progenitors and precursors for neural crest cells and the central nervous system. This review focuses on the induction of placode progenitors by localised signalling events, and the transcriptional networks that lead to their specification."
"The neural crest is a multipotent and highly migratory cell type that contributes to many of the defining features of vertebrates, including the skeleton of the head and most of the peripheral nervous system. 150 years after the discovery of the neural crest, avian embryos remain one of the most important model organisms for studying neural crest development. In this review, we describe aspects of neural crest induction, migration and axial level differences, highlighting what is known about the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms. Past and emerging technologies continue to improve the resolution with which we can examine important questions of neural crest development, with modern avian molecular embryology continuing to make important contributions."
"Signalling pathways that regulate neural progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation have been identified. However, we know much less about how transduction of such signals is regulated within neuroepithelial cells to direct cell fate choice during mitosis and subsequent neuronal differentiation. Here we review recent advances in the experimentally amenable chick embryo, which reveal that this involves association of signalling pathway components with cell biological entities, including mitotic centrosomes and ciliary structures. This includes changing centrosomal localization of protein kinase A, which regulates Sonic hedgehog signalling and so neural progenitor status, and Mindbomb1, a mediator of Notch ligand activation, which promotes Notch signalling in neighbouring cells, and so is active in presumptive neurons. We further review cell biological events that underlie the later step of neuronal delamination, during which a newborn neuron detaches from its neighbouring cells and undergoes a process known as apical abscission. This involves inter-dependent actin and microtubule dynamics and includes dissociation of the centrosome from the ciliary membrane, which potentially alters the signalling repertoire of this now post-mitotic cell. Open questions and future directions are discussed along with technological advances which improve accuracy of gene manipulation, monitoring of protein dynamics and quantification of cell biological processes in living tissues."
"Our understanding of avian sex determination and gonadal development is derived primarily from the studies in the chicken. Analysis of gynandromorphic chickens and experimental chimeras indicate that sexual phenotype is at least partly cell autonomous in the chicken, with sexually dimorphic gene expression occurring in different tissue and different stages. Gonadal sex differentiation is just one of the many manifestations of sexual phenotype. As in other birds, the chicken has a ZZ male: ZW female sex chromosome system, in which the male is the homogametic sex. Most evidence favours a Z chromosome dosage mechanism underling chicken sex determination, with little evidence of a role for the W chromosome. Indeed, the W appears to harbour a small number of genes that are un-related to sexual development, but have been retained because they are dosage sensitive factors. As global Z dosage compensation is absent in birds, Z-linked genes may direct sexual development in different tissues (males having on average 1.5 to 2 times the expression level of females). In the embryonic gonads, the Z-linked DMRT1 gene plays a key role in testis development. Beyond the gonads, other combinations of Z-linked genes may govern sexual development, together with a role for sex steroid hormones. Gonadal DMRT1 is thought to activate other players in testis development, namely SOX9 and AMH, and the recently identified HEMGN gene. DMRT1 also represses ovarian pathway genes, such as FOXL2 and CYP19A1. A lower level of DMRT1 expression in the female gonads is compatible with activation of the ovarian pathway. Some outstanding questions include how the key testis and ovary genes, DMRT1 and FOXL2, are regulated. In addition, confirmation of the central role of these genes awaits genome editing approaches."
"This paper provides a brief account of some aspects of the career of Ruth Bellairs using selected examples from her research publications, with the emphasis being placed on the early stages of chick embryo development, and in particular, on cell migration. Topics include the role of Hensen's node, the vitelline membrane, the structure and segmentation of somites, the tail bud and the Wolffian duct. Her research approach has involved embryo culture, experimental surgery, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, time-lapse filming and immunostaining techniques."
"Striated muscle is the most abundant tissue in the body of vertebrates and it forms, together with the skeleton, the locomotory system required both for movement and the creation of the specific body shape of a species. Research on the embryonic development of muscles has a long tradition both in classical embryology and in molecular developmental biology. While the gene networks regulating muscle development have been discovered mostly in the mouse through genetics, our knowledge on cell lineages, muscle morphogenesis and tissue interactions regulating their formation is to a large extent based on the use of the avian model. This review highlights present knowledge of the development of skeletal muscle in vertebrate embryos. Special focus will be placed on the contributions from chicken and quail embryo model systems."
"When I was asked by the Chief Editor of the Int. J. Dev. Biol. to consider editing a Special Issue about ""the chick"", I was first hesitant, because I had already edited such an issue for another journal in 2004 (Mech. Dev. volume 121), when the sequence of the chick genome was first released (Stern, 2004, 2005). But at the same time I was surprised that this journal, well known for its Special Issues of which many have become important historical and literary land-marks to the developmental biology literature, had not yet produced a volume on what is probably the oldest developmental model system. Despite this, it is often forgotten that much of what we know (or think we know) about human developmental events is due to extrapolation from chick embryological studies."
"Comparative studies of sympatric species are essential for understanding behavioral and ecological adaptation as well as the mechanisms that can reduce resource competition to allow coexistence. François' langurs (Trachypithecus francoisi) and Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) are sympatric primate species found in the limestone seasonal rainforests of Nonggang Nature Reserve, southwestern Guangxi, China. To explore their different adaptation strategies, we collected data on diet using scan sampling at 15-min intervals. Our results revealed that François' langurs showed a more flexible diet composition than Assamese macaques. François' langurs increased dietary diversity and mature leaf consumption in response to seasonal scarcity of preferred young leaves and fruits, whereas Assamese macaques relied heavily on young bamboo leaves (Indocalamus calcicolus) in most months. These variations reflect the differences in digestive physiology, morphology, and the temporal and spatial distribution of food resources."
"Proton beam ranges derived from dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) images from a dual-spiral radiotherapy (RT)-specific CT scanner were assessed using Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations. Images from a dual-source and a twin-beam DECT scanner were also used to establish a comparison to the RT-specific scanner. Proton ranges extracted from conventional single-energy CT (SECT) were additionally performed to benchmark against literature values. Using two phantoms, a DECT methodology was tested as input for Geant4 MC proton dose calculations. Proton ranges were calculated for different mono-energetic proton beams irradiating both phantoms; the results were compared to the ground truth based on the phantom compositions. The same methodology was applied in a head-and-neck cancer patient using both SECT and dual-spiral DECT scans from the RT-specific scanner. A pencil-beam-scanning (PBS) plan was designed, which was subsequently optimized by MC dose calculations, and differences in proton range for the different image-based simulations were assessed. For phantoms, the DECT method yielded overall better material segmentation with &gt;86% of the voxel correctly assigned for the dual-spiral and dual-source scanners, but only 64% for a twin-beam scanner. For the calibration phantom, the dual-spiral scanner yielded range errors below 1.2 mm (0.6% of range), like the errors yielded by the dual-source scanner (&lt;1.1 mm, &lt;0.5%). With the validation phantom, the dual-spiral scanner yielded errors below 0.8 mm (0.9%), whereas SECT yielded errors up to 1.6 mm (2%). For the patient case, where the absolute truth was missing, proton range differences between DECT and SECT were on average in -1.2 ± 1.2 mm (-0.5 ± 0.5 %). MC dose calculations were successfully performed on DECT images, where the dual-spiral scanner resulted in media segmentation and range accuracy as good as the dual-source CT. In the patient, the various methods showed relevant range differences."
"Monoclonal gammopathies are common abnormalities and their incidence increases with age. They are detected in roughly 3 % of people older over 50 years and up to 7 % of those over 70 years. Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the proliferation of plasma cells within the bone marrow and excess secretion of monoclonal immunoglobulins. In Madagascar, late performance of biological examinations such as serum protein electrophoresis overestimates MM rates. We studied 54 patient records between March 2009 and January 2015 in the biology laboratory of the Joseph Ravoahangy Andrianavalona university hospital in Antananarivo (Madagascar). Monoclonal gammopathy was associated with multiple myeloma in most cases (88.9 %). Patients' median age was 64.2 years. Men were slightly more affected than women. It is discovered most frequently due to bone symptoms (83.3 %), and anemia is always present. Monoclonal gammopathy is mostly IgG. The bone marrow study showed medullary plasmacytosis. This disease appears most often in the elderly and has a slight male predominance. Bone marrow cytology is mandatory for diagnosis."
"Discoidin domain receptors 1 and 2 (DDR1 and DDR2) are members of the tyrosine kinase receptors activated after binding with collagen. DDRs are implicated in numerous physiological and pathological functions such as proliferation, adhesion and migration. Little is known about the expressions of the two receptors in normal and cancer cells and most of studies focus only on one receptor. Western blot analysis of DDR1 and DDR2 expression in different tumor cell lines shows an absence of high co-expression of the two receptors suggesting a deleterious effect of their presence at high amount. To study the consequences of high DDR1 and DDR2 co-expression in cells, we over-express the two receptors in HEK 293T cells and compare biological effects to HEK cells over-expressing DDR1 or DDR2. To distinguish between the intracellular dependent and independent activities of the two receptors we over-express an intracellular truncated dominant-negative DDR1 or DDR2 protein (DDR1DN and DDR2DN). No major differences of Erk or Jak2 activation are found after collagen I stimulation, nevertheless Erk activation is higher in cells co-expressing DDR1 and DDR2. DDR1 increases cell proliferation but co-expression of DDR1 and DDR2 is inhibitory. DDR1 but not DDR2 is implicated in cell adhesion to a collagen I matrix. DDR1 and DDR1 and DDR2 co-expression inhibit cell migration. Moreover a DDR1/DDR2 physical interaction is found by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Taken together, our results show a deleterious effect of high co-expression of DDR1 and DDR2 and a physical interaction between the two receptors."
"Academic self-concept is one's perception of his or her ability in an academic domain and is formed by comparing oneself to other students. As college biology classrooms transition from lecturing to active learning, students interact more with each other and are likely comparing themselves more to other students in the class. Student characteristics can impact students' academic self-concept; however, this has been unexplored in the context of undergraduate biology. In this study, we explored whether student characteristics can affect academic self-concept in the context of an active learning college physiology course. Using a survey, students self-reported how smart they perceived themselves to be in the context of physiology relative to the whole class and relative to their groupmate, the student with whom they worked most closely in class. Using linear regression, we found that men and native English speakers had significantly higher academic self-concept relative to the whole class compared with women and nonnative English speakers. Using logistic regression, we found that men had significantly higher academic self-concept relative to their groupmate compared with women. Using constant comparison methods, we identified nine factors that students reported influenced how they determined whether they were more or less smart than their groupmate. Finally, we found that students were more likely to report participating more than their groupmate if they had a higher academic self-concept. These findings suggest that student characteristics can influence students' academic self-concept, which in turn may influence their participation in small-group discussion and their academic achievement in active learning classes."
"Similar to human beings, pain is an unpleasant sensation experienced by animals as well. There is no exception when the animals are subjected to experimental procedures. Our duty as researchers/scientists is to prevent or minimize the pain in animals so as to lessen their suffering and distress during experimental procedures. The basics of the physiology of pain and pain perception, analgesia, anesthesia, and euthanasia of laboratory animals were included to complete the program, before the practical part was attempted and before advanced topics, such as comparison of anesthetic combinations, were discussed. Therefore, this course was organized in Sri Lanka for the first time in collaboration with the Comparative Biology Centre of Newcastle University, UK. During this course, we were able to demonstrate how an anesthesia machine could be used in laboratory animal anesthesia for the first time in the country. None of the animal houses in the country were equipped with an anesthesia machine at the time of conducting the course."
"Drugs do not act solely by canonical ligand-receptor binding interactions. Amphiphilic drugs partition into membranes thereby perturbing bulk lipid bilayer properties and possibly altering the function of membrane proteins. Distinguishing membrane perturbation from more direct protein-ligand interactions is an ongoing challenge in chemical biology. Herein, we present one strategy for doing so using dimeric 6-bromo-2-mercaptotryptamine (BrMT) and synthetic analogs. BrMT is a chemically unstable marine snail toxin that has unique effects on voltage-gated K+ channel proteins, making it an attractive medicinal chemistry lead. BrMT is amphiphilic and perturbs lipid bilayers, raising the question of whether its action against K+ channels is merely a manifestation of membrane perturbation. To determine whether medicinal chemistry approaches to improve BrMT might be viable, we synthesized BrMT and 11 analogs and determined their activities in parallel assays measuring K+ channel activity and lipid bilayer properties. Structure-activity relationships were determined for modulation of the Kv1.4 channel, bilayer partitioning, and bilayer perturbation. Neither membrane partitioning, nor bilayer perturbation, correlate with K+ channel modulation. We conclude that BrMT's membrane interactions are not critical for its inhibition of Kv1.4 activation. Further, we found that alkyl or ether linkages can replace the chemically labile disulfide bond in the BrMT pharmacophore, and we identified additional regions of the scaffold that are amenable to chemical modification. Our work demonstrates a strategy for determining if drugs act by specific interactions or bilayer-dependent mechanisms, and chemically stable modulators of Kv1 channels are reported."
"Here we present the realization of a novel fluorescence detection method based on the electromigration of fluorescent molecules within a nanocapillary combined with the laser excitation through a platinum (Pt)-coated nanocapillary. By using the Pt nanocapillary assisted focusing of a laser beam, we completely remove the background scattering on the tip of the electrophoretic nanocapillary. In this excitation geometry, we demonstrate a 1000-fold sensitivity enhancement (1.0 nM to 1.0 pM) compared to the detection in microcapillaries with epifluorescence illumination and fluorescence spectrophotometry. Due to a significant electroosmotic flow, we observe a decelerating migration of DNA molecules close to the tip of the electrophoretic nanocapillary. The reduced DNA translocation velocity causes a two-step stacking process of molecules in the tip of the nanocapillary and can be used as a way to locally concentrate molecules. The sensitivity of our method is further improved by a continuous electrokinetic injection of DNA molecules followed by sample zone stacking on the tip of the nanocapillary. Concentrations ranging from 0.1 pM to 1.0 fM can be directly observed on the orifice of the electrophoretic nanocapillary. This is a 1000-fold improvement compared to traditional capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence."
"Rice leaf color mutants play a great role in research about the formation and development of chloroplasts and the genetic mechanism of the chlorophyll (Chl) metabolism pathway. pgl3 is a rice leaf color mutant derived from Xiushui11 (Oryza sativa L. spp. japonica), treated with ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS). The mutant exhibited a pale-green leaf (pgl) phenotype throughout the whole development as well as reduced grain quality. Map-based cloning of PGL3 revealed that it encodes the chloroplast signal recognition particle 43 kDa protein (cpSRP43). PGL3 affected the Chl synthesis by regulating the expression levels of the Chl synthesis-associated genes. Considerable reactive oxygen species were accumulated in the leaves of pgl3, and the transcription levels of its scavenging genes were down-regulated, indicating that pgl3 can accelerate senescence. In addition, high temperatures could inhibit the plant's growth and facilitate the process of senescence in pgl3."
"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is 37-amino-acid neuropeptide, crucially involved in migraine pathophysiology. Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the CGRP pathway are currently under evaluation for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine: eptinezumab (ALD403), fremanezumab (TEV-48125), galcanezumab (LY2951742), and erenumab (AMG334). As reviewed in this article, all 4 antibodies have been proven effective, tolerable, and safe as migraine prophylactic treatments in phase II clinical trials. The mean decrease in migraine days per month was between 3.4 and 6.3 days/month after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment, and the placebo subtracted benefit ranged from 1 to 2.18 days. Notably, up to 32% of subjects experienced total migraine freedom after drug administration. Substance class-specific adverse events and treatment-related serious adverse event did not occur. Further long-term and large-scale trials are currently under way to verify the safety and efficacy profile of mAbs. In particular, the potential risk of vascular adverse events and the role of anti-drug antibodies deserve special attention. Anti-CGRP peptide and anti-CGRP receptor antibodies are the first effective treatments, which were specifically developed for the prevention of migraine. Their site of action in migraine prevention is most likely peripheral due to large molecule size, which prevents the penetration through the blood-brain barrier and thereby shows that peripheral components play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of a CNS disease."
"In this study, we introduce a novel compound-primed multiplex ARMS PCR (CPMAP) for simultaneous detection of common PAH gene mutations. This approach was used successfully for simultaneous identification of six most common PAH gene mutations in 137 phenylketonuria patients in the Iranian population. A total of six normal and six mutant allele-specific primers and 4 common primers containing a tag sequence of 12 base pair at the 5'-end were designed and used in two separate optimized multiplex ARMS reactions followed by hot-start PCR. The products were separated and visualized on 3% agarose gel. The CPMAP genotyping data were completely in accordance with the direct sequencing results. The CPMAP suggests a reliable, economical and rapid method for simultaneous detection of PAH point mutations using conventional PCR, which could be applied for diagnosis of other gene mutations."
"Thirteen SWEET transporters were identified in Camellia sinensis and the cold-suppression gene CsSWEET16 contributed to sugar compartmentation across the vacuole and function in modifying cold tolerance in Arabidopsis. The sugars will eventually be exported transporters (SWEET) family of sugar transporters in plants is a recently identified protein family of sugar uniporters that contain seven transmembrane helices harbouring two MtN3 motifs. SWEETs play important roles in various biological processes, including plant responses to environmental stimuli. In this study, 13 SWEET transporters were identified in Camellia sinensis and were divided into four clades. Transcript abundances of CsSWEET genes were detected in various tissues. CsSWEET1a/1b/2a/2b/2c/3/9b/16/17 were expressed in all of the selected tissues, whereas the expression of CsSWEET5/7/9a/15 was not detected in some tissues, including those of mature leaves. Expression analysis of nine CsSWEET genes in leaves in response to abiotic stresses, natural cold acclimation and Colletotrichum camelliae infection revealed that eight CsSWEET genes responded to abiotic stress, while CsSWEET3 responded to C. camelliae infection. Functional analysis of 13 CsSWEET activities in yeast revealed that CsSWEET1a/1b/7/17 exhibit transport activity for glucose analogues and other types of hexose molecules. Further characterization of the cold-suppression gene CsSWEET16 revealed that this gene is localized in the vacuolar membrane. CsSWEET16 contributed to sugar compartmentation across the vacuole and function in modifying cold tolerance in Arabidopsis. Together, these findings demonstrate that CsSWEET genes play important roles in the response to abiotic and biotic stresses in tea plants and provide insights into the characteristics of SWEET genes in tea plants, which could serve as the basis for further functional identification of such genes."
"Based on light and scanning electron microscopical studies, a new nematode parasite, Pseudodelphis eleginopsis n. sp. (Dracunculoidea: Guyanemidae), is described from tissues behind the gills of the Patagonian blennie Eleginops maclovinus (Cuvier) (Perciformes: Eleginopsidae) off the Atlantic coast (San Matías and San José Gulfs) of Patagonia, Argentina. The new species is mainly characterised by the length of the body (males 10-13 mm, larvigerous females 31-59 mm), the number (14) and arrangement of cephalic papillae, the absence of a buccal capsule, the muscular to glandular oesophagus length ratio (1:3-4) of larvigerous females, the length of the spicules (48-63 µm) and the number (7 pairs) and arrangement of the caudal papillae in the male. Pseudodelphis eleginopsis n. sp. is the first species of this genus described from a marine fish in the Atlantic Ocean and the first known dracunculoid parasitising the fish host belonging to the family Eleginopsidae. As revealed by the examination of very young females of the new species, the female genital tract of Pseudodelphis spp. is monodelphic. The genus Syngnathinema Moravec, Spangenberg & Frasca, 2001 is considered a junior synonym of Pseudodelphis Adamson & Roth, 1990 and, consequently, S. californiense and S. chitwoodi are transferred to Pseudodelphis as P. californiensis (Moravec, Spangenberg & Frasca, 2001) n. comb. and P. chitwoodi (Moravec & Kuchta, 2013) n. comb., respectively. Two dracunculoid species, Pseudodelphis limnicola Brugni & Viozzi, 2006 and the previously established Philonema percichthydis Moravec, Urawa & Coria, 1997, both described from the same freshwater host species, Percichthys trucha (Valenciennes), in the same region (Patagonia), are considered to be identical; therefore, the valid name of this species is Pseudodelphis percichthydis n. comb. and P. limnicola becomes its junior synonym. A key to the species of Pseudodelphis is provided."
"Little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing gonadal developmental processes in abalones. Here, we conducted transcriptome analysis of Pacific abalone Haliotis discus discus for gene discovery in the brain, ovary, testis, and unfertilized eggs. Among the annotated unigenes, 48.6% of unigenes were identified by Venn diagram analysis as having universal or tissue-specific expression. Twenty-three genes with gonad-biased gene ontology (GO) terms were first obtained. Secondly, 36 genes were found by screening known gene names related to germ cell development. Finally, 17 genes were obtained by querying the annotated unigene database for zygotically expressed gonadal genes (ovary and testis) and maternally expressed gonadal genes (ovary, testis, and unfertilized eggs) using keywords related to reproduction. To further verify tissue distribution pattern and subcellular localization of these genes, RT-PCR and in situ hybridization were performed using a unigene encoding a germ cell marker, vasa, as control. The results showed that vasa was expressed mainly in the early developmental stages of germ cells in both sexes. One of the candidate genes, vitelline envelope zona pellucida domain protein 12 (ZP12), was expressed in the primordial germ cells of immature gonad and early developmental stages of germ cells of the adult female. The results obtained from the present study suggest that vasa and ZP12 are involved in germ cell development of Pacific abalone and that ZP12 is an especially useful germ cell-specific marker in immature adults. The current gonadal transcriptome profile is an extensive resource for future reproductive molecular biology studies of this species."
"Ophiocordyceps sinensis is well known as a traditional Chinese medicine and has widely been used for over 2,000 years to stimulate immune system, decrease blood pressure and to inhibit tumor growth. While miRNAs are increasingly recognized for their roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in animals and plants, miRNAs in fungi were less studied until the discovery of microRNA-like RNA (milRNA). High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics approaches were used to identify conserved and novel milRNAs in O. sinensis. 40 conserved milRNAs were identified, while 23 pre-miRNA candidates encoding 31 novel milRNAs were predicted. Furthermore, the potential target genes of milRNAs in human were predicted and gene ontology analysis was applied to these genes. Enrichment analysis of GO-represented biological process showed that target genes of both conserved and novel milRNAs are involved in development, metabolic and immune processes, indicating the potential roles of milRNAs of O. sinensis in pharmacological effects as health food and traditional Chinese medicine. This study is the first report on genome-wide analysis of milRNAs in O. sinensis and it provides a useful resource to further study the potential roles of milRNAs as active components of O. sinensis in health food or traditional Chinese medicine."
"Georgy Gause (1910-1986) is best known for his contribution to ecology and evolutionary theory. His book ""The Struggle for Existence"" (1934) inspired generations of ecologists. Yet his scientific interests were diverse, embracing many aspects of the life sciences and medicine. The most notable shift in his research took place in the early 1940s when he began to study antibiotics and discovered Gramicidin S. Superficially, this shift looked like an attempt to switch from purely theoretical to applied research during the years of World War II, but Gause's decision may also have been seriously affected by the ""Great Purge"" and the growth of Lysenkoism. Personal factors played a significant role in his career too. In this article, we propose four factors which drove Gause to switch his focus from ecology to antibiotics: the inner logic of his scientific research, Stalin's science policy and the growth of Lysenkoism, the sociopolitical influence of World War II, and personal relationships. We will also show how all these factors are interdependent to some extent."
"Owls show an astonishing variation in their degree of colour polymorphism, although the exact mechanisms driving such variation remain controversial. Here we address this fundamental question by considering information on all extant owls and recent advances in comparative methods in the frame of three mutually non-exclusive evolutionary scenarios. In addition, we study for the first time whether the evolution of influential ecological characters facilitated the evolution of colour polymorphism (or vice versa). In agreement with the niche divergence hypothesis, we found that species living under more variable luminal conditions, i.e., species with diurnal and crepuscular habits and those inhabiting in a mixture of open and closed habitats, were more likely to show colour polymorphism. Correlated evolution analyses revealed that a change in the luminal niche might be a fundamental requisite for the evolution of colour polymorphism. Moreover, polymorphism was more frequent among owl species occupying lower trophic levels, which could be explained by a particularly high selection for crypsis on small predator owls. Our results, thus, provide support for the idea that colour polymorphism in owls is an adaptive character likely maintained by the selective advantage of morphs under different environmental conditions via disruptive selection mechanisms."
"Dengue has caused a significant public health impact globally. With the diverse genetic of the causative viruses, analysis of dengue virus (DENV) genomes is important to supplement epidemiological data with information that can be used to reconstruct the history of epidemics in time and space. We have reported the clinical and virological characteristics of dengue in Surabaya, Indonesia and revealed the presence of all four DENV serotypes and the predominance of DENV-1. The further classification of Surabaya DENV-1 into two different genotypes warrants in-depth genomic analysis to study the dynamics of both genotypes and their contribution to virus evolution, virus transmission, and disease. We performed full-length genome sequencing to nine isolates' representatives from DENV-1 Genotype I and Genotype IV. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses suggested the more recent introduction of Genotype I viruses compared to the more endemic Genotype IV. Comparative analysis of Surabaya DENV-1 genomes and other sequences available publicly revealed that the majority of the DENV-1 codons were under strong purifying selection, while seven codon sites identified to be under positive selection. We highlight a unique codon site under the positive pressure in the NS1 gene of DENV-1. Our results provide additional genomic data of DENV from Indonesia that may contribute to the better understanding of dengue disease dynamics."
"Cancer cell lines of human tissue origin have been extensively used to investigate antiproliferative activity and toxicity of herbal extracts, isolated compounds, and anticancer drugs. These cell lines are genetically and/or epigenetically well characterized to determine the altered expression of proteins within given cellular pathways and critical genes in cancer. Human derived hepatoma (HepG2) cell line has been extensively exploited to examine cytoprotective, antioxidative, hepatoprotective, anti-hepatoma, hypocholesterolemic, anti-steatosis, bioenergetic homeostatic and anti-insulin resistant properties. Moreover, mechanism of action of various botanicals and bioactive constituents has been reported using these cells. HepG2 cells have significant differences as compared to primary hepatocytes with respect to expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes and xenobiotic receptors in conventional in vitro culture conditions. Therefore, strategies have been employed to overcome limitations of two dimensional (2D) in vitro HepG2 cell culture in order to recognize functional biomarkers more accurately and to boost its predictive value in clinical research. In consequence, three dimensional (3D) human hepatoma cell culture models are being developed as a resource to achieve these goals of simulating the in vivo tumor microenvironment. It is assumed that bioengineered 3D hepatoma cell culture models can provide significant assistance in scrutinizing the molecular response of herbal natural products to recognize novel prognostic targets and crucial biomarkers in treatment strategies for cancer patients in near future."
"Termites evolved eusociality independently from social Hymenoptera. As a common trait, reproductive monopoly is maintained through chemical communication. The queen (and in termites also a king) prevents workers from reproduction by conveying their reproductive status. In termites all soldiers are sterile, but workers' potential to reproduce differs between species. It ranges from totipotency in wood-dwelling lower termites where workers are a transient stage from which all other castes develop, to sterile workers in some higher termites. Intermediate are species in which workers can develop into replacement sexuals within the nest but not into winged sexuals. I summarize the patchy picture about fertility signaling that we currently have for termites, pointing also to potential conflicts over reproduction that differ from those in social Hymenoptera. Recent findings imply that, similar to many social Hymenoptera, wood-dwelling termites that live in confined nests use long-chain cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) as fertility signals. Yet other compounds are important as well, comprising proteinaceous secretions and especially volatiles. For a subterranean termite, two volatiles have been identified as primer pheromones that prevent reproductive differentiation of workers. It requires more data to test whether wood-dwelling termites use CHCs, while species with larger colonies and less confined nests use volatiles, or whether all species rely on multicomponent signals. Ultimately, we need more effort to model and test potential conflicts over reproduction between queens, kings and workers. Here results from social Hymenoptera cannot be transferred to termites as the latter are diploid and commonly inbred. This review illustrates promising future research avenues."
"The goal of the study was to assess the potential of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2-targeting carbon-11 labeled (R)-N-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenyl)-6-methoxy-7-((1-methyl-3-piperidinyl)methoxy)-4-quinazolineamine ((R)-[11C]PAQ) as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging biomarker for evaluation of the efficacy of anticancer drugs in preclinical models.MMTV-PyMT mice were treated with vehicle alone (VEH), murine anti-VEGFA antibody (B20-4.1.1), and paclitaxel (PTX) in combination or as single agents. The treatment response was measured with (R)-[11C]PAQ PET as standardized uptake value (SUV)mean, SUVmaxrelative changes at the baseline (day 0) and follow-up (day 4) time points, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived PyMT mammary tumor volume (TV) changes. Expression of Ki67, VEGFR-2, and CD31 in tumor tissue was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Non-parametric statistical tests were used to evaluate the relation between (R)-[11C]PAQ radiotracer uptake and therapy response biomarkers.The (R)-[11C]PAQ SUVmaxin tumors was significantly reduced after 4 days in the B20-4.1.1/PTX combinational and B20-4.1.1 monotherapy groups (p?<?0.0005 and p?<?0.003, respectively). No significant change was observed in the PTX monotherapy group. There was a significant difference in the SUVmaxchange between the VEH group and B20-4.1.1/PTX combinational group, as well as between the VEH group and the B20-4.1.1 monotherapy group (p?<?0.05). MRI revealed significant decreases in TV in the B20-4.1.1/PTX treatment group (p?<?0.005) but not the other therapy groups. A positive trend was observed between the (R)-[11C]PAQ SUVmaxchange and TV reduction in the B20-4.1.1/PTX group. Statistical testing showed a significant difference in the blood vessel density between the B20-4.1.1/PTX combinational group and the VEH group (p?<?0.05) but no significant difference in the Ki67 positive signal between treatment groups.The results of this study are promising. However, additional studies are necessary before (R)-[11C]PAQ can be approved as a predictive radiotracer for cancer therapy response."
"Volvox carteri f. nagariensis is a model taxon that has been studied extensively at the cellular and molecular level. The most distinctive morphological attribute of V. carteri f. nagariensis within V. carteri is the production of sexual male spheroids with only a 1:1 ratio of somatic cells to sperm packets or androgonidia (sperm packet initials). However, the morphology of male spheroids of V. carteri f. nagariensis has been examined only in Japanese strains. In addition, V. carteri f. nagariensis has heterothallic sexuality; male and female sexes are determined by the sex-determining chromosomal region or mating-type locus composed of a >?1 Mbp linear chromosome. Fifteen sex-specific genes and many sex-based divergent shared genes (gametologs) are present within this region. Thus far, such genes have not been identified in natural populations of this species.During a recent fieldwork in Taiwan, we encountered natural populations of V. carteri that had not previously been recorded from Taiwan. In total, 33 strains of this species were established from water samples collected in Northern Taiwan. Based on sequences of the internal transcribed spacer 2 region of nuclear ribosomal DNA and the presence of asexual spheroids with up to 16 gonidia, the species was clearly identified as V. carteri f. nagariensis. However, the sexual male spheroids of the Taiwanese strains generally exhibited a 1:1 to >?50:1 ratio of somatic cells to androgonidia. We also investigated the presence or absence of several sex-specific genes and the sex-based divergent genes MAT3m, MAT3f and LEU1Sm. We did not identify recombination or deletion of such genes between the male and female mating-type locus haplotypes in 32 of the 33 strains. In one putative female strain, the female-specific gene HMG1f was not amplified by genomic polymerase chain reaction. When sexually induced, apparently normal female sexual spheroids developed in this strain.Male spheroids are actually variable within V. carteri f. nagariensis. Therefore, the minimum ratio of somatic cells to androgonidia in male spheroids and the maximum number of gonidia in asexual spheroids may be diagnostic for V. carteri f. nagariensis. HMG1f may not be directly related to the formation of female spheroids in this taxon."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, the aetiology of which is still largely unknown. Overwhelming evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central factor in PD pathophysiology. Here we review recent developments around mitochondrial dysfunction in familial and sporadic PD, with a brief overview of emerging therapies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction.Increasing evidence supports the critical role for mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of sporadic PD, while the involvement of familial PD-related genes in the regulation of mitochondrial biology has been expanded by the discovery of new mitochondria-associated disease loci and the identification of their novel functions. Recent research has expanded knowledge on the mechanistic details underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in PD, with the discovery of new therapeutic targets providing invaluable insights into the essential role of mitochondria in PD pathogenesis and unique opportunities for drug development."
"Plant symbiotic mutants are useful tool to uncover the molecular-genetic mechanisms of nodule senescence. The pea (Pisum sativum L.) mutants SGEFix--1 (sym40), SGEFix--3 (sym26), and SGEFix--7 (sym27) display an early nodule senescence phenotype, whereas the mutant SGEFix--2 (sym33) does not show premature degradation of symbiotic structures, but its nodules show an enhanced immune response. The nodules of these mutants were compared with each other and with those of the wild-type SGE line using seven marker genes that are known to be activated during nodule senescence. In wild-type SGE nodules, transcript levels of all of the senescence-associated genes were highest at 6 weeks after inoculation (WAI). The senescence-associated genes showed higher transcript abundance in mutant nodules than in wild-type nodules at 2 WAI and attained maximum levels in the mutant nodules at 4 WAI. Immunolocalization analyses showed that the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate accumulated earlier in the mutant nodules than in wild-type nodules. Together, these results showed that nodule senescence was activated in ineffective nodules blocked at different developmental stages in pea lines that harbor mutations in four symbiotic genes."
"Dietary nucleotides are thought to be conditionally essential nutrients in infancy. However, studies have reported inconsistent findings regarding the association between nucleotide supplementation and infant physical growth. We conducted this meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of nucleotide supplementation of infant formula in promoting early infant growth.Randomized controlled trials that evaluated the association between nucleotide supplementation and infant growth through June 2017 were included. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool. Standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed using Q and I2tests.Nucleotide supplementation significantly increased the rate of weight gain (SMD 0.26; 95% CI 0.06-0.47), but had no effect on weight (SMD - 0.16; 95% CI - 0.55-0.23), weight Z score (SMD, - 0.42; 95% CI - 1.64-0.81), length (SMD 0.01; 95% CI - 0.18-0.21) and length Z score (SMD 0.15; 95% CI - 0.10-0.40). Occipitofrontal head circumference (OFC) at 7-8 weeks (SMD 0.30; 95% CI 0.10-0.50) and the rate of OFC gain (SMD 0.34; 95% CI 0.09-0.58) were significantly improved with nucleotide supplementation, whereas, 16- and 20-week OFC values did not differ.Our meta-analysis indicated that nucleotide supplementation can increase the rate of weight gain, OFC and rate of OFC gain; however, we cannot conclude that it affects weight, weight Z score, length or length Z score. Large-scale randomized controlled trials of long-term nucleotide supplementation are needed to reach definitive conclusions."
"There is much information on the bioavailability of (poly)phenolic compounds following acute intake of various foods. However, there are only limited data on the effects of repeated and combined exposure to specific (poly)phenol food sources and the inter-individual variability in their bioavailability. This study evaluated the combined urinary excretion of (poly)phenols from green tea and coffee following daily consumption by healthy subjects in free-living conditions. The inter-individual variability in the production of phenolic metabolites was also investigated.Eleven participants consumed both tablets of green tea and green coffee bean extracts daily for 8 weeks and 24-h urine was collected on five different occasions. The urinary profile of phenolic metabolites and a set of multivariate statistical tests were used to investigate the putative existence of characteristic metabotypes in the production of flavan-3-ol microbial metabolites.(Poly)phenolic compounds in the green tea and green coffee bean extracts were absorbed and excreted after simultaneous consumption, with green tea resulting in more inter-individual variability in urinary excretion of phenolic metabolites. Three metabotypes in the production of flavan-3-ol microbial metabolites were tentatively defined, characterized by the excretion of different amounts of trihydroxyphenyl-?-valerolactones, dihydroxyphenyl-?-valerolactones, and hydroxyphenylpropionic acids.The selective production of microbiota-derived metabolites from flavan-3-ols and the putative existence of characteristic metabotypes in their production represent an important development in the study of the bioavailability of plant bioactives. These observations will contribute to better understand the health effects and individual differences associated with consumption of flavan-3-ols, arguably the main class of flavonoids in the human diet."
"Nickel (Ni(II)) toxicity is addressed by many different bacteria, but bacterial responses to nickel stress are still unclear. Therefore, we studied the effect of Ni(II) toxicity on cell proliferation of ?-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Next, we showed the mechanism that allows C. crescentus to survive in Ni(II) stress condition. Our results revealed that the growth of C. crescentus is severely affected when the bacterium was exposed to different Ni(II) concentrations, 0.003 mM slightly affected the growth, 0.008 mM reduced the growth by 50%, and growth was completely inhibited at 0.015 mM. It was further shown that Ni(II) toxicity induced mislocalization of major regulatory proteins such as MipZ, FtsZ, ParB, and MreB, resulting in dysregulation of the cell cycle. GC-MS metabolomics analysis of Ni(II) stressed C. crescentus showed an increased level of nine important metabolites including TCA cycle intermediates and amino acids. This indicates that changes in central carbon metabolism and nitrogen metabolism are linked with the disruption of cell division process. Addition of malic acid, citric acid, alanine, proline, and glutamine to 0.015 mM Ni(II)-treated C. crescentus restored its growth. Thus, the present work shows a protective effect of these organic acids and amino acids on Ni(II) toxicity. Metabolic stimulation through the PutA/GlnA pathway, accelerated degradation of CtrA, and Ni-chelation by organic acids or amino acids are some of the possible mechanisms suggested to be involved in enhancing C. crescentus's tolerance. Our results shed light on the mechanism of increased Ni(II) tolerance in C. crescentus which may be useful in bioremediation strategies and synthetic biology applications such as the development of whole cell biosensor."
"The term 'neurogenic inflammation' is commonly used, especially with respect to the role of sensory nerves within inflammatory disease. However, despite over a century of research, we remain unclear about the role of these nerves in the vascular biology of inflammation, as compared with their interacting role in pain processing and of their potential for therapeutic manipulation. This chapter attempts to discuss the progress in understanding, from the initial discovery of sensory nerves until the present day. This covers pioneering findings that these nerves exist, are involved in vascular events and act as important sensors of environmental changes, including injury and infection. This is followed by discovery of the contents they release such as the established vasoactive neuropeptides substance P and CGRP as well as anti-inflammatory peptides such as the opioids and somatostatin. The more recent emergence of the importance of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels has revealed some of the mechanisms by which these nerves sense environmental stimuli. This knowledge enables a platform from which to learn of the potential role of neurogenic inflammation in disease and in turn of novel therapeutic targets."
"Innate immune cells are recognized for their rapid and critical contribution to the body's first line of defense against invading pathogens and harmful agents. These actions can be further amplified by specific adaptive immune responses adapted to the activating stimulus. Recently, the awareness has grown that virtually all innate immune cells, i.e., mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, basophils, and NK cells, are able to communicate with dendritic cells (DCs) and/or T and B cells, and thereby significantly contribute to the orchestration of adaptive immune responses. The means of communication that are thus far primarily associated with this function are cell-cell contacts and the release of a broad range of soluble mediators. Moreover, the possible contribution of innate immune cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) to the modulation of adaptive immunity will be outlined in this review. EVs are submicron particles composed of a lipid bilayer, proteins, and nucleic acids released by cells in a regulated fashion. EVs are involved in intercellular communication between multiple cell types, including those of the immune system. A good understanding of the mechanisms by which innate immune cell-derived EVs influence adaptive immune responses, or vice versa, may reveal novel insights in the regulation of the immune system and can open up new possibilities for EVs (or their components) in controlling immune responses, either as a therapy, target, or as an adjuvant in future immune modulating treatments."
"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound vesicles released into the extracellular space by almost all types of cells. EVs can cross the physiological barriers, and a variety of biological fluids are enriched in them. EVs are a heterogeneous population of vesicles, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. The different subpopulations of vesicles can be differentiated by size and origin, in which exosomes (~100 nm and from endocytic origin) are the most studied so far. EVs have essential roles in cell-to-cell communication and are critical modulators of immune response under normal and pathological conditions. Pregnancy is a unique situation of immune-modulation in which the maternal immune system protects the fetus from allogenic rejection and maintains the immunosurveillance. The placenta is a vital organ that performs a multitude of functions to support the pregnancy. The EVs derived from the human placenta have crucial roles in regulating the maternal immune response for successful pregnancy outcome. Placenta-derived vesicles perform a myriad of functions like suppression of immune reaction to the developing fetus and establishment and maintenance of a systemic inflammatory response to combat infectious intruders. A fine-tuning of these mechanisms is quintessential for successful completion of pregnancy and healthy outcome for mother and fetus. Dysregulation in the mechanisms mentioned above can lead to several pregnancy disorders. In this review, we summarize the current literature regarding the critical roles played by the EVs in immunomodulation during pregnancy with particular attention to the placenta-derived exosomes."
"Serratia marcescens is a gram-negative, facultatively-anaerobic bacterium and opportunistic pathogen which produces the red pigment prodigiosin. We employed both batch culture and chemostat growth methods to investigate prodigiosin function in the producing organism. Pigmentation correlated with an increased rate of ATP production during population lag phase. Results with a lacZ transcriptional fusion to the prodigiosin (pig) biosynthetic operon revealed that operon transcription is activated by low cellular levels of ATP at high cell density. Furthermore, these data enabled estimation of the ATP per cell minimum value at which the operon is induced. Pigmented cells were found to accumulate ATP more rapidly and to multiply more quickly than non-pigmented cells during the high density growth phase. Finally, results with both batch and chemostat culture revealed that pigmented cells grow to approximately twice the biomass yield as non-pigmented S. marcescens bacteria. Prodigiosin production may, therefore, provide a growth advantage at ambient temperatures."
"At the time of their clinical manifestation, the heterogeneous group of adult and pediatric gliomas carries a wide range of diverse somatic genomic alterations, ranging from somatic single-nucleotide variants to structural chromosomal rearrangements. Somatic abnormalities may have functional consequences, such as a decrease, increase or change in mRNA transcripts, and cells pay a penalty for maintaining them. These abnormalities, therefore, must provide cells with a competitive advantage to become engrained into the glioma genome. Here, we propose a model of gliomagenesis consisting of the following five consecutive phases that glioma cells have traversed prior to clinical manifestation: (I) initial growth; (II) oncogene-induced senescence; (III) stressed growth; (IV) replicative senescence/crisis; (V) immortal growth. We have integrated the findings from a large number of studies in biology and (neuro)oncology and relate somatic alterations and other results discussed in these papers to each of these five phases. Understanding the story that each glioma tells at presentation may ultimately facilitate the design of novel, more effective therapeutic approaches."
"Organo-lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for high-performance photodetectors. However, the toxicity of lead cations in these materials limits their further applications. Here, a flexible photoconductor is developed based on lead-free two-dimensional (2D) perovskite (PEA)2SnI4 via a one-step solution processing method. The flexible transparent electrodes are patterned from rGO/(PEDOT:PSS) hybrid films. The stability and reproducibility of the devices are significantly improved on adding 30 mol% SnF2 to the perovskite. The flexible photoconductors show a photoresponsivity of 16 A W-1 and a detectivity of 1.92 × 1011 Jones under 470 nm illumination, which are higher than those of most of the similar devices. Besides, the devices possess much better mechanical flexibility and durability than the flexible devices with an Au electrode. Finally, this flexible photoconductor is applied as a light-stimulated synaptic device and can mimic the short-term plasticity of biological synapses. This is the first study to report that lead-free 2D perovskite can be used in flexible photoconductors and synaptic devices."
"The main element of PbRS (passive (bio)remediation systems) are sorbents, which act as natural filters retaining heavy metals and carriers of microorganisms involved in water treatment. Thus, the effectiveness of PbRS is determined by the quality of the (ad)sorbents, which should be stable under various environmental conditions, have a wide range of applications and be non-toxic to (micro)organisms used in these systems. Our previous studies showed that bog iron ores (BIOs) meet these requirements. However, further investigation of the physical and chemical parameters of BIOs under environmental conditions is required before their large-scale application in PbRS. The aim of this study was (i) to investigate the ability of granulated BIOs (gBIOs) to remove arsenic from various types of contaminated waters, and (ii) to estimate the application potential of gBIOs in technologies dedicated to water treatment. These studies were conducted on synthetic solutions of arsenic and environmental samples of arsenic contaminated water using a set of adsorption columns filled with gBIOs. The experiments performed in a static system revealed that gBIOs are appropriate arsenic and zinc adsorbent. Dynamic adsorption studies confirmed these results and showed, that the actual sorption efficiency of gBIOs depends on the adsorbate concentration and is directly proportional to them. Desorption analysis showed that As-loaded gBIOs are characterized by high chemical stability and they may be reused for the (ad)sorption of other elements, i.e., zinc. It was also shown that gBIOs may be used for remediation of both highly oxygenated waters and groundwater or settling ponds, where the oxygen level is low, as both forms of inorganic arsenic (arsenate and arsenite) were effectively removed. Arsenic concentration after treatment was <100 ?g/L, which is below the limit for industrial water."
"Murine models ofSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium infection are one of the commonest tools to study host-pathogen interactions during bacterial infections. Critically, the outcome ofS. Typhimurium infection is impacted by the genetic background of the mouse strain used, with macrophages from C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice lacking the capacity to control intracellular bacterial replication. For this reason, the use of congenic strains, which mix the genetic backgrounds of naturally protected mouse strains with those of susceptible strains, has the capacity to significantly alter results and interpretation ofS. Typhimurium infection studies. Here, we describe how macrophage knockout cell lines generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing can help determine the contribution of background contaminations in the phenotypes of primary macrophages from congenic mice, on the outcome ofS. Typhimurium infection studies. Our own experience illustrates how the CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be used to complement pre-existing knockout models, and shows that there is great merit in performing concurrent studies with both genetic models, to exclude unanticipated side-effects on host-pathogen interactions."
"Type III secretion systems harbored by several Gram-negative bacteria are often used to deliver host-modulating effectors into infected eukaryotic cells. About 20 core proteins are needed for assembly of a secretion apparatus. Several of these proteins are genetically and functionally conserved in type III secretion systems of bacteria associated with invertebrate or vertebrate hosts. In the Ysc family of type III secretion systems are two poorly characterized protein families, the YscX family and the YscY family. In the plasmid-encoded Ysc-Yop type III secretion system of human pathogenicYersiniaspecies, YscX is a secreted substrate while YscY is its non-secreted cognate chaperone. Critically, neither anyscXnoryscYnull mutant ofYersiniais capable of type III secretion. In this study, we show that the genetic equivalents of these proteins produced as components of other type III secretion systems ofPseudomonas aeruginosa(PscX and PscY),Aeromonasspecies (AscX and AscY),Vibriospecies (VscX and VscY), andPhotorhabdus luminescens(SctX and SctY) all possess an ability to interact with its native cognate partner and also establish cross-reciprocal binding to non-cognate partners as judged by a yeast two-hybrid assay. Moreover, a yeast three-hybrid assay also revealed that these heterodimeric complexes could maintain an interaction with YscV family members, a core membrane component of all type III secretion systems. Despite maintaining these molecular interactions, only expression of the nativeyscXin the near full-lengthyscXdeletion and nativeyscYin the near full-lengthyscYdeletion were able to complement for their general substrate secretion defects. Hence, YscX and YscY must have co-evolved to confer an important function specifically critical forYersiniatype III secretion."
"Recurrent Vulvovaginal infections (RVVI) are the commonly reported microbiological syndrome affecting millions of women globally. Various molecules of innate immune system are instrumental in clearance of these microbial pathogens, thus suggested as one of the most important contributing factor in determining the disease outcome. Dendritic cell-associated C-type lectin-1 (Dectin-1) is an important molecule of innate immunity that is primarily known for its role in antifungal defenses. However, role of dectin-1 in recognition of other pathogens is also documented. The intracellular expression of dectin-1 was shown to be up-regulated by Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL)-mediated opsonophagocytosis of pathogens. Dectin-1 is encoded byCLEC7A, postulated to be a candidate gene in modulating risk of developing RVVI. In this study, we identifiedCLEC7Acausal variants usingin silicoanalysis. To assess their impact on susceptibility to RVVI, these causal variants along with serum dectin-1 levels (sDectin-1) were investigated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and Enzyme Linked Immnosorbent Assay (ELISA) respectively, under a case-control design. Furthermore, effect of these polymorphisms was also assessed on sMBL levels.In silicoanalysis revealed 9 putative functional conserved SNPs ofCLEC7A. Association analysis revealed a significantly lower risk of developing RVVI and its types in carriers ofCLEC7Ars3901533 G allele and its homozygous genotypes (p< 0.05). The heterozygous genotype was associated with significant protection against RVVI (p= 0.004). Haplotypes GGG and GTA showed significant protection against RVVI (p< 0.0001;p= 0.0003), Bacterial Vaginosis (p= 0.03;p= 0.002), Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (p= 0.03;p= 0.01) and Mixed Infections (p= 0.007;p= 0.04). Mean sDectin-1 levels were significantly high in RVVI and its types compared to controls (p< 0.05). Further, genotype-phenotype stratification showed significant differences within/between cases groups and controls. TheCLEC7Ars3901533 polymorphism was also found to be associated with sMBL levels. The present study contributed novel insights into the role of dectin-1 in RVVI.CLEC7Ars3901533 polymorphism and high sDectin-1 levels along with low sMBL levels were found to be associated with RVVI susceptibility. Thus, screening of women with RVVI for these novel associations may lead to better diagnosis and treatment. Also genotyping method used in this study constitutes a simple and reliable assay, which can be confidently, used as a cheaper alternative for genotyping these variants in clinical settings. Finally, new restorative markers for other infectious diseases might be found by exploring nine functionally identifiedCLEC7ASNPs."
"Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) plays a central role in the DNA damage response (DDR) and mutations in its gene lead to the development of a rare autosomic genetic disorder, ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) characterized by neurodegeneration, premature aging, defects in the immune response, and higher incidence of lymphoma development. The ability of ATM to control genome stability several pointed to ATM as tumor suppressor gene. Growing evidence clearly support a significant role of ATM, in addition to its master ability to control the DDR, as principle modulator of oxidative stress response and mitochondrial homeostasis, as well as in the regulation of autophagy, hypoxia, and cancer stem cell survival. Consistently, A-T is strongly characterized by aberrant oxidative stress, significant inability to remove damaged organelles such as mitochondria. These findings raise the question whether ATM may contribute to a more general hijack of signaling networks in cancer, therefore, playing a dual role in this context. Indeed, an unexpected tumorigenic role for ATM, in particular, tumor contexts has been demonstrated. Genetic inactivation of Beclin-1, an autophagy regulator, significantly reverses mitochondrial abnormalities and tumor development in ATM-null mice, independently of DDR. Furthermore, ATM sustains cancer stem cells survival by promoting the autophagic flux and ATM kinase activity is enhanced in HER2-dependent tumors. This mini-review aims to shed new light on the complexity of these new molecular circuits through which ATM may modulate cancer progression and to highlight a novel role of ATM in the control of proteostasis."
"Advancements in the early detection of cancer coupled with improved surgery, radiotherapy, and adjuvant therapy led to substantial increase in patient survival. Nevertheless, cancer metastasis is the leading cause of death in several cancer patients. The majority of these deaths are associated with metastatic relapse kinetics after a variable period of clinical remission. Most of the cancer recurrences are thought to be associated with the reactivation of dormant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). In this review, we have summarized the cellular and molecular mechanisms related to DTCs and the role of microenvironmental niche. These mechanisms regulate the dormant state and help in the reactivation, which leads to metastatic outgrowth. Identification of novel therapeutic targets to eliminate these dormant tumor cells will be highly useful in controlling the metastatic relapse-related death with several cancers."
"Aberrant activation of NF-?B is linked with the progression of human malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and blockade of NF-?B signaling could be a potential target in the treatment of several cancers. Therefore, designing of novel small molecule inhibitors that target NF-?B activation is of prime importance in the treatment of several cancers. In the present work, we report the synthesis of series of 1,3,4-oxadiazoles, investigated their anticancer potential against HCC cells, and identified 2-(3-chlorobenzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)-5-(3-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (CMO) as the lead compound. Further, we examined the effect of CMO on cell cycle distribution (flow cytometry), apoptosis (annexin V-propidium iodide-FITC staining), and phosphorylation of NF-?B signaling pathway proteins (I?B and p65) in HCC cells. We found that CMO induced antiproliferative effect in dose- and time-dependent manner. Also, CMO significantly increased the percentage of sub-G1 cell population and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, CMO found to decrease the phosphorylation of I?B (Ser 32) in the cytoplasmic extract and p65 (Ser 536) in the nuclear extract of HCC cells. It also abrogated the DNA binding ability and transcriptional activity of NF-?B. CMO induced the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 in a time-dependent manner. In addition, transfection with p65 small interfering RNA blocks CMO-induced caspase-3/7 activation. Molecular docking analysis revealed that CMO interacts with the hydrophobic region of p65 protein. Thus, we are reporting CMO as an inhibitor of NF-?B signaling pathway."
"The chemopreventive activity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), particularly aspirin, has been well demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies. However, the primary side effect from this class of drug is gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, which has limited the widespread use of NSAIDs for the prevention of cancer. The development of GI-safer NSAIDs, which are associated with phosphatidylcholine (PC) may provide a solution to this therapeutic problem. In the present study, the efficacy of two NSAIDs, aspirin and indomethacin, were compared using murine colon cancer cell line MC-26. Each NSAID was assessed alone and in combination with PC, usingin vitroandin vivosystems. The results reveal that the PC-associated NSAIDs had a significantly higher degree of protection against cancer cell growth compared with the unmodified NSAIDs. It was also observed that Aspirin-PC and Indomethacin-PC prevented the metastatic spread of cancer cells in a syngeneic mouse model. These results support the potential use of PC-NSAIDs for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer."
"The objective of the present study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of sodium citrate on human gastric adenocarcinoma epithelia AGS cells. Numerous cytotoxicity-associated sodium citrate-induced effects were assessed, including cell viability and proliferation, cytokine expression and caspase activity.In vitrostudies demonstrated that incubation with sodium citrate (>3.125 mM) inhibited AGS cell viability and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation with sodium citrate for 24 h revealed that the levels of interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor increased with an increasing of dose of sodium citrate, whereas the IL-6 levels exhibited only a slight alteration. In addition, increases in caspase-3 and -9 activities were associated with increased duration of treatment and dosage of sodium citrate. Collectively, the results of the present study demonstrated that treatment with sodium citrate at higher concentrations or for longer durations exerts a cytotoxic effect on AGS cells via the induction of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and the alteration in the levels of certain cytokines."
"Blocking the activation of nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B) is a promising strategy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. The circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a key component of the sporozoite stage of the malaria parasite, was previously reported to block NF-?B activation in hepatocytes. Therefore, in the present study, the effect of CSP on the growth of the human lung cancer cell line, A549, was investigated. It was demonstrated that transfection with a recombinant plasmid expressing CSP was able to inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner and induce the apoptosis of A549 cells. A NF-?B gene reporter assay indicated that CSP and its nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif were able to equally suppress the activation of NF-?B following stimulation with human recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-? in A549 cells. Furthermore, western blot analysis indicated that NLS did not affect the phosphorylation and degradation of I?B, but was able to markedly inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-?B in TNF-? stimulated A549 cells. Therefore, the data suggest that CSP may be investigated as a potential novel NF-?B inhibitor for the treatment of lung cancer."
"This present study investigated the impact of the application of stem cells to liver regeneration following the first stage of associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS). The experiment was conducted on a pig model (n=6, 3 that did not receive application of stem cells, 3 that received application stem cells). Collected samples of liver (day 0 and 9 following surgery) were subjected to complete transcriptome sequencing. In total, 39 differentially expressed genes were found in the group without the application of the stem cells (genes of unwanted processes such as fibrosis and inflammation). In the group that did receive application of stem cells, no significantly differentially expressed genes were found, indicating a properly regenerated liver remnant. The present study therefore demonstrated, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the positive effect of stem cells application in the liver regeneration process during ALPPS procedure in the pig model."
"Reliable animal models are required for thein vivostudy of the molecular mechanisms and effects of chemotherapeutic drugs in hepatocarcinoma.In vivotracing techniques based on firefly luciferase (FLuc) may optimize the non-invasive monitoring of experimental animals. The present study established a murine Hepa1-6-FLuc cell line that stably expressed a retrovirus-delivered FLuc protein gene. The cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion ability of Hepa1-6-FLuc cells were the same as that of the Hepa1-6 cells, and thus is suitable to replace Hepa1-6 cells in the construction of hepatocarcinoma animal models. No differences in subcutaneous tumor mass and its pathomorphology from implanted Hepa1-6-FLuc cells were observed compared with Hepa1-6 control tumors. Bioluminescence imaging indicated that the Luc signal of the Hepa1-6-FLuc cells was consistently strengthened with increases in tumor mass; however, the Luc signal of Hepa1-6-AdFLuc became weaker and eventually disappeared during tumor development. Therefore, compared with the transient expression by adenovirus, stable expression of the FLuc gene in Hepa1-6 cells may better reflect cell proliferation and survivalin vivo, and provide a reliable source for the establishment of hepatocarcinoma models."
"Smoking frequently leads to epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation and histone modifications. The effect that smoking has on the DNA methylation levels at CCGG sites, the expression of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and their interactions in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were analyzed. There were a total of 42 patients with NSCLC, 22 with adenocarcinomas and 20 with squamous cell carcinomas enrolled in the present study. Expression of H3K27me3, EZH2 and proliferating cellular nuclear antigen (PCNA) were immunohistochemically detected. DNA methylation at CCGG sites was evaluated via histoendonuclease-linked detection of DNA methylation sites. The apoptotic index of cancerous tissues obtained from patients of different smoking statuses was evaluated via the terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling method. The association with clinicopathological data was calculated relative to different smoking statuses. Compared with the non-smokers, smokers with NSCLC exhibited a significantly lower apoptotic index (P<0.05), and frequently had a lower level of DNA methylation at CCGG sites, lower H3K27me3 expression and a higher EZH2 expression (P<0.05). DNA methylation levels at CCGG sites were negatively correlated to the Brinkman index (P=0.017). Furthermore, there was a parallel association between the H3K27me3 and EZH2 expression levels in the majority of smokers, whereas in the majority of non-smokers, there was a diverging association (P=0.015). There was a diverging association between the PCNA and EZH2 expression levels in the majority of smokers; however, in the majority of non-smokers, there was a parallel association (P=0.048). In addition, the association between the CCGG methylation ratio and immunohistochemical expression of H3K27me3 was a parallel association in the majority of smokers, while in the majority of non-smokers there was a diverging association (P=0.049). Conclusively, patients with NSCLC and different smoking statuses exhibit different epigenetic characteristics. Additionally, DNA methylation levels at the CCGG sites may have the ability to determine associations between the expression levels of H3K27me3, EZH2 and PCNA."
"HuT-102 cells are considered one of the most representable human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1)-infected cell lines for studying adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL). In our previous studies, genome-wide screening was performed using the GeneChip system with Human Genome Array U133 Plus 2.0 for transforming growth factor-?-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-, interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)- and IRF4-regulated genes to demonstrate the effects of interferon-inducible genes in HuT-102 cells. Our previous findings demonstrated that TAK1 induced interferon inducible genes via an IRF3-dependent pathway and that IRF4 has a counteracting effect. As our previous data was performed by manual selection of common interferon-related genes mentioned in the literature, there has been some obscure genes that have not been considered. In an attempt to maximize the outcome of those microarrays, the present study reanalyzed the data collected in previous studies through a set of computational rules implemented using 'R' software, to identify important candidate genes that have been missed in the previous two studies. The final list obtained consisted of ten genes that are highly recommend as potential candidate for therapies targeting the HTLV-1 infected cancer cells. Those genes are ATM, CFTR, MUC4, PARP14, QK1, UBR2, CLEC7A (Dectin-1), L3MBTL, SEC24D and TMEM140. Notably, PARP14 has gained increased attention as a promising target in cancer cells."
"HCV entry involves a complex interplay between viral and host molecules. During post-binding interactions, the viral E2 complexes with CD81 receptor for delivery to the tight junction proteins CLDN1 and OCLN, which aid in viral internalization. Targeting HCV entry receptors represents an appealing approach to inhibit viral infectivity. This study aimed at investigating the impact of targeting CLDN1 by microRNAs on HCV infectivity. miR-155 was previously shown to target the 3'UTR of CLDN1 mRNA. Therefore, miR-155 was used as a control in this study.In-silicoanalysis and luciferase reporter assay were utilized to identify potential targeting miRNAs. The impact of the identified miRNAs on CLDN1 mRNA and protein expression was examined by qRT-PCR, indirect immunofluorescence and western blotting, respectively. The role of the selected miRNAs on HCV infectivity was assessed by measuring the viral load following the ectopic expression of the selected miRNAs. miR-182 was identifiedin-silicoand by experimental validation to target CLDN1. Both miR-155 and miR-182 inhibited CLDN1 mRNA and protein expression in infected Huh7 cells. Ectopic expression of miR-155 increased, while miR-182 reduced the viral load. In conclusion, despite repressing CLDN1, the impact of miR-155 and miR-182 on HCV infectivity is contradictory. Ectopic miR-182 expression is suggested as an upstream regulator of the entry factor CLDN1, harnessing HCV infection."
"Chromosome changes can perform an important role in speciation by acting as post-zygotic reproductive barriers. The Neotropical electric fish genusBrachyhypopomus(Gymnotiformes, Hypopomidae) has 28 described species, but cytogenetic data are hitherto available only for four of them. To understand karyotype evolution and investigate the possible role of chromosome changes in the diversification of this genus, we describe here the karyotype of eight species ofBrachyhypopomusfrom a sympatric assemblage in the central Amazon basin. We analyzed cytogenetic data in the context of a phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus and known patterns of geographical distribution. We found a strong phylogenetic signal for chromosome number and noted that sympatric species have exclusive karyotypes. Additional insights into the role of chromosome changes in the diversification ofBrachyhypopomusare discussed."
"Many vegetable and oilseed crops belong toBrassicaspecies. The seed production of these crops is hampered often by abnormal floral organs, especially under the conditions of abiotic conditions. However, the molecular reasons for these abnormal floral organs remains poorly understood. Here, we report a novel pistil-like flower mutant ofB. rapa. In the flower of this mutant, the four sepals are modified to one merged carpel that look like a ring in the sepal positions, enveloping some abnormal stamens and a pistil, and resulting in poor seed production. This novel mutant is namedsepal-carpel modification(scm). DNA sequencing showed that theBrAP2agene, the ortholog ofArabidopsis APETALA2(AP2) that specifies sepal identity, losses the function of inscmmutant due to a 119-bp repeated sequence insertion that resulted in an early transcription termination.BrAP2b, the paralog ofBrAP2afeatured two single-nucleotide substitutions that cause a single amino acid substitution in the highly conserved acidic serine-rich transcriptional activation domain. Each of the twoBrAP2genes rescues the sepal defective phenotype of theap2-5mutant ofArabidopsis. Furthermore, the knockout mutation of the correspondingBnAP2genes of oilseed rape (B. napus) by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system resulted inscm-like phenotype. These results suggest thatBrAP2gene plays a key role in sepal modification. Our finding provides an insight into molecular mechanism underlying morphological modification of floral organs and is useful for genetic manipulation of flower modification and improvement of seed production ofBrassicacrops."
"As an important relative of wheat (Triticum aestivumL),Dasypyrum breviaristatumcontains novel high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) encoded byGlu-1Vbgenes. We identified new wheat-D. breviaristatumchromosome introgression lines including chromosomes 1Vband 1VbL.5VbL by fluorescencein situhybridization (FISH) combined with molecular markers. We found that chromosome changes occurred in the wheat-D. breviaristatumintrogression lines and particularly induced the deletion of 5BS terminal repeats and formation of a new type of 5B-7B reciprocal translocation. The results imply that theD. breviaristatumchromosome 1Vbmay contain genes which induce chromosomal recombination in wheat background. Ten putative high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) genes fromD. breviaristatumand wheat-D. breviaristatumintrogression lines were isolated. The lengths of the HMW-GS genes inDasypyrumwere significantly shorter than typical HMW-GS of common wheat. A new y-type HMW-GS gene, namedGlu-Vb1y, was characterized in wheat-D. breviaristatum1Vbintrogression lines. The new wheat-D. breviaristatumgermplasm displayed reduced plant height, increased tillers and superior grain protein and gluten contents, improved gluten performance index. The results showed considerable potential for utilization ofD. breviaristatumchromosome 1Vbsegments in future wheat improvement."
"Recent times have seen an enormous growth of ""omics"" data, of which high-throughput gene expression data are arguably the most important from a functional perspective. Despite huge improvements in computational techniques for the functional classification of gene sequences, common similarity-based methods often fall short of providing full and reliable functional information. Recently, the combination of comparative genomics with approaches in functional genomics has received considerable interest for gene function analysis, leveraging both gene expression based guilt-by-association methods and annotation efforts in closely related model organisms. Besides the identification of missing genes in pathways, these methods also typically enable the discovery of biological regulators (i.e., transcription factors or signaling genes). A previously built guilt-by-association method is MORPH, which was proven to be an efficient algorithm that performs particularly well in identifying and prioritizing missing genes in plant metabolic pathways. Here, we present MorphDB, a resource where MORPH-based candidate genes for large-scale functional annotations (Gene Ontology, MapMan bins) are integrated across multiple plant species. Besides a gene centric query utility, we present a comparative network approach that enables researchers to efficiently browse MORPH predictions across functional gene sets and species, facilitating efficient gene discovery and candidate gene prioritization. MorphDB is available at http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/morphdb/morphDB/index/. We also provide a toolkit, named ""MORPH bulk"" (https://github.com/arzwa/morph-bulk), for running MORPH in bulk mode on novel data sets, enabling researchers to apply MORPH to their own species of interest."
"Iron deficiency in plants is caused by a low availability of iron in the soil, and its main visual symptom is leaf yellowing due to a decrease in chlorophyll content, along with a reduction in plant growth and fruit quality. Foliar sprays with Fe compounds are an economic alternative to the treatment with expensive synthetic Fe-chelates applied to the soil, although the efficacy of foliar treatments is rather limited. Generally, plant response to Fe-foliar treatments is monitored by measuring chlorophyll content (or related parameters as SPAD index). However, different studies have shown that foliar Fe sprays cause a local regreening and that translocation of the applied Fe within the plant is quite low. In this context, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of foliar applications of different Fe compounds [FeSO4, Fe(III)-EDTA, and Fe(III)-heptagluconate] on Fe-deficient cucumber plants, by studying the main physiological plant root responses to Fe deficiency [root Fe(III) chelate reductase (FCR) activity; acidification of the nutrient solution; and expression of the Fe deficiency responsive genes encoding FCR,CsFRO1, Fe(II) root transporterCsIRT1, and two plasma membrane H+-ATPases,CsHA1andCsHA2], along with SPAD index, plant growth and Fe content. The results showed that the overall assessment of Fe-deficiency root responses improved the evaluation of the efficacy of the Fe-foliar treatments compared to just monitoring SPAD indexes. Thus, FCR activity and expression of Fe-deficiency response genes, especiallyCsFRO1andCsHA1, preceded the trend of SPAD index and acted as indicators of whether the plant was sensing or not metabolically active Fe due to the treatments. Principal component analysis of the data also provided a graphical tool to evaluate the evolution of plant responses to foliar Fe treatments with time."
"Sugarcane (Saccharumspp.) is an important economic crop, contributing up to 80% of table sugar used in the world and has become a promising feedstock for biofuel production. Sugarcane production has been threatened by many diseases, and fungicide applications for disease control have been opted out for sustainable agriculture. Orange rust is one of the major diseases impacting sugarcane production worldwide. Identifying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and developing diagnostic markers are valuable for breeding programs to expedite release of superior sugarcane cultivars for disease control. In this study, an F1segregating population derived from a cross between two hybrid sugarcane clones, CP95-1039 and CP88-1762, was evaluated for orange rust resistance in replicated trails. Three QTLs controlling orange rust resistance in sugarcane (qORR109, qORR4 and qORR102) were identified for the first time ever, which can explain 58, 12 and 8% of the phenotypic variation, separately. We also characterized 1,574 sugarcane putative resistance (R) genes. These sugarcane putativeRgenes and simple sequence repeats in the QTL intervals were further used to develop diagnostic markers for marker-assisted selection of orange rust resistance. A PCR-basedResistancegene-derived maker, G1 was developed, which showed significant association with orange rust resistance. The putative QTLs and marker developed in this study can be effectively utilized in sugarcane breeding programs to facilitate the selection process, thus contributing to the sustainable agriculture for orange rust disease control."
"Drought stress has adverse effects on growth, water relations, photosynthesis and yield of groundnut. WRKY transcription factors (TFs) are the plant-specific TFs which regulate several down-stream stress-responsive genes and play an essential role in plant biotic and abiotic stress responses. We found thatWRKY3gene is highly up-regulated under drought stress conditions and therefore isolated a newWRKY3TFgene from a drought-adapted horsegram (Macrotyloma uniflorumLam. Verdc.). Conserved domain studies revealed that protein encoded by this gene contains highly conserved regions of two WRKY domains and two C2H2 zinc-finger motifs. The fusion protein localization studies of transientMuWRKY3-YFP revealed its nuclear localization. Overexpression ofMuWRKY3TF gene in groundnut (Arachis hypogaeaL.) showed increased tolerance to drought stress compared to wild-type (WT) plants.MuWRKY3groundnut transgenics displayed lesser and delayed wilting symptoms than WT plants after 10-days of drought stress imposition. The transgenic groundnut plants expressingMuWRKY3showed less accumulation of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and superoxide anion (O2?-), accompanied by more free proline, total soluble sugar content, and activities of antioxidant enzymes than WT plants under drought stress. Moreover, a series of stress-relatedLEA, HSP, MIPS, APX, SOD, andCATgenes found up-regulated in the transgenic groundnut plants. The study demonstrates that nuclear-localizedMuWRKY3TF regulates the expression of stress-responsive genes and the activity of ROS scavenging enzymes which results in improved drought tolerance in groundnut. We conclude thatMuWRKY3may serve as a new putative candidate gene for the improvement of stress resistance in plants."
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs acting as regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In plants, most miRNAs are generated from independent transcriptional units, and only a few polycistronic miRNAs have been described. miR166 is a conserved miRNA in plants targeting theHD-ZIP IIItranscription factor genes. Here, we show that a polycistronic miRNA comprising two miR166 family members, miR166k and miR166h, functions as a positive regulator of rice immunity. Rice plants with activatedMIR166k-166hexpression showed enhanced resistance to infection by the fungal pathogensMagnaporthe oryzaeandFusarium fujikuroi, the causal agents of the rice blast and bakanae disease, respectively. Disease resistance in rice plants with activatedMIR166k-166hexpression was associated with a stronger expression of defense responses during pathogen infection. Stronger induction ofMIR166k-166hexpression occurred in resistant but not susceptible rice cultivars. Notably, theethylene-insensitive 2(EIN2) gene was identified as a novel target gene for miR166k. The regulatory role of the miR166h-166k polycistron on the newly identified target gene results from the activity of the miR166k-5p specie generated from the miR166k-166h precursor. Collectively, our findings support a role for miR166k-5p in rice immunity by controllingEIN2expression. Because rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases of cultivated rice worldwide, unraveling miR166k-166h-mediated mechanisms underlying blast resistance could ultimately help in designing appropriate strategies for rice protection."
"Plant cell cultures constitute a potentially efficient and sustainable tool for the production of high added-value bioactive compounds. However, due to the inherent restrictions in the expression of secondary metabolism, to date the yields obtained have generally been low. Plant cell culture elicitation can boost production, sometimes leading to dramatic improvements in yield, as well as providing insight into the target biosynthetic pathways and the regulation of the genes involved. Among the secondary compounds successfully being produced in biotechnological platforms are taxanes andtrans-resveratrol (t-R). In the current study, perfluorodecalins (PFDs) and hexenol (Hex) were tested for the first time withTaxus mediaandVitis viniferacell cultures to explore their effect on plant cell growth and secondary metabolite production, either alone or combined with other elicitors already established as highly effective, such as methyl jasmonate (MeJa), coronatine (Coro) or randomly methylated ?-cyclodextrins (?-CDs). The total taxane content at the peak of production inT. mediacell cultures treated with PFDs together with Coro plus ?-CDs was 3.3-fold higher than in the control, whereas thet-R production in MeJa and ?-CD-treatedV. viniferacell cultures increased 552.6-fold compared to the extremely low-yielding control. Hex was ineffective as an elicitorin V. viniferacell cultures, and inT. mediacell suspensions it blocked the taxol production but induced a clear enhancement of baccatin III. Regarding biosynthetic gene expression, a strong positive relationship was observed between the transcript level of targeted genes and taxol production in theT. mediacell cultures, but not witht-R production in the elicitedV. viniferacell cultures."
"Legume plants form symbiotic associations with either nitrogen-fixing bacteria or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which are regulated by a set of common symbiotic signaling pathway genes. Central to the signaling pathway is the activation of the DMI3/IPD3 protein complex by Ca2+oscillations, and the initiation of nodule organogenesis and mycorrhizal symbiosis. DMI3 is essential for rhizobial infection and nodule organogenesis; however,ipd3mutants have been shown to be impaired only in infection thread formation but not in root nodule organogenesis inMedicago truncatula. We identified anIPD3-like (IPD3L) gene in theM. truncatulagenome. A singleipd3lmutant exhibits a normal root nodule phenotype. Theipd3l/ipd3-2double mutant is completely unable to initiate infection threads and nodule primordia.IPD3Lcan functionally replaceIPD3when expressed under the control of the IPD3 promoter, indicating functional redundancy between these two transcriptional regulators. We constructed a version of IPD3 that was phosphomimetic with respect to two conserved serine residues (IPD3-2D). This was sufficient to trigger root nodule organogenesis, but the increased multisite phosphorylation of IPD3 (IPD3-8D) led to low transcriptional activity, suggesting that the phosphorylation levels of IPD3 fine-tune its transcriptional activity in the root nodule symbiosis. Intriguingly, the phosphomimetic version of IPD3 triggers spontaneous root-like nodules on the roots ofdmi3-1anddmi2-1(DMI2is an LRR-containing receptor-like kinase gene which is required for Ca2+spiking), but not on the roots of wild-type oripd3l ipd3-2plants. In addition, fully developed arbuscules were formed in theipd3l ipd3-2mutants but not theccamk/dmi3-1mutants. Collectively, our data indicate that, in addition toIPD3andIPD3L, another new genetic component or other new phosphorylation sites of IPD3 function downstream ofDMI3in rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbioses."
"The large ZBTB family comprises a diverse group of transcriptional factors. Several ZBTB proteins have emerged as critical factors that regulate the lineage commitment, differentiation, and function of lymphoid cells as well as many other developmental events. For instance, dysfunctions of ZBTB20 or ZBTB24 have been linked to multisystem failures in humans. Within the B-cell lineage, BCL6, ZBTB7A, ZBTB17, and ZBTB1 regulate the development/differentiation of B cells in both bone marrow and peripheral lymphoid organs, while ZBTB20 and ZBTB32 seem to mainly impact the maintenance of terminal plasma cells. Given the importance of B cells in the prevention and treatment of infectious or autoimmune disorders, we herein summarize the roles of seven ZBTB family members (BCL6, ZBTB7A, ZBTB17, ZBTB20, ZBTB32, ZBTB1, and ZBTB24) in the development, differentiation, and function of B cells as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms."
"Anthrax is an era old deadly disease against which there are only two currently available licensed vaccines named anthrax vaccine adsorbed and precipitated (AVP). Though they can provide a protective immunity, their multiple side-effects owing to their ill-defined composition and presence of toxic proteins (LF and EF) ofBacillus anthracis, the causative organism of anthrax, in the vaccine formulation makes their widespread use objectionable. Hence, an anthrax vaccine that contains well-defined and controlled components would be highly desirable. In this context, we have evaluated the potential of various vaccine formulations comprising of protective antigen (PA) encapsulated trimethyl-chitosan nanoparticles (TMC-PA) in conjunction with either CpG-C ODN 2395 (CpG) or Poly I:C. Each formulation was administeredviathree different routes, viz., subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), and intraperitoneal in female BALB/c mice. Irrespective of the route of immunization, CpG or Poly I:C adjuvanted TMC-PA nanoparticles induced a significantly higher humoral response (total serum IgG and its isotypes viz., IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b), compared to their CpG or Poly I:C PA counterparts. This clearly demonstrates the synergistic behavior of CpG and Poly I:C with TMC nanoparticles. The adjuvant potential of TMC nanoparticles could be observed in all the three routes as the TMC-PA nanoparticles by themselves induced IgG titers (1-1.5?×?105) significantly higher than both CpG PA and Poly I:C PA groups (2-8?×?104). The effect of formulations on T-helper (Th) cell development was assessed by quantifying the Th1-dependant (TNF-?, IFN-?, and IL-2), Th2-dependant (IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10), and Th17-type (IL-17A) cytokines. Adjuvanation with CpG and Poly I:C, the TMC-PA nanoparticles triggered a Th1 skewed immune response, as suggested by an increase in the levels of total IgG2a along with IFN-? cytokine production. Interestingly, the TMC-PA group showed a Th2-biased immune response. Upon challenge with theB. anthracisAmes strain, CpG and Poly I:C adjuvanted TMC-PA nanoparticles immunizedviathe SC and IM routes showed the highest protective efficacy of ~83%. Altogether, the results suggest that CpG or Poly I:C adjuvanted, PA-loaded TMC nanoparticles could be used as an effective, non-toxic, second generation subunit-vaccine candidate against anthrax."
"Mast cells reside on and near the cerebral vasculature, the predominant site of pneumococcal entry into the central nervous system (CNS). Although mast cells have been reported to be crucial in protecting from systemic bacterial infections, their role in bacterial infections of the CNS remained elusive. Here, we assessed the role of mast cells in pneumococcal infectionin vitroandin vivo. In introductory experiments using mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC), we found that (i) BMMC degranulate and release selected cytokines upon exposure toStreptococcus pneumoniae, (ii) the response of BMMC varies between different pneumococcal serotypes and (iii) is dependent on pneumolysin. Intriguingly though, apart from a slight enhancement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, neither two different mast cell-deficientKitmutant mouse strains (WBB6F1-KitW/Wvand C57BL/6KitW-sh/W-shmice) nor pharmacologic mast cell stabilization with cromoglycate had any significant impact on the disease phenotype of experimental pneumococcal meningitis. The incomplete reversal of the enhanced CSF pleocytosis by local mast cell engraftment suggests that this phenomenon is caused by other c-Kit mutation-related mechanisms than mast cell deficiency. In conclusion, our study suggests that mast cells can be activated byS. pneumoniae in vitro. However, mast cells do not play a significant role as sentinels of pneumococcal CSF invasion and initiators of innate immunityin vivo."
"Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) is a pluripotent and crucial dimer transcription factor that orchestrates various physiological and pathological processes, especially cell proliferation, inflammation, and cancer development and progression. NF-?B expression is transient and tightly regulated in normal cells, but it is activated in cancer cells. Recently, numerous studies have demonstrated microRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in the NF-?B signaling pathway and NF-?B-associated immune responses, radioresistance and drug resistance of cancer, some acting as inhibitors and the others as activators. Although it is still in infancy, targeting NF-?B or the NF-?B signaling pathway by miRNAs is becoming a promising strategy of cancer treatment."
"Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is an antibody-mediated blistering skin disease associated with tissue-bound and circulating autoantibodies to type VII collagen (COL7). Transfer of antibodies against COL7 into mice results in a subepidermal blistering phenotype, strictly depending on the complement component C5. Further, activation predominantly by the alternative pathway is required to induce experimental EBA, as blistering was delayed and significantly ameliorated only in factor B-/-mice. However, C5 deficiency not only blocked the activation of terminal complement components and assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC) but also eliminated the formation of C5a. Therefore, in the present study, we first aimed to elucidate which molecules downstream of C5 are relevant for blister formation in this EBA model and could be subsequently pharmaceutically targeted. For this purpose, we injected mice deficient in C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) or C6 with antibodies to murine COL7. Importantly,C5ar1-/-mice were significantly protected from experimental EBA, demonstrating that C5a-C5aR1 interactions are critical intermediates linking pathogenic antibodies to tissue damage in this experimental model of EBA. By contrast,C6-/-mice developed widespread blistering disease, suggesting that MAC is dispensable for blister formation in this model. In further experiments, we tested the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of complement components which were identified to play a key role in this experimental model. Complement components C5, factor B (fB), and C5aR1 were specifically targeted using complement inhibitors both prophylactically and in mice that had already developed disease. All complement inhibitors led to a significant improvement of the blistering phenotype when injected shortly before anti-COL7 antibodies. To simulate a therapeutic intervention, anti-fB treatment was first administered in full-blown EBA (day 5) and induced significant amelioration only in the final phase of disease evolution, suggesting that early intervention in disease development may be necessary to achieve higher efficacy. Anti-C5 treatment in incipient EBA (day 2) significantly ameliorated disease during the whole experiment. This finding is therapeutically relevant, since the humanized anti-C5 antibody eculizumab is already successfully used in patients. In conclusion, in this study, we have identified promising candidate molecules for complement-directed therapeutic intervention in EBA and similar autoantibody-mediated diseases."
"Keratins are crucial for the anchorage of desmosomes. Severe alterations of keratin organization and detachment of filaments from the desmosomal plaque occur in the autoimmune dermatoses pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus (PF), which are mainly caused by autoantibodies against desmoglein (Dsg) 1 and 3. Keratin alterations are a structural hallmark in pemphigus pathogenesis and correlate with loss of intercellular adhesion. However, the significance for autoantibody-induced loss of intercellular adhesion is largely unknown. In wild-type (wt) murine keratinocytes, pemphigus autoantibodies induced keratin filament retraction. Under the same conditions, we used murine keratinocytes lacking all keratin filaments (KtyII k.o.) as a model system to dissect the role of keratins in pemphigus. KtyII k.o. cells show compromised intercellular adhesion without antibody (Ab) treatment, which was not impaired further by pathogenic pemphigus autoantibodies. Nevertheless, direct activation of p38MAPKviaanisomycin further decreased intercellular adhesion indicating that cell cohesion was not completely abrogated in the absence of keratins. Direct inhibition of Dsg3, but not of Dsg1, interactionviapathogenic autoantibodies as revealed by atomic force microscopy was detectable in both cell lines demonstrating that keratins are not required for this phenomenon. However, PF-IgG shifted Dsg1-binding events from cell borders toward the free cell surface in wt cells. This led to a distribution pattern of Dsg1-binding events similar to KtyII k.o. cells under resting conditions. In keratin-deficient keratinocytes, PF-IgG impaired Dsg1-binding strength, which was not different from wt cells under resting conditions. In addition, pathogenic autoantibodies were capable of activating p38MAPK in both KtyII wt and k.o. cells, the latter of which already displayed robust p38MAPK activation under resting conditions. Since inhibition of p38MAPK blocked autoantibody-induced loss of intercellular adhesion in wt cells and restored baseline cell cohesion in keratin-deficient cells, we conclude that p38MAPK signaling is (i) critical for regulation of cell adhesion, (ii) regulated by keratins, and (iii) targets both keratin-dependent and -independent mechanisms."
"Langerhans cells (LCs), the epidermal dendritic cell (DC) subset, express the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor Met also known as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor. HGF is the exclusive ligand of Met and upon binding executes mitogenic, morphogenic, and motogenic activities to various cells. HGF exerts anti-inflammatory activitiesviaMet signaling and was found to regulate various functions of immune cells, including differentiation and maturation, cytokine production, cellular migration and adhesion, and T cell effector function. It has only recently become evident that a number of HGF-regulated functions in inflammatory processes and immune responses are impartedviaDCs. However, the mechanisms by which Met signaling in DCs conveys its immunoregulatory effects have not yet been fully understood. In this review, we focus on the current knowledge of Met signaling in DCs with particular attention on the morphogenic and motogenic activities. Met signaling was shown to promote DC mobility by regulating matrix metalloproteinase activities and adhesion. This is a striking resemblance to the role of Met in regulating a cell fate program during embryonic development, wound healing, and in tumor invasion known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Hence, we propose the concept that an EMT program is executed by Met signaling in LCs."
"Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, defined as CD161++TCR iV?7.2+T cells, play an important role in the innate defense against bacterial infections, and their functionality is impaired in chronic viral infections. Here, we investigated the frequency and functional role of MAIT cells in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The peripheral CD3+CD161++TCR iV?7.2+MAIT cells in chronic HBV-infected patients and healthy controls were phenotypically characterized based on CD57, PD-1, TIM-3, and CTLA-4, as well as HLA-DR and CD38 expression. The frequency of MAIT cells was significantly decreased among chronic HBV-infected individuals as compared to controls. Expression of CD57, PD-1, CTLA-4, as well as HLA-DR and CD38 on MAIT cells was significantly elevated in chronic HBV-infected individuals relative to controls. The percentage of T cell receptor (TCR) iV?7.2+CD161+MAIT cells did not correlate with HBV viral load but inversely with HLA-DR on CD4+T cells and MAIT cells and with CD57 on CD8+T cells suggesting that decrease of MAIT cells may not be attributed to direct infection by HBV but driven by HBV-induced chronic immune activation. The percentage and expression levels of PD-1 as well as CTLA-4 on MAIT cells inversely correlated with plasma HBV-DNA levels, which may suggest either a role for MAIT cells in the control of HBV infection or the effect of HBV replication in the liver on MAIT cell phenotype. We report that decrease of TCR iV?7.2+MAIT cells in the peripheral blood and their functions were seemingly impaired in chronic HBV-infected patients likely because of the increased expression of PD-1."
"Life-threatening cardiomyopathy is a severe, but common, complication associated with severe trauma or sepsis. Several signaling pathways involved in apoptosis and necroptosis are linked to trauma- or sepsis-associated cardiomyopathy. However, the underling causative factors are still debatable. Heparan sulfate (HS) fragments belong to the class of danger/damage-associated molecular patterns liberated from endothelial-bound proteoglycans by heparanase during tissue injury associated with trauma or sepsis. We hypothesized that HS induces apoptosis or necroptosis in murine cardiomyocytes. By using a novel Medical-In silicoapproach that combines conventional cell culture experiments with machine learning algorithms, we aimed to reduce a significant part of the expensive and time-consuming cell culture experiments and data generation by using computational intelligence (refinement and replacement). Cardiomyocytes exposed to HS showed an activation of the intrinsic apoptosis signal pathwayviacytochrome C and the activation of caspase 3 (bothp?<?0.001). Notably, the exposure of HS resulted in the induction of necroptosis by tumor necrosis factor ? and receptor interaction protein 3 (p?<?0.05;p?<?0.01) and, hence, an increased level of necrotic cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, using this novel Medical-In silicoapproach, our data suggest (i) that HS induces necroptosis in cardiomyocytes by phosphorylation (activation) of receptor-interacting protein 3, (ii) that HS is a therapeutic target in trauma- or sepsis-associated cardiomyopathy, and (iii) indicate that this proof-of-concept is a first step toward simulating the extent of activated components in the pro-apoptotic pathway induced by HS with only a small data set gained from thein vitroexperiments by using machine learning algorithms."
"The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a highly conserved protein complex involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Its metalloisopeptidase activity resides in subunit 5 (CSN5). Functions ofcsn5in phytopathogenic fungi are poorly understood. Here, we knocked out thecsn5ortholog (Aacsn5) in the tangerine pathotype ofAlternaria alternata. The ?Aacsn5mutant showed a moderately reduced growth rate compared to the wildtype strain and was unable to produce conidia. The growth of ?Aacsn5mutant was not affected in response to oxidative and osmotic stresses. Virulence assays revealed that ?Aacsn5induced no or significantly reduced necrotic lesions on detached citrus leaves. The defects in hyphal growth, conidial sporulation, and pathogenicity of ?Aacsn5were restored by genetic complementation of the mutant with wildtypeAacsn5. To explore the molecular mechanisms of conidiation and pathogenesis underlyingAacsn5regulation, we systematically examined the transcriptomes of both ?Aacsn5and the wildtype. Generally, 881 genes were overexpressed and 777 were underexpressed in the ?Aacsn5mutant during conidiation while 694 overexpressed and 993 underexpressed during infection. During asexual development, genes related to the transport processes and nitrogen metabolism were significantly downregulated; the expression ofcsn1-4andcsn7in ?Aacsn5was significantly elevated; secondary metabolism gene clusters were broadly affected; especially, the transcript level of the whole of cluster 28 and 30 was strongly induced. During infection, the expression of the host-specific ACT toxin gene cluster which controls the biosynthesis of the citrus specific toxin was significantly repressed; many other SM clusters with unknown products were also regulated; 86 out of 373 carbohydrate-active enzymes responsible for breaking down the plant dead tissues showed uniquely decreased expression. Taken together, our results expand our understanding of the roles ofcsn5on conidiation and pathogenicity in plant pathogenic fungi and provide a foundation for future investigations."
"During Chagas disease, theTrypanosoma cruzican induce some changes in the host cells in order to escape or manipulate the host immune response. The modulation of the lipid metabolism in the host phagocytes or in the parasite itself is one feature that has been observed. The goal of this mini review is to discuss the mechanisms that regulate intracellular lipid body (LB) biogenesis in the course of this parasite infection and their meaning to the pathophysiology of the disease. The interaction host-parasite induces LB (or lipid droplet) formation in a Toll-like receptor 2-dependent mechanism in macrophages and is enhanced by apoptotic cell uptake. Simultaneously, there is a lipid accumulation in the parasite due to the incorporation of host fatty acids. The increase in the LB accumulation during infection is correlated with an increase in the synthesis of PGE2within the host cells and the parasite LBs. Moreover, the treatment with fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75 or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as NS-398 and aspirin inhibited the LB biogenesis and also induced the down modulation of the eicosanoid production and the parasite replication. These findings show that LBs are organelles up modulated during the course of infection. Furthermore, the biogenesis of the LB is involved in the lipid mediator generation by both the macrophages and the parasite triggering escape mechanisms."
"Microfluidics is an emerging technology that is used more and more in biology experiments. Its capabilities of creating precisely controlled conditions in cellular dimensions make it ideal to explore cell-cell and cell-environment interactions. Thus, a wide spectrum of problems in microbial ecology can be studied using engineered microbial habitats. Moreover, artificial microfluidic ecosystems can serve as model systems to test ecology theories and principles that apply on a higher level in the hierarchy of biological organization. In this mini review we aim to demonstrate the versatility of microfluidics and the diversity of its applications that help the advance of microbiology, and in more general, experimental ecology."
"Skin symbiotic bacteria on amphibians can play a role in protecting their host against pathogens. Chytridiomycosis, the disease caused byBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd, has caused dramatic population declines and extinctions of amphibians worldwide. Anti-Bd bacteria from amphibian skin have been cultured, and skin bacterial communities have been described through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Here, we present a shotgun metagenomic analysis of skin bacterial communities from a Neotropical frog,Craugastor fitzingeri. We sequenced the metagenome of six frogs from two different sites in Panamá: three frogs from Soberanía (Sob), a Bd-endemic site, and three frogs from Serranía del Sapo (Sapo), a Bd-naïve site. We described the taxonomic composition of skin microbiomes and found thatPseudomonaswas a major component of these communities. We also identified that Sob communities were enriched in Actinobacteria while Sapo communities were enriched in Gammaproteobacteria. We described gene abundances within the main functional classes and found genes enriched either in Sapo or Sob. We then focused our study on five functional classes of genes: biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, membrane transport, cellular communication and antimicrobial drug resistance. These gene classes are potentially involved in bacterial communication, bacterial-host and bacterial-pathogen interactions among other functions. We found thatC. fitzingerimetagenomes have a wide array of genes that code for secondary metabolites, including antibiotics and bacterial toxins, which may be involved in bacterial communication, but could also have a defensive role against pathogens. Several genes involved in bacterial communication and bacterial-host interactions, such as biofilm formation and bacterial secretion systems were found. We identified specific genes and pathways enriched at the different sites and determined that gene co-occurrence networks differed between sites. Our results suggest that skin microbiomes are composed of distinct bacterial taxa with a wide range of metabolic capabilities involved in bacterial defense and communication. Differences in taxonomic composition and pathway enrichments suggest that skin microbiomes from different sites have unique functional properties. This study strongly supports the need for shotgun metagenomic analyses to describe the functional capacities of skin microbiomes and to tease apart their role in host defense against pathogens."
"Over the last years the role of fungal endophytes in plant biology has been extensively studied. A number of species were shown to positively affect plant growth and fitness, thus attempts have been made to utilize these microorganisms in agriculture and phytoremediation. Plant-fungi symbiosis requires multiple metabolic adjustments of both of the interacting organisms. The mechanisms of these adaptations are mostly unknown, however, plant hormones seem to play a central role in this process. The plant hormone strigolactone (SL) was previously shown to activate hyphae branching of mycorrhizal fungi and to negatively affect pathogenic fungi growth. Its role in the plant-endophytic fungi interaction is unknown. The effect of the synthetic SL analog GR24 on the endophytic fungiMucorsp. growth, respiration, H2O2production and the activity of antioxidant enzymes was evaluated. We found fungi colony growth rate was decreased in a GR24 concentration dependent manner. Additionally, the fungi accumulated more H2O2what was accompanied by an altered activity of antioxidant enzymes. Symbiosis withMucorsp. positively affectedArabidopsis thalianagrowth, but SL was necessary for the establishment of the beneficial interaction.A. thalianabiosynthesis mutantsmax1andmax4, but not the SL signaling mutantmax2did not develop the beneficial phenotype. The negative growth response was correlated with alterations in SA homeostasis and a significant upregulation of genes encoding selected plant defensins. The fungi were also shown to be able to decompose SLin plantaand to downregulate the expression of SL biosynthesis genes. Additionally, we have shown that GR24 treatment with a dose of 1 ?M activates the production of SA inA. thaliana. The results presented here provide evidence for a role of SL in the plant-endophyte cross-talk during the mutualistic interaction betweenArabidopsis thalianaandMucorsp."
"The soybean cyst nematode (SCN),Heterodera glycinesIchinohe (Phylum Nematoda), is a major pathogen of soybean. It causes substantial yield losses worldwide and is difficult to control because the cyst protects the eggs which can remain viable for nearly a decade. Crop rotation with non-host crops and use of biocontrol organisms such as fungi and bacteria offer promising approaches, but remain hampered by lack of knowledge of the biology of nematode parasitic organisms. We used a high-throughput metabarcoding approach to characterize fungal communities associated with the SCN cyst, a microenvironment in soil that may harbor both nematode parasites and plant pathogens. SCN cysts were collected from a long-term crop rotation experiment in Southeastern Minnesota at three time points over two growing seasons to characterize diversity of fungi inhabiting cysts and to examine how crop rotation and seasonal variation affects fungal communities. A majority of fungi in cysts belonged to Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, but the presence of several early diverging fungal subphyla thought to be primarily plant and litter associated, including Mortierellomycotina and Glomeromycotina (e.g., arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi), suggests a possible role as nematode egg parasites. Species richness varied by both crop rotation and season and was higher in early years of crop rotation and in fall at the end of the growing season. Crop rotation and season also impacted fungal community composition and identified several classes of fungi, including Eurotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Orbiliomycetes (e.g., nematode trapping fungi), with higher relative abundance in early soybean rotations. The relative abundance of several genera was correlated with increasing years of soybean. Fungal communities also varied by season and were most divergent at midseason. The percentage of OTUs assigned to Mortierellomycotina_cls_Incertae_sedis and Sordariomycetes increased at midseason, while Orbiliomycetes decreased at midseason, and Glomeromycetes increased in fall. Ecological guilds of fungi containing an animal-pathogen lifestyle, as well as potential egg-parasitic taxa previously isolated from parasitized SCN eggs, increased at midseason. The animal pathogen guilds included known (e.g.,Pochonia chlamydosporia) and new candidate biocontrol organisms. This research advances knowledge of the ecology of nematophagous fungi in agroecosystems and their use as biocontrol agents of the SCN."
"To investigate whether mid-luteal serum progesterone (P4) exhibits significant fluctuations during a 12-h daytime period in women undergoingin vitrofertilization (IVF) and to explore whether the extent of these fluctuations could impact the interpretation of luteal progesterone levels in a clinical setting.Explorative pilot study.Public hospital-based fertility unit.Ten women undergoing IVF treatment.Seven days after oocyte pick-up, patients underwent frequent repeated blood sampling (every 60?min for 12?h and during two of these hours, every 15?min). Serum samples were analyzed for progesterone, estradiol, and luteinizing hormone (LH).Daytime fluctuations in s-progesterone and s-estradiol.There was a significant positive correlation between median P4levels and the magnitude of P4variations-women with median P4?<?60?nmol/l had clinically stable P4levels throughout the day, while patients with median P4?>?250?nmol/l exhibited periodic P4peaks of several hundred nanomoles per liter. These endogenous P4fluctuations were observed irrespective of the type of stimulation protocol or mode of triggering of final oocyte maturation and despite the fact that LH was under the detection limit at the time of measurement. Simultaneously, large fluctuations were seen in s-estradiol.Monitoring of early to mid-luteal P4levels in IVF cycles may be valuable in the planning of individualized luteal phase support in the attempt to increase reproductive outcomes. The prerequisite for luteal phase monitoring is, however, that the validity of a single measured P4value is reliable. We show for the first time, that a single P4measurement in the low progesterone patient quite accurately reflects the corpus luteum function and that the measurement can be used to detect IVF patients with a need of additional exogenous luteal P4administration."
"The first indication of a potential mechanistic link between the pathobiology of the human gastrointestinal (GI)-tract microbiome and its contribution to the pathogenetic mechanisms of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) came a scant 4?years ago (1). Ongoing research continues to strengthen the hypothesis that neurotoxic microbial-derived components of the GI tract microbiome can cross aging GI tract and blood-brain barriers and contribute to progressive proinflammatory neurodegeneration, as exemplified by the AD-process. Of central interest in these recent investigations are the pathological roles played by human GI tract resident Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria and neurotropic viruses-two prominent divisions of GI tract microbiome-derived microbiota-which harbor considerable pathogenic potential. It is noteworthy that the first two well-studied microbiota-the GI tract abundant Gram-negative bacteriaBacteroides fragilisand the neurotropicherpes simplex virus-1both share a final common pathway of NF-?B (p50/p65) activation and microRNA-146a induction with ensuing pathogenic stimulation of innate-immune and neuroinflammatory pathways. These appear to strongly contribute to the inflammation-mediated amyloidogenic neuropathology of AD. This communication: (i) will review recent research contributions that have expanded our understanding of the nature of the translocation of microbiome-derived neurotoxins-across biophysiological barriers; (ii) will assess multiple-recent investigations of the induction of the proinflammatory pathogenic microRNA-146a by these two prominent classes of human microbiota; and (iii) will discuss the role of molecular neurobiology and mechanistic contribution of polymicrobial infections to AD-type neuropathological change."
"According to the fear module theory, humans are evolutionarily predisposed to perceive snakes as prioritized stimuli and exhibit a fast emotional and behavioral response toward them. In Europe, highly dangerous snake species are distributed almost exclusively in the Mediterranean and Caspian areas. While the risk of a snakebite is relatively low in Central Europe, Azerbaijan, on the other hand, has a high occurrence of the deadly venomous Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetina). We hypothesize that co-habitation with this dangerous snake has shaped the way in which humans evaluate snake species resembling it. For that purpose, we asked respondents from the Czech Republic and Azerbaijan to rank photographs depicting 36 snake species according to perceived fear and beauty. The results revealed a high cross-cultural agreement in both evaluations (fearr2= 0.683,p< 0.0001; beauty:r2= 0.816,p< 0.0001). Snakes species eliciting higher fear tend to be also perceived as more beautiful, yet people are able to clearly distinguish between these two dimensions. Deadly venomous snakes representing a serious risk are perceived as highly fearful. This is especially true for the vipers and allies (pit vipers) possessing a characteristic body shape with a distinct triangular head and thick body, which was found as the most fear evoking by respondents from both countries. Although the attitude toward snakes is more negative among the respondents from Azerbaijan, their fear evaluation is similar to the Czechs. For instance, despite co-habitation with the Levant viper, it was not rated by the Azerbaijanis as more fearful than other dangerous snakes. In conclusion, agreement in the evaluation of snake fear and beauty is cross-culturally high and relative fear attributed to selected snake species is not directly explainable by the current environmental and cultural differences. This may provide some support for the evolutionary hypothesis of preparedness to fear snakes."
"Endothelial cells surround the lumen of blood vessels and modulate many physiological processes, including vascular tone, blood fluidity, inflammation, immunity and neovascularization. Many pathological conditions, including hyperglycemia, may alter endothelial function through oxidative stress, leading to impaired nitric oxide bioavailability and to the onset of an inflammatory state. As widely shown in the last decade, dietary intervention could represent a good strategy to control endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. In particular, extensive research in the field of antioxidant natural derivatives has been conducted. In this study, we evaluated the capability of Chamazulene (Cham), an azulene compound from chamomile essential oil, to attenuate ROS levels in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) stressed with either high glucose or H2O2. Cell viability at different concentrations of Cham was evaluated through the WST-1 assay, while ROS production acutely induced by High Glucose (HG, 4.5 g/L) treatment or H2O2(0.5 mM) for 3 h, was quantified with 2'-7'-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Our results showed a reduction in ROS produced after simultaneous treatment with High Glucose or H2O2and Cham, thus suggesting anin vitroantioxidant activity of the compound. On the whole, this study shows for the first time the potential role of Cham as a scavenging molecule, suggesting its possible use to prevent the rise of endothelial ROS levels and the consequent vascular damage."
"Prolonged periods of skeletal muscle inactivity or mechanical unloading (bed rest, hindlimb unloading, immobilization, spaceflight and reduced step) can result in a significant loss of musculoskeletal mass, size and strength which ultimately lead to muscle atrophy. With advancement in understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in disuse skeletal muscle atrophy, several different signaling pathways have been studied to understand their regulatory role in this process. However, substantial gaps exist in our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved, as well as their functional significance. This review aims to update the current state of knowledge and the underlying cellular mechanisms related to skeletal muscle loss during a variety of unloading conditions, both in humans and animals. Recent advancements in understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms, including IGF1-Akt-mTOR, MuRF1/MAFbx, FOXO, and potential triggers of disuse atrophy, such as calcium overload and ROS overproduction, as well as their role in skeletal muscle protein adaptation to disuse is emphasized. We have also elaborated potential therapeutic countermeasures that have shown promising results in preventing and restoring disuse-induced muscle loss. Finally, identified are the key challenges in this field as well as some future prospectives."
"We show that the level of the core protein of the circadian clock Period (PER) expressed by glial peripheral oscillators depends on their location in theDrosophilaoptic lobe. It appears to be controlled by the ventral lateral neurons (LNvs) that release the circadian neurotransmitter Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF). We demonstrate that glial cells of the distal medulla neuropil (dMnGl) that lie in the vicinity of the PDF-releasing terminals of the LNvs possess receptors for PDF (PDFRs) and express PER at significantly higher level than other types of glia. Surprisingly, the amplitude of PER molecular oscillations in dMnGl is increased twofold in PDF-free environment, that is inPdf0mutants. ThePdf0mutants also reveal an increased level of glia-specific protein REPO in dMnGl. The photoreceptors of the compound eye (R-cells) of the PDF-null flies, on the other hand, exhibit de-synchrony of PER molecular oscillations, which manifests itself as increased variability of PER-specific immunofluorescence among the R-cells. Moreover, the daily pattern of expression of the presynaptic protein Bruchpilot (BRP) in the lamina terminals of the R-cells is changed inPdf0mutant. Considering that PDFRs are also expressed by the marginal glia of the lamina that surround the R-cell terminals, the LNv pacemakers appear to be the likely modulators of molecular cycling in the peripheral clocks of both the glial cells and the photoreceptors of the compound eye. Consequently, some form of PDF-based coupling of the glial clocks and the photoreceptors of the eye with the central LNv pacemakers must be operational."
"                    Background:
Endothelial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the initiation of atherosclerosis. Vascular insulin resistance might contribute to a reduction in endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production, leading to impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation in cardiometabolic diseases. Because perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) controls endothelial function and NO bioavailability, we hypothesized a role for this fat deposit in the vascular complications associated with the initial stages of atherosclerosis. Therefore, we investigated the potential involvement of PVAT in the early endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemic LDL receptor knockout mice (LDLr-KO).Methods:Thoracic aortas with and without PVAT were isolated from 4-month-old C57BL/6J (WT) and LDLr-KO mice. The contribution of PVAT to relaxation responses to acetylcholine, insulin, and sodium nitroprusside was investigated. Western blotting was used to examine endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and adiponectin expression, as well the insulin signaling pathway in aortic PVAT.Results:PVAT-free aortas of LDLr-KO mice exhibited impaired acetylcholine- and insulin-induced relaxation compared with those of WT mice. Both vasodilatory responses were restored by the presence of PVAT in LDLr-KO mice, associated with enhanced acetylcholine-induced NO levels. PVAT did not change vasodilatory responses to acetylcholine and insulin in WT mice, while vascular relaxation evoked by the NO donor sodium nitroprusside was not modified by either genotype or PVAT. The expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT, ERK1/2, phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), and adiponectin was similar in the PVAT of WT and LDLr-KO mice, suggesting no changes in PVAT insulin signaling. However, eNOS expression was enhanced in the PVAT of LDLr-KO mice, while eNOS expression was less abundant in PVAT-free aortas.Conclusion:These results suggest that elevated eNOS-derived NO production in aortic PVAT might be a compensatory mechanism for the endothelial dysfunction and impaired vasodilator action of insulin in hypercholesterolemic LDLr-deficient mice. This protective effect may limit the progression of atherosclerosis in genetic hypercholesterolemia in the absence of an atherogenic diet."
"Maintenance of homeostasis in the respiratory and cardiovascular systems depends on reflexes that are initiated at specialized peripheral chemoreceptors that sense changes in the chemical composition of arterial blood. In mammals, the bilaterally-paired carotid bodies (CBs) are the main peripheral chemoreceptor organs that are richly vascularized and are strategically located at the carotid bifurcation. The CBs contribute to the maintenance of O2, CO2/H+, and glucose homeostasis and have attracted much clinical interest because hyperactivity in these organs is associated with several pathophysiological conditions including sleep apnea, obstructive lung disease, heart failure, hypertension, and diabetes. In response to a decrease in O2availability (hypoxia) and elevated CO2/H+(acid hypercapnia), CB receptor type I (glomus) cells depolarize and release neurotransmitters that stimulate apposed chemoafferent nerve fibers. The central projections of those fibers in turn activate cardiorespiratory centers in the brainstem, leading to an increase in ventilation and sympathetic drive that helps restore blood PO2and protect vital organs, e.g., the brain. Significant progress has been made in understanding how neurochemicals released from type I cells such as ATP, adenosine, dopamine, 5-HT, ACh, and angiotensin II help shape the CB afferent discharge during both normal and pathophysiological conditions. However, type I cells typically occur in clusters and in addition to their sensory innervation are ensheathed by the processes of neighboring glial-like, sustentacular type II cells. This morphological arrangement is reminiscent of a ""tripartite synapse"" and emerging evidence suggests that paracrine stimulation of type II cells by a variety of CB neurochemicals may trigger the release of ""gliotransmitters"" such as ATP via pannexin-1 channels. Further, recent data suggest novel mechanisms by which dopamine, acting via D2 receptors (D2R), may inhibit action potential firing at petrosal nerve endings. This review will update current ideas concerning the presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms that underlie chemosensory processing in the CB. Paracrine signaling pathways will be highlighted, and particularly those that allow the glial-like type II cells to participate in the integrated sensory response during exposures to chemostimuli, including acute and chronic hypoxia."
"Light-sensitivity is important for mollusc survival, as it plays a vital role in reproduction and predator avoidance. Light-sensitivity has been demonstrated in the adult Pacific oysterCrassostrea gigas, but the genes associated with light-sensitivity remain unclear. In the present study, we designed experiments to identify the genes associated with light-sensitivity in adult oysters. First, we assessed the Pacific oyster genome and identified 368 genes annotated with the terms associated with light-sensitivity. Second, the function of the four rhodopsin-like superfamily member genes was tested by using RNAi. The results showed that the highest level of mRNA expression of the vision-related genes was in the mantle; however, this finding is not true for all oyster genes. Interestingly, we also found four rhodopsin-like superfamily member genes expressed at an very high level in the mantle tissue. In the RNAi experiment, when one of rhodopsin-like superfamily member genes (CGI_1001253) was inhibited, the light-sensitivity capacity of the injected oysters was significantly reduced, suggesting that CGI_10012534 may be associated with light-sensitivity in the adult Pacific oyster."
"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are non-hematopoietic progenitor cells, which can be isolated from different types of tissues including bone marrow, adipose tissue, tooth pulp, and placenta/umbilical cord blood. There isolation from adult tissues circumvents the ethical concerns of working with embryonic or fetal stem cells, whilst still providing cells capable of differentiating into various cell lineages, such as adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes. An important feature of MSCs is the low immunogenicity due to the lack of co-stimulatory molecules expression, meaning there is no need for immunosuppression during allogenic transplantation. The tropism of MSCs to damaged tissues and tumor sites makes them a promising vector for therapeutic agent delivery to tumors and metastatic niches. MSCs can be genetically modified by virus vectors to encode tumor suppressor genes, immunomodulating cytokines and their combinations, other therapeutic approaches include MSCs priming/loading with chemotherapeutic drugs or nanoparticles. MSCs derived membrane microvesicles (MVs), which play an important role in intercellular communication, are also considered as a new therapeutic agent and drug delivery vector. Recruited by the tumor, MSCs can exhibit both pro- and anti-oncogenic properties. In this regard, for the development of new methods for cancer therapy using MSCs, a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular interactions between MSCs and the tumor microenvironment is necessary. In this review, we discuss MSC and tumor interaction mechanisms and review the new therapeutic strategies using MSCs and MSCs derived MVs for cancer treatment."
"Adenosine A2Areceptors (A2AR) are activated upon increased synaptic activity to assist in the implementation of long-term plastic changes at synapses. While it is reported that A2AR are involved in the control of prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent behavior such as working memory, reversal learning and effort-based decision making, it is not known whether A2AR control glutamatergic synapse plasticity within the medial PFC (mPFC). To elucidate that, we tested whether A2AR blockade affects long-term plasticity (LTP) of excitatory post-synaptic potentials in pyramidal neurons and fast spiking (FS) interneurons in layer 5 of the mPFC and of population spikes. Our results show that A2AR are enriched at mPFC synapses, where their blockade reversed the direction of plasticity at excitatory synapses onto layer 5 FS interneurons from LTP to long-term depression, while their blockade had no effect on the induction of LTP at excitatory synapses onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons. At the network level, extracellularly induced LTP of population spikes was reduced by A2AR blockade. The interneuron-specificity of A2AR in controlling glutamatergic synapse LTP may ensure that during periods of high synaptic activity, a proper excitation/inhibition balance is maintained within the mPFC."
"Epidemiological studies suggest there is an association between midlife hypertension and increased risk of late-life Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether hypertension accelerates the onset of AD or is a distinct disease that becomes more prevalent with age (comorbidity) remains unclear. This study aimed to test the possible relationship between hypertension and AD pathogenesis. Two animal models were used in this study. For the first model, 7-month-old Lanyu-miniature-pigs were given the abdominal aortic constriction operation to induce hypertension and their AD-related pathologies were assessed at 1, 2, and 3 months after the operation. The results showed that hypertension was detected since 1 month after the operation in the pigs. Levels of A?, amyloid precursor protein, RAGE, phosphorylated tau and activated GSK3? in the hippocampi increased at 3 months after the operation. For the second model, 3xTg mice at the ages of 2, 5, and 7 months were subjected to the ""two-kidney-one-clip"" operation to induce hypertension. One month after the operation, blood pressure was significantly increased in the 3xTg mice in any age. A?, amyloid plaque load, and phosphorylated tau levels increased in the operated mice. Furthermore, the operation also induced shrinkage in the dendritic arbor of hippocampal dentate gyrus granule neurons, leakage in the blood-brain barrier, activation in microglia, and impairment in the hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in the 3xTg mice. In conclusion, hypertension accelerates the onset of AD. Blood pressure control during midlife may delay the onset of AD."
"Amyloid-? (A?) peptides play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), due to its neurotoxicity. Thus, blocking A? generation and aggregation in the brain has been realized as an efficient way for the prevention of AD. The natural product catalpol, isolated fromRehmannia glutinosa, has shown neuroprotective activities through inhibiting soluble A? production, degrading A? peptide, and attenuating A? toxicity and neuroinflammatory responses. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate whether catalpol reduce A? generation associated with regulating amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolytic processing. By using Swedish mutant APP overexpressed N2a (SweAPP N2a) cells treated with catalpol, we found that catalpol was not able to reduce the expression levels of ?-secretase (BACE-1) and ?-secretase (PS1, APH-1, PEN-2 and Nicastrin). By contrast, catalpol had a significant promotion effect on the expression of ?-secretase (ADAM10) and its proteolytic products, sAPP? and C83, suggesting that catalpol reduced the production of A? might be involved in non-amyloidogenic APP pathway. In addition, we confirmed that the extracellular signal-related kinase/cAMP-response element binding protein (ERK/CREB) signaling pathways were responsible for the up-regulation of ADAM10 in catalpol-treated SweAPP N2a cells. The present data, for the first time, have demonstrated that the effect of catalpol on the inhibiting A? generation might be closely related to ?-cleavage of APP processing."
"Previously, we have shown that the transcription factor nuclear factor interleukin (NF-IL)6 can be used as an activation marker for inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced and psychological novel environment stress (NES) in the rat brain. Here, we aimed to investigate age dependent changes of hypothalamic and pituitary responses to NES (cage switch) or LPS (100 ?g/kg) in 2 and 24 months old rats. Animals were sacrificed at specific time points, blood and brains withdrawn and analyzed using immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and bioassays. In the old rats, telemetric recording revealed that NES-induced hyperthermia was enhanced and prolonged compared to the young group. Plasma IL-6 levels remained unchanged and hypothalamic IL-6 mRNA expression was increased in the old rats. Interestingly, this response was accompanied by a significant upregulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA expression only in young rats after NES and overall higher plasma corticosterone levels in all aged animals. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant upregulation of NF-IL6-positive cells in the pituitary after NES or LPS-injection. In another important brain structure implicated in immune-to-brain communication, namely, in the median eminence (ME), NF-IL6-immunoreactivity was increased in aged animals, while the young group showed just minor activation after LPS-stimulation. Interestingly, we found a higher amount of NF-IL6-CD68-positive cells in the posterior pituitary of old rats compared to the young counterparts. Moreover, aging affected the regulation of cytokine interaction in the anterior pituitary lobe. LPS-treatment significantly enhanced the secretion of the cytokines IL-6 and TNF? into supernatants of primary cell cultures of the anterior pituitary. Furthermore, in the young rats, incubation with IL-6 and IL-10 antibodies before LPS-stimulation led to a robust decrease of IL-6 production and an increase of TNF? production by the pituitary cells. In the old rats, this specific cytokine interaction could not be detected. Overall, the present results revealed strong differences in the activation patterns and pathways between old and young rats after both stressors. The prolonged hyperthermic and inflammatory response seen in aged animals seems to be linked to dysregulated pituitary cytokine interactions and brain cell activation (NF-IL6) in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis."
"Social behavior is often described as a unified concept, but highly social (group-living) species exhibit distinct social structures and may make different social decisions. Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) are socially monogamous rodents that often reside in extended family groups, and exhibit robust preferences forfamiliarsocial partners (same- and opposite-sex) during extended choice tests, although short-term preferences are not known. Mice (Mus musculus) are gregarious and colonial, but in brief laboratory tests of social preference they typically prefer social novelty. This preference for novel vs. familiar peers may represent a species-specific difference in social decision-making between mice and prairie voles. However, the tests used to measure preferences in each species differ markedly in duration and degree of contact, such that the behaviors cannot be directly compared. We assessed whether social preferences for novelty or familiarity differed between mice and prairie voles of both sexes when assessed with matching protocols: the sociability/social preference test (SPT) typically used in mice (short, no direct contact), and the partner preference test (PPT) used in voles (long, direct contact). A subset of voles also underwent a PPT using barriers (long, no direct contact). In the short SPT, behavior did not differ between species. In the longer test, pronounced partner preferences emerged in prairie voles, but mice exhibited no social preferences and rarely huddled. No sex differences were evident in either test. Direct physical contact was required for partner preferences in huddling time in voles, but preference for the partner chamber was evident with or without contact. Both prairie voles and mice are social, but they exhibit important differences in the specificity and extent of their social behavior. While mice are often used to study social approach and other behaviors, voles are a more suitable species for the study of selective social relationships. Consideration of these differences will be important for studies examining the neural mechanisms supporting different kinds of peer social behavior."
"Nicotine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, produces the reinforcing effects of tobacco dependence by potentiating dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. Non-nicotine alkaloids in tobacco also contribute to dependence by activating the cholinergic system. However, glutamatergic neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum associated with behavioral changes in response to cigarette smoking has not been investigated. In this study, the authors investigated alterations in glutamate levels in the rat dorsal striatum related to behavioral alterations after repeated administration of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) using the real-time glutamate biosensing and an open-field behavioral assessment. Repeated administration of CSC including 0.4 mg nicotine (1.0 mL/kg/day, subcutaneous) for 14 days significantly increased extracellular glutamate concentrations more than repeated nicotine administration. In parallel with the hyperactivation of glutamate levels, repeated administration of CSC-evoked prolonged hypersensitization of psychomotor activity, including locomotor and rearing activities. These findings suggest that the CSC-induced psychomotor activities are closely associated with the elevation of glutamate concentrations in the rat dorsal striatum."
"A comparison between the axon terminals of octopaminergic efferent dorsal or ventral unpaired median neurons in either desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) or fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) across skeletal muscles reveals many similarities. In both species the octopaminergic axon forms beaded fibers where the boutons or varicosities form type II terminals in contrast to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) or type I terminals. These type II terminals are immunopositive for both tyramine and octopamine and, in contrast to the type I terminals, which possess clear synaptic vesicles, only contain dense core vesicles. These dense core vesicles contain octopamine as shown by immunogold methods. With respect to the cytomatrix and active zone peptides the type II terminals exhibit active zone-like accumulations of the scaffold protein Bruchpilot (BRP) only sparsely in contrast to the many accumulations of BRP identifying active zones of NMJ type I terminals. In the fruit fly larva marked dynamic changes of octopaminergic fibers have been reported after short starvation which not only affects the formation of new branches (""synaptopods"") but also affects the type I terminals or NMJs via octopamine-signaling (Koon et al., 2011). Our starvation experiments ofDrosophila-larvae revealed a time-dependency of the formation of additional branches. Whereas after 2 h of starvation we find a decrease in ""synaptopods"", the increase is significant after 6 h of starvation. In addition, we provide evidence that the release of octopamine from dendritic and/or axonal type II terminals uses a similar synaptic machinery to glutamate release from type I terminals of excitatory motor neurons. Indeed, blocking this canonical synaptic release machinery via RNAi induced downregulation of BRP in neurons with type II terminals leads to flight performance deficits similar to those observed for octopamine mutants or flies lacking this class of neurons (Brembs et al., 2007)."
"Dopaminergic neurons of the descending diencephalospinal system are located in the posterior tuberculum (PT) in zebrafish (Danio rerio), and correspond in mammals to the A11 group in hypothalamus and thalamus. In the larval zebrafish, they are likely the only source of central dopaminergic projections to the periphery. Here, we characterized posterior tubercular dopaminergic fibers projecting to peripheral sense organs, with a focus on the lateral line neuromasts. We labeled and identified catecholaminergic neurons and their projections by combining two immunofluorescence techniques, (i) using an antibody against Tyrosine hydroxylase, and (ii) using an antibody against GFP in transgenic zebrafish expressing in catecholaminergic neurons either membrane-anchored GFP to track fibers, or a Synaptophysin-GFP fusion to visualize putative synapses. We applied the CLARITY method to 6 days old whole zebrafish larvae to stain and analyze dopaminergic projections by confocal microscopy. We found that all lateral line neuromasts receive direct innervation by posterior tubercular dopaminergic neurons, and tracked these projections in detail. In addition, we found dopaminergic fibers projecting to the anterior and posterior lateral line ganglia, and extensive central dopaminergic arborizations around the terminal projection field of the lateral line afferent neurons in the hindbrain medial octavolateralis nucleus (MON). Therefore, dopaminergic innervation may affect lateral line sense information at different processing stages. Additional dopaminergic fibers innervate the trigeminal ganglion, and we observed fine catecholaminergic fibers in the skin with arborization patterns similar to free sensory nerve endings. We also detected potentially dopaminergic fibers innervating inner ear sensory epithelia. Therefore, the diencephalospinal A11-type dopaminergic system may broadly modulate peripheral senses. We also briefly report peripheral sympathetic catecholaminergic projections labeled in our experiments, and their innervation of the developing intestine, swim bladder and abdominal organs."
"The e-vector orientation of linearly polarized light represents an important visual stimulus for many insects. Especially the detection of polarized skylight by many navigating insect species is known to improve their orientation skills. While great progress has been made towards describing both the anatomy and function of neural circuit elements mediating behaviors related to navigation, relatively little is known about how insects perceive non-celestial polarized light stimuli, like reflections off water, leaves, or shiny body surfaces. Work on different species suggests that these behaviors are not mediated by the ""Dorsal Rim Area"" (DRA), a specialized region in the dorsal periphery of the adult compound eye, where ommatidia contain highly polarization-sensitive photoreceptor cells whose receptive fields point towards the sky. So far, only few cases of polarization-sensitive photoreceptors have been described in the ventral periphery of the insect retina. Furthermore, both the structure and function of those neural circuits connecting to these photoreceptor inputs remain largely uncharacterized. Here we review the known data on non-celestial polarization vision from different insect species (dragonflies, butterflies, beetles, bugs and flies) and present three well-characterized examples for functionally specialized non-DRA detectors from different insects that seem perfectly suited for mediating such behaviors. Finally, using recent advances from circuit dissection inDrosophila melanogaster, we discuss what types of potential candidate neurons could be involved in forming the underlying neural circuitry mediating non-celestial polarization vision."
"Periodic oscillations of gonadal hormone levels during the estrous cycle exert effects on the female brain, impacting cognition and behavior. While previous research suggests that changes in hormone levels across the cycle affect dendritic spine dynamics in the hippocampus, little is known about the effects on cortical dendritic spines and previous studies showed contradictory results. In thisin vivoimaging study, we investigated the impact of the estrous cycle on the density and dynamics of dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex of mice. We also examined if the induction of synaptic plasticity during proestrus, estrus, and metestrus/diestrus had differential effects on the degree of remodeling of synapses in this brain area. We used chronic two-photon excitation (2PE) microscopy during steady-state conditions and after evoking synaptic plasticity by whisker stimulation at the different stages of the cycle. We imaged apical dendritic tufts of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of naturally cycling virgin young female mice. Spine density, turnover rate (TOR), survival fraction, morphology, and volume of mushroom spines remained unaltered across the estrous cycle, and the values of these parameters were comparable with those of young male mice. However, while whisker stimulation of female mice during proestrus and estrus resulted in increases in the TOR of spines (74.2 ± 14.9% and 75.1 ± 12.7% vs. baseline, respectively), sensory-evoked plasticity was significantly lower during metestrus/diestrus (32.3 ± 12.8%). In males, whisker stimulation produced 46.5 ± 20% increase in TOR compared with baseline-not significantly different from female mice at any stage of the cycle. These results indicate that, while steady-state density and dynamics of dendritic spines of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex of female mice are constant during the estrous cycle, the susceptibility of these neurons to sensory-evoked structural plasticity may be dependent on the stage of the cycle. Since dendritic spines are more plastic during proestrus and estrus than during metestrus/diestrus, certain stages of the cycle could be more suitable for forms of memory requiringde novoformation and elimination of spines and other stages for forms of memory where retention and/or repurposing of already existing synaptic connections is more pertinent."
"The A2Aadenosine receptor (A2AR) and D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) are two G-protein-coupled receptors that can form dimers and negatively regulate their partners. TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) is a nuclear protein that has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mislocalization of TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is an early step of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Our previous studies indicated that A2AR is a potential drug target for ALS because treatment with an A2AR agonist (JMF1907; a T1-11 analog) prevents reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced TDP-43 mislocalization in a motor neuron cell line (NSC34) and delays motor impairment in a TDP-43 transgenic ALS mouse model. Here, we set out to assess whether activation of D2R interferes with the beneficial effects of an A2AR agonist on motor neurons. We first demonstrated that A2AR and D2R are both located in motor neurons of mouse and human spinal cords and human iPSC-derived motor neurons. Expression of A2AR and D2R in NSC34 cells led to dimer formation without affecting the binding affinity of A2AR toward T1-11. Importantly, activation of D2R reduced T1-11-mediated activation of cAMP/PKA signaling and subsequent inhibition of TDP-43 mislocalization in NSC34 cells. Treatment with quinpirole (a D2agonist) blunted the rescuing effect of T1-11 on TDP-43 mislocalization and impaired grip strength in a mouse model of ALS. Our findings suggest that D2R activation may limit the beneficial responses of an A2AR agonist in motor neurons and may have an important role in ALS pathogenesis."
"We studied group-I metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors in Pahenu2(ENU2) mice, which mimic the genetics and neurobiology of human phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder characterized, if untreated, by autism, and intellectual disability (ID). Male ENU2 mice showed increased mGlu5 receptor protein levels in the hippocampus and corpus striatum (but not in the prefrontal cortex) whereas the transcript of the mGlu5 receptor was unchanged. No changes in mGlu1 receptor mRNA and protein levels were found in any of the three brain regions of ENU2 mice. We extended the analysis to Homer proteins, which act as scaffolds by linking mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors to effector proteins. Expression of the long isoforms of Homer was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of ENU2 mice, whereas levels of the short Homer isoform (Homer 1a) were unchanged. mGlu5 receptors were less associated to immunoprecipitated Homer in the hippocampus of ENU2 mice. The lack of mGlu5 receptor-mediated long-term depression (LTD) in wild-type mice (of BTBR strain) precluded the analysis of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in ENU2 mice. We therefore performed a behavioral analysis to examine whether pharmacological blockade of mGlu5 receptors could correct behavioral abnormalities in ENU2 mice. Using the same apparatus we sequentially assessed locomotor activity, object exploration, and spatial object recognition (spatial novelty test) after displacing some of the objects from their original position in the arena. Systemic treatment with the mGlu5 receptor antagonist, MPEP (20 mg/kg, i.p.), had a striking effect in the spatial novelty test by substantially increasing the time spent in exploring the displaced objects in ENU2 mice (but not in wild-type mice). These suggest a role for mGlu5 receptors in the pathophysiology of ID in PKU and suggest that, also in adult untreated animals, cognitive dysfunction may be improved by targeting these receptors with an appropriate therapy."
"Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are used to help smoking cessation. However, these devices contain harmful chemicals, and there are safety concerns. We have investigated the effects of e-cigs on the inflammatory response and viability of COPD bronchial epithelial cells (BECs).BECs from COPD patients and controls were exposed to e-cig vapor extract (ECVE) and the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, C-X-C motif ligand 8 (CXCL8), and lactate dehydrogenase release were measured. We also examined the effect of ECVE pretreatment on polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)-stimulated cytokine release from BECs. Parallel experiments using Calu-3 cells were performed. Comparisons were made with cigarette smoke extract (CSE).ECVE and CSE caused an increase in the release of IL-6 and CXCL8 from Calu-3 cells. ECVE only caused toxicity in BECs and Calu-3 cells. Furthermore, ECVE and CSE dampened poly I:C-stimulated C-X-C motif ligand 10 release from both cell culture models, reaching statistical significance for CSE at an optical density of 0.3.ECVE caused toxicity and reduced the antiviral response to poly I:C. This raises concerns over the safety of e-cig use."
"Histomorphometry and Micro-CT are commonly used to assess bone remodeling and bone microarchitecture. These approaches typically require separate cohorts of animals to analyze 3D morphological changes and involve time-consuming immunohistochemistry preparation. Intravital Microscopy (IVM) in combination with mouse genetics may represent an attractive option to obtain bone architectural measurements while performing longitudinal monitoring of dynamic cellular processes in vivo. In this study we utilized two-photon, multicolor fluorescence IVM together with a lineage tracing reporter mouse model to image skeletal stem cells (SSCs) in their calvarial suture niche and analyze their differentiation fate after stimulation with an agonist of the canonical Wnt pathway (recombinant Wnt3a). Our in vivo histomorphometry analyses of bone formation, suture volume, and cellular dynamics showed that recombinant Wnt3a induces new bone formation, differentiation and incorporation of SSCs progeny into newly forming bone. IVM technology can therefore provide additional dynamic 3D information to the traditional static 2D histomorphometry."
"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with dismal response warranting the need for enhancing our understanding of AML biology. One prognostic feature associated with inferior response is the presence of activating mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) especially occurrence of internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD). Although poorly understood, differential metabolic and signaling pathways associated with FLT3-ITD might contribute towards the observed poor prognosis. We performed a non-targeted global metabolic profiling of matched cell and plasma samples obtained at diagnosis to establish metabolic differences within FLT3-ITD and FLT3-WT pediatric AML. Metabolomic profiling by Ultra-High Performance-Liquid-Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry identified differential abundance of 21 known metabolites in plasma and 33 known metabolites in leukemic cells by FLT3 status. These metabolic features mapped to pathways of significant biological importance. Of interest were metabolites with roles in cancer, cell progression and involvement in purine metabolism and biosynthesis, cysteine/methionine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, carnitine mediated fatty acid oxidation, and lysophospholipid metabolism. Although validation in a larger cohort is required, our results for the first time investigated global metabolic profile in FLT3-ITD AML."
"Seed vigor, an important index of seed quality, determines the potential for rapid and uniform emergence of plants. The objective of this study was to explore a rapid method for evaluating seed vigor. To analyze the correlation of seed traits and seedling traits related to seed vigor, we designed five experiments including nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation and seed sorting treatments in wheat. The results showed that only the absolute content of protein (ACP) in wheat seed was significantly correlated with plant dry weight in five experiments. Subsequently, another experiment including 30 wheat seed lots was used to validate the above results. Although 100-grain weight was also correlated with plant dry weight (R?=?0.799, p?<?0.01), the correlation coefficient was lower than that between ACP in seed and plant dry weight (R?=?0.897, p?<?0.01). Moreover, the results of three experiments using maize seeds was similar with above. The relative content of protein in seed detected by near-infrared spectrum combining with seed weight could realize rapid and nondestructive testing ACP in seed. Collectively, ACP in crop seed could be applied in rapid evaluation of seed vigor and could potentially be used for processing and screening high vigor seeds."
"After its recent rediscovery, the Hula painted frog (Latonia nigriventer) has remained one of the world's rarest and least understood amphibian species. Together with its apparently low dispersal capability and highly disturbed niche, the low abundance of this living fossil calls for urgent conservation measures. We used 18 newly developed microsatellite loci and four different models to calculate the effective population size (Ne) of a total of 125 Hula painted frog individuals sampled at a single location. We compare the Neestimates to the estimates of potentially reproducing adults in this population (Nad) determined through a capture-recapture study on 118 adult Hula painted frogs captured at the same site. Surprisingly, our data suggests that, despite Nadestimates of only ~234-244 and Neestimates of ~16.6-35.8, the species appears to maintain a very high genetic diversity (HO?=?0.771) and low inbreeding coefficient (FIS?=?-0.018). This puzzling outcome could perhaps be explained by the hypotheses of either genetic rescue from one or more unknown Hula painted frog populations nearby or by recent admixture of genetically divergent subpopulations. Independent of which scenario is correct, the original locations of these populations still remain to be determined."
"Coastal sediments and continental shelves play a crucial role in global biogeochemistry, as they form the prime site of organic carbon burial. Bottom trawling and dredging are known to increasingly impact the coastal seafloor through relocation and homogenisation of sediments, yet little is known about the effects of such anthropogenic sediment reworking on the overall cycling of carbon and other elements within the coastal seafloor. Here, we document the transient recovery of the seafloor biogeochemistry after an in situ disturbance. Evidence from pore-water data and model simulations reveal a short-term increase in the overall carbon mineralisation rate, as well as a longer-term shift in the redox pathways of organic matter mineralisation, favouring organoclastic sulphate reduction over methane formation. This data suggests that anthropogenic sediment reworking could have a sizeable impact on the carbon cycle in cohesive sediments on continental shelves. This imprint will increase in the near future, along with the growing economic exploitation of the coastal ocean."
"microRNAs (miRNAs) have a key role in regulating inflammation, vascular health and in turn, cardiovascular disease. Specifically, altered circulating expression of miR-17, miR-21, miR-34a, miR-92a, miR-126, miR-145, miR-146a, and miR-150 has been linked with the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to determine whether the circulating profile of these vascular-related miRNAs is disrupted with hypertension. Thirty sedentary, middle-aged adults were studied: 15 normotensive (10M/5F; age: 56?±?1?year; BP: 113/71?±?2/1?mmHg) and 15 hypertensive (10M/5F; 56?±?2?year; 140/87?±?2/2?mmHg). All subjects were non-obese and free of other cardiometabolic disorders. Circulating miRNAs were determined in plasma using standard RT-PCR techniques with miRNA primers of interest. Expression was normalized to exogenous C. elegans miR-39 and reported as relative expression in arbitrary units (AU). Circulating expression of miR-34a (9.18?±?0.94 vs 5.33?±?0.91?AU) was higher (~170%; P?<?0.01) whereas the expression of miR-21 (1.32?±?0.25 vs 2.50?±?0.29?AU), miR-126 (0.85?±?0.10 vs 1.74?±?0.27?AU) and miR-146a (1.50?±?0.20 vs 3.10?±?0.50?AU) were markedly lower (~50%, ~55%, and ~55% respectively; P?<?0.05) in the hypertensive vs normotensive groups. Moreover, circulating levels of miR-34a, miR-21, and miR-126 were significantly related to systolic blood pressure (r?=?0.48, r?=?-0.38; r?=?-0.48); whereas, miR-146a was significantly related to both systolic (r?=?-0.58) and diastolic (r?=?-0.55) blood pressure. There were no significant group differences in circulating miR-17, miR-92a, miR-145, and miR-150. In summary, these results suggest that hypertension, independent of other cardiometabolic risk factors, adversely affects the circulating profile of a subset of vascular-related miRNAs that have been link to CVD risk and development."
"Alterations in both cell metabolism and transcriptional programs are hallmarks of cancer that sustain rapid proliferation and metastasis1. However, the mechanisms that control the interaction between metabolic reprogramming and transcriptional regulation remain unclear. Here we show that the metabolic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4) regulates transcriptional reprogramming by activating the oncogenic steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3). We used a kinome-wide RNA interference-based screening method to identify potential kinases that modulate the intrinsic SRC-3 transcriptional response. PFKFB4, a regulatory enzyme that synthesizes a potent stimulator of glycolysis2, is found to be a robust stimulator of SRC-3 that coregulates oestrogen receptor. PFKFB4 phosphorylates SRC-3 at serine 857 and enhances its transcriptional activity, whereas either suppression of PFKFB4 or ectopic expression of a phosphorylation-deficient Ser857Ala mutant SRC-3 abolishes the SRC-3-mediated transcriptional output. Functionally, PFKFB4-driven SRC-3 activation drives glucose flux towards the pentose phosphate pathway and enables purine synthesis by transcriptionally upregulating the expression of the enzyme transketolase. In addition, the two enzymes adenosine monophosphate deaminase-1 (AMPD1) and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), which are involved in purine metabolism, were identified as SRC-3 targets that may or may not be directly involved in purine synthesis. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of SRC-3 at Ser857 increases its interaction with the transcription factor ATF4 by stabilizing the recruitment of SRC-3 and ATF4 to target gene promoters. Ablation of SRC-3 or PFKFB4 suppresses breast tumour growth in mice and prevents metastasis to the lung from an orthotopic setting, as does Ser857Ala-mutant SRC-3. PFKFB4 and phosphorylated SRC-3 levels are increased and correlate in oestrogen receptor-positive tumours, whereas, in patients with the basal subtype, PFKFB4 and SRC-3 drive a common protein signature that correlates with the poor survival of patients with breast cancer. These findings suggest that the Warburg pathway enzyme PFKFB4 acts as a molecular fulcrum that couples sugar metabolism to transcriptional activation by stimulating SRC-3 to promote aggressive metastatic tumours."
"The ability of the human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum to adapt to environmental changes depends considerably on its ability to maintain within-population genetic variation. Strong selection, consequent to widespread antimalarial drug usage, occasionally elicits a rapid expansion of drug-resistant isolates, which can act as founders. To investigate whether this phenomenon induces a loss of within-population genetic variation, we performed a population genetic analysis on 302?P. falciparum cases detected during two cross-sectional surveys in 2002/2003, just after the official introduction of sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine as a first-line treatment, and again in 2010/2011, in highly endemic areas in Papua New Guinea. We found that a single-origin sulphadoxine-resistant parasite isolate rapidly increased from 0% in 2002/2003 to 54% in 2010 and 84% in 2011. However, a considerable number of pairs exhibited random associations among 10 neutral microsatellite markers located in various chromosomes, suggesting that outcrossing effectively reduced non-random associations, albeit at a low average multiplicity of infection (1.35-1.52). Within-population genetic diversity was maintained throughout the study period. This indicates that the parasites maintained within-population variation, even after a clonal expansion of drug-resistant parasites. Outcrossing played a role in the preservation of within-population genetic diversity despite low levels of multiplicity of infection."
"S100? protein and SOX2-double positive (S100?/SOX2-positive) cells have been suggested to be adult pituitary stem/progenitor cells exhibiting plasticity and multipotency. The aim of the present study was to isolate S100?/SOX2-positive cells from the adult anterior lobes of rats using a specific antibody against a novel membrane marker and to study their characteristics in vitro. We found that cluster of differentiation (CD) 9 is expressed in the majority of adult rat S100?/SOX2-positive cells, and we succeeded in isolating CD9-positive cells using an anti-CD9 antibody with a pluriBead-cascade cell isolation system. Cultivation of these cells showed their capacity to differentiate into endothelial cells via bone morphogenetic protein signalling. By using the anterior lobes of prolactinoma model rats, the localisation of CD9-positive cells was confirmed in the tumour-induced neovascularisation region. Thus, the present study provides novel insights into adult pituitary stem/progenitor cells involved in the vascularisation of the anterior lobe."
"Tunicates are marine invertebrates that compose the closest phylogenetic group to the vertebrates. These chordates present a particularly diverse range of regenerative abilities and life-history strategies. Consequently, tunicates provide an extraordinary perspective into the emergence and diversity of these traits. Here we describe the genome sequencing, annotation and analysis of the Stolidobranchian Botrylloides leachii. We have produced a high-quality 159?Mb assembly, 82% of the predicted 194?Mb genome. Analysing genome size, gene number, repetitive elements, orthologs clustering and gene ontology terms show that B. leachii has a genomic architecture similar to that of most solitary tunicates, while other recently sequenced colonial ascidians have undergone genome expansion. In addition, ortholog clustering has identified groups of candidate genes for the study of colonialism and whole-body regeneration. By analysing the structure and composition of conserved gene linkages, we observed examples of cluster breaks and gene dispersions, suggesting that several lineage-specific genome rearrangements occurred during tunicate evolution. We also found lineage-specific gene gain and loss within conserved cell-signalling pathways. Such examples of genetic changes within conserved cell-signalling pathways commonly associated with regeneration and development that may underlie some of the diverse regenerative abilities observed in tunicates. Overall, these results provide a novel resource for the study of tunicates and of colonial ascidians."
"The development of environmentally friendly plant protection products (PPPs), including pesticides, is a challenge nowadays. A commercial herbicide combining terbuthylazine and nicosulfuron as active substances (a.s.) was selected as a model PPP. The suitability of manipulating the ratio between a.s. towards alternative formulations with reduced impacts in a non-target indicator (Lemna minor) was assessed. The efficacy of such eco-friendlier a.s. ratios was then assessed using a target weed, Portulaca oleracea. Single and mixture toxicity testing with L. minor revealed an antagonistic joint action of the a.s., suggesting an environmentally protective effect of the combination compared to single dosing of a.s. The efficacy testing against the target weed of single and combined treatments of the a.s. showed that (i) the a.s. behave antagonistically throughout the whole P. oleracea response surface; (ii) there were no environmentally safe a.s. combinations ensuring target-efficacy; (iii) terbuthylazine alone was effective in controlling P. oleracea with no environmental hazardous potential, dosed at concentrations 10-fold lower than those involved in commercially recommended application doses. Overall, this case-study suggests that modelling tools widely used in the field of environmental risk assessment of PPPs may also have application in PPP design stages for a more efficient meeting of efficacy and environmental friendliness requirements."
"Cancer cells contain a unique set of cell surface receptors that provide potential targets for tumor theranostics. Here, we propose an efficient approach to construct G-quadruplex-based aptamers that specifically recognize cell-surface receptors and monitor them in an amplified manner. This designed aptamer combined particular sequence for the c-Met on the cell surface and poly-G-quadruplexes structures that allow a rapid and amplified fluorescent readout upon the binding of thioflavin T (ThT). The poly-G-quadruplexes also function as a carrier for photosensitizers such as TMPyP4 in that, the aptamer further trigger the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to commit cells to death. This unique c-Met targeting aptamer enabled simultaneous monitoring of c-Met on the cell surface with ThT and photodynamic killing of these lung cancer cells with TMPyP4. This strategy is expected to enhance the development of tumor-targeted diagnosis and drug delivery."
"Aggregation of alpha synuclein has strong implications in Parkinson's disease. The heterogeneity of folding/aggregation landscape and transient nature of the early intermediates result in difficulty in developing a successful therapeutic intervention. Here we used fluorescence measurements at ensemble and single molecule resolution to study how the late and early events of alpha synuclein aggregation modulate each other. In-vitro aggregation data was complemented using measurements inside live neuroblastoma cells by employing a small molecule labeling technique. An inhibitor molecule (arginine), which delayed the late event of amyloidosis, was found to bind to the protein, shifting the early conformational fluctuations towards a compact state. In contrast, a facilitator of late aggregation (glutamate), was found to be excluded from the protein surface. The presence of glutamate was found to speed up the oligomer formation at the early stage. We found that the effects of the inhibitor and facilitator were additive and as a result they maintained a ratio at which they cancelled each other's influence on different stages of alpha synuclein aggregation."
"Muscle atrophy is one of the main characteristics of human ageing and physical inactivity, with resulting adverse health outcomes. To date, there are still no efficient therapeutic strategies for its prevention and/or treatment. However, during hibernation, bears exhibit a unique ability for preserving muscle in conditions where muscle atrophy would be expected in humans. Therefore, our objective was to determine whether there are components of bear serum which can control protein balance in human muscles. In this study, we exposed cultured human differentiated muscle cells to bear serum collected during winter and summer periods, and measured the impact on cell protein content and turnover. In addition, we explored the signalling pathways that control rates of protein synthesis and degradation. We show that the protein turnover of human myotubes is reduced when incubated with winter bear serum, with a dramatic inhibition of proteolysis involving both proteasomal and lysosomal systems, and resulting in an increase in muscle cell protein content. By modulating intracellular signalling pathways and inducing a protein sparing phenotype in human muscle cells, winter bear serum therefore holds potential for developing new tools to fight human muscle atrophy and related metabolic disorders."
"Zika virus is a teratogenic mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that is associated with birth defects in newborns and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. The virus can also be sexually transmitted, but currently, very little is known about the cell types supporting virus replication and persistence in human testes. Using primary cell cultures, we observed that Sertoli but not Leydig cells are highly susceptible to Zika virus infection, a process that is dependent on the TAM family receptor Axl. In cell culture, Sertoli cells could be productively infected with Zika virus for at least 6-weeks. Infection of Sertoli cells resulted in dramatic changes to the transcriptional profile of these cells. The most upregulated mRNA in infected cells was basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), a cytokine that was found to enhance Zika virus replication and support viral persistence. Together these findings provide key insights into understanding how Zika virus persists in the male reproductive tract and in turn may aid in developing antiviral therapies or strategies to minimize sexual transmission of this pathogen."
"Rubisco is an ancient, catalytically conserved yet slow enzyme, which plays a central role in the biosphere's carbon cycle. The design of Rubiscos to increase agricultural productivity has hitherto relied on the use of in vivo selection systems, precluding the exploration of biochemical traits that are not wired to cell survival. We present a directed -in vitro- evolution platform that extracts the enzyme from its biological context to provide a new avenue for Rubisco engineering. Precambrian and extant form II Rubiscos were subjected to an ensemble of directed evolution strategies aimed at improving thermostability. The most recent ancestor of proteobacteria -dating back 2.4 billion years- was uniquely tolerant to mutagenic loading. Adaptive evolution, focused evolution and genetic drift revealed a panel of thermostable mutants, some deviating from the characteristic trade-offs in CO2-fixing speed and specificity. Our findings provide a novel approach for identifying Rubisco variants with improved catalytic evolution potential."
"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) mediates the degradation of L-tryptophan (L-Trp) and is constitutively expressed in the chorionic vascular endothelium of the human placenta with highest levels in the microvasculature. Given that endothelial expression of IDO1 has been shown to regulate vascular tone and blood pressure in mice under the condition of systemic inflammation, we asked whether IDO1 is also involved in the regulation of placental blood flow and if yes, whether this function is potentially impaired in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and pre-eclampsia (PE). In the large arteries of the chorionic plate L-Trp induced relaxation only after upregulation of IDO1 using interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha. However, ex vivo placental perfusion of pre-constricted cotyledonic vasculature with L-Trp decreases the vessel back pressure without prior IDO1 induction. Further to this finding, IDO1 protein expression and activity is reduced in IUGR and PE when compared to gestational age-matched control tissue. These data suggest that L-Trp catabolism plays a role in the regulation of placental vascular tone, a finding which is potentially linked to placental and fetal growth. In this context our data suggest that IDO1 deficiency is related to the pathogenesis of IUGR and PE."
"Due to the highly invasive nature of Glioblastoma (GB), complete surgical resection is not feasible, while motile tumour cells are often associated with several specific brain structures that enhance treatment-resistance. Here, we investigate the therapeutic potential of Disulfiram and Carbenoxolone, that inhibit two distinct interactions between GB and the brain tissue microenvironment: stress-induced cell-matrix adhesion and gap junction mediated cell-cell communication, respectively. Increase in cell numbers of tumour-initiating cells, which are cultured in suspension as cell clusters, and adherent differentiated cells can be blocked to a similar extent by Carbenoxolone, as both cell populations form gap junctions, but the adherent differentiated cells are much more sensitive to Disulfiram treatment, which - via modulation of NF-?B signalling - interferes with cell-substrate adhesion. Interestingly, inducing adhesion in tumour-initiating cells without differentiating them does not sensitize for Disulfiram. Importantly, combining Disulfiram, Carbenoxolone and the standard chemotherapeutic drug Temozolomide reduces tumour size in an orthotopic mouse model. Isolating GB cells from their direct environment within the brain represents an important addition to current therapeutic approaches. The blockage of cellular interactions via the clinically relevant substances Disulfiram and Carbenoxolone, has distinct effects on different cell populations within a tumour, potentially reducing motility and/or resistance to apoptosis."
"Ebolaviruses comprises 5 species that exert varying degrees of mortality/infectivity in humans with Reston ebolaviruses (REBOV) showing the lowest and Zaire ebolaviruses (ZEBOV) showing the highest. However, the molecular basis of this differential mortality/infectivity remains unclear. Here, we report that the structural features of ebolavirus envelope glycoproteins (GPs) and one of their counter receptors, macrophage galactose-type calcium-type lectin (MGL/CD301), play crucial roles in determining viral infectivity. The low infectivity of REBOV mediated by the interaction between GPs and MGL/CD301 dramatically increased when the N-terminal 18 amino acids (33rd through 50th) of GPs were replaced with that of ZEBOV. Furthermore, structural analysis of glycans of GPs revealed that N-glycans were more extended in REBOV than in ZEBOV. N-glycan extension was reversed by the replacement of aforementioned N-terminal 18 amino acid residues. Therefore, these data strongly suggest that extended N-glycans on GPs reduce MGL/CD301-mediated viral infectivity by hindering the interaction between GPs and MGL/CD301 preferentially binds O-glycans."
"Pigment dispersion can lead to pigmentary glaucoma, a poorly understood condition of younger myopic eyes with fluctuating high intraocular pressure. It has been difficult to investigate its pathogenesis without a model similar to human eyes in size and behavior. Here we present a porcine ex vivo model that recreates several features of pigmentary glaucoma, including intraocular hypertension, accumulation of pigment in the trabecular meshwork, and declining phagocytosis. We found that trabecular meshwork cells regulate outflow, form actin stress fibers, and have a decreased phagocytic activity. Gene expression microarrays and a pathway analysis of TM monolayers as well as ex vivo anterior segment perfusion cultures indicated that RhoA plays a central role in regulating the cytoskeleton, motility, and phagocytosis in the trabecular meshwork, providing new insights and targets to investigate in pigmentary glaucoma."
"The most common allergen in fish, the highly-abundant protein ?-parvalbumin, forms amyloid structures as a way to avoid gastrointestinal degradation and transit to the blood. In humans, the same amyloid structures are mostly associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. We here assessed a putative connection between these amyloids using recombinant Atlantic cod ?-parvalbumin and the key amyloidogenic protein in Parkinson's disease, ?-synuclein. Using a set of in vitro biophysical methods, we discovered that ?-parvalbumin readily inhibits amyloid formation of ?-synuclein. The underlying mechanism was found to involve ?-synuclein binding to the surface of ?-parvalbumin amyloid fibers. In addition to being a new amyloid inhibition mechanism, the data suggest that health benefits of fish may be explained in part by cross-reaction of ?-parvalbumin with human amyloidogenic proteins."
"Bone is a frequent site of metastasis from breast cancer. To understand the potential role of osteocytes in bone metastasis, we investigated tumor-osteocyte interactions using two cell lines derived from the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, primary breast cancer cells, and MLO-A5/MLO-Y4 osteocyte cells. When three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids were grown with osteocyte spheroids, tumor spheroids fused with osteocyte spheroids and shrank. This size reduction was also observed when tumor spheroids were exposed to conditioned medium isolated from osteocyte cells. Mass spectrometry-based analysis predicted that several bone matrix proteins (e.g., collagen, biglycan) in conditioned medium could be responsible for tumor shrinkage. The osteocyte-driven shrinkage was mimicked by type I collagen, the most abundant organic component in bone, but not by hydroxyapatite, a major inorganic component in bone. RNA and protein expression analysis revealed that tumor-osteocyte interactions downregulated Snail, a transcription factor involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). An agarose bead assay showed that bone matrix proteins act as a tumor attractant. Collectively, the study herein demonstrates that osteocytes attract and compact migratory breast cancer cells through bone matrix proteins, suppress tumor migration, by Snail downregulation, and promote subsequent metastatic colonization."
"Only two reports exist on drug-resistance of quaternary ammonium monomers against oral bacteria; both studies tested planktonic bacteria for 10 passages, and neither study tested biofilms or resins. The objectives of this study were to investigate the drug-resistance of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii against dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM), and to evaluate biofilms on resins with repeated exposures for 20 passages for the first time. DMAHDM, dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (DMADDM) and chlorhexidine (CHX) were tested with planktonic bacteria. Biofilms were grown on a resin containing 3% DMAHDM. Minimum-inhibitory concentrations were measured. To detect drug-resistance, the survived bacteria from the previous passage were used as inoculum for the next passage for repeated exposures. S. gordonii developed drug-resistance against DMADDM and CHX, but not against DMAHDM. Biofilm colony-forming units (CFU) on DMAHDM-resin was reduced by 3-4?log; there was no difference from passages 1 to 20 (p?>?0.1). No drug-resistance to DMAHDM was detected for all three bacterial species. In conclusion, this study showed that DMAHDM induced no drug-resistance, and DMAHDM-resin reduced biofilm CFU by 3-4?log, with no significant change from 1 to 20 passages. DMAHDM with potent antibacterial activities and no drug-resistance is promising for dental applications."
"With continuing advances in the resolving power of super-resolution microscopy, the inefficient labeling of proteins with suitable fluorophores becomes a limiting factor. For example, the low labeling density achieved with antibodies or small molecule tags limits attempts to reveal local protein nano-architecture of cellular compartments. On the other hand, high laser intensities cause photobleaching within and nearby an imaged region, thereby further reducing labeling density and impairing multi-plane whole-cell 3D super-resolution imaging. Here, we show that both labeling density and photobleaching can be addressed by repetitive application of trisNTA-fluorophore conjugates reversibly binding to a histidine-tagged protein by a novel approach called single-epitope repetitive imaging (SERI). For single-plane super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that, after multiple rounds of labeling and imaging, the signal density is increased. Using the same approach of repetitive imaging, washing and re-labeling, we demonstrate whole-cell 3D super-resolution imaging compensated for photobleaching above or below the imaging plane. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that repetitive labeling of histidine-tagged proteins provides a versatile solution to break the 'labeling barrier' and to bypass photobleaching in multi-plane, whole-cell 3D experiments."
"Migration is a key process in the population dynamics of numerous insect species, including many that are pests or vectors of disease. Identification of insect migrants is critically important to studies of insect migration. Radar is an effective means of monitoring nocturnal insect migrants. However, species identification of migrating insects is often unachievable with current radar technology. Special-purpose entomological radar can measure radar cross-sections (RCSs) from which the insect mass, wingbeat frequency and body length-to-width ratio (a measure of morphological form) can be estimated. These features may be valuable for species identification. This paper explores the identification of insect migrants based on the mass, wingbeat frequency and length-to-width ratio, and body length is also introduced to assess the benefit of adding another variable. A total of 23 species of migratory insects captured by a searchlight trap are used to develop a classification model based on decision-tree support vector machine method. The results reveal that the identification accuracy exceeds 80% for all species if the mass, wingbeat frequency and length-to-width ratio are utilized, and the addition of body length is shown to further increase accuracy. It is also shown that improving the precision of the measurements leads to increased identification accuracy."
"Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is currently the most used biomarker in clinical practice for prostate cancer (PCa) detection. However, this biomarker has several drawbacks. In this work, an untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomic profiling of PCa cells was performed to prove the concept that metabolic alterations might differentiate PCa cell lines from normal prostate cell line. For that, we assessed the differences in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) profile in the extracellular medium (exometabolome) of four PCa cell lines and one normal prostate cell line at two pH values (pH 2 and 7) by GC-MS. Multivariate analysis revealed a panel of volatile metabolites that discriminated cancerous from normal prostate cells. The most altered metabolites included ketones, aldehydes and organic acids. Among these, we highlight pentadecane-2-one and decanoic acid, which were significantly increased in PCa compared to normal cells, and cyclohexanone, 4-methylheptan-2-one, 2-methylpentane-1,3-diol, 4-methylbenzaldehyde, 1-(3,5-dimethylfuran-2-yl)ethanone, methyl benzoate and nonanoic acid, which were significantly decreased in PCa cells. The PCa volatilome was markedly influenced by the VOCs extraction pH, though the discriminant capability was similar. Overall, our data suggest that VOCs monitoring has the potential to be used as a PCa screening methodology."
"Cyclophilin 1 (TvCyP1), a cyclophilin type peptidyl-prolyl isomerase present in the human parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, interacts with Myb1 and assists in its nuclear translocation. Myb1 regulates the expression of ap65-1 gene that encodes for a disease causing cytoadherence enzyme. Here, we determined the crystal structures of TvCyP1 and its complex with the minimum TvCyP1-binding sequence of Myb1 (Myb1104-111), where TvCyP1 formed a homodimer, unlike other single domain cyclophilins. In the complex structure, one Myb1104-111peptide was bound to each TvCyP1 protomer, with G106-P107 and Y105 fitting well into the active site and auxiliary S2 pocket, respectively. NMR data further showed that TvCyP1 can catalyze the cis/trans isomerization of P107 in Myb1104-111. Interestingly, in the well-folded Myb1 protein (Myb135-141), the minimum binding sequence adopted a different conformation from that of unstructured Myb1104-111peptide, that could make P107 binding to the active site of TvCyP1 difficult. However, NMR studies showed that similar to Myb1104-111peptide, Myb135-141also interacted with the active site of TvCyP1 and the dynamics of the Myb135-141residues near P107 was reduced upon interaction. Together, the structure of TvCyP1 and detailed structural insights on TvCyP1-Myb1 interaction provided here could pave the way for newer drugs to treat drug-resistant strains."
"The molecular mechanisms underlying vascular regeneration and repair are largely unknown. To gain insight into this process, we developed a method of intima denudation, characterized the progression of endothelial healing, and performed transcriptome analysis over time. Next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq) provided a quantitative and unbiased gene expression profile during in vivo regeneration following denudation injury. Our data indicate that shortly after injury, cells immediately adjacent to the wound mount a robust and rapid response with upregulation of genes like Jun, Fos, Myc, as well as cell adhesion genes. This was quickly followed by a wave of proliferative genes. After completion of endothelial healing a vigorous array of extracellular matrix transcripts were upregulated. Gene ontology enrichment and protein network analysis were used to identify transcriptional profiles over time. Further data mining revealed four distinct stages of regeneration: shock, proliferation, acclimation, and maturation. The transcriptional signature of those stages provides insight into the regenerative machinery responsible for arterial repair under normal physiologic conditions."
"Rats are excellent animal models for experimental neuroscience. However, the application of optogenetics in rats has been hindered because of the limited number of established transgenic rat strains. To accomplish cell-type specific targeting of an optimized optogenetic molecular tool, we generated ROSA26/CAG-floxed STOP-ChRFR(C167A)-Venus BAC rats that conditionally express the step-function mutant channelrhodopsin ChRFR(C167A) under the control of extrinsic Cre recombinase. In primary cultured cortical neurons derived from this reporter rat, only Cre-positive cells expressing ChRFR(C167A) became bi-stable, that is, their excitability was enhanced by blue light and returned to the baseline by yellow~red light. In bigenic pups carrying the Phox2B-Cre driver, ChRFR(C167A) was specifically expressed in the rostral parafacial respiratory group (pFRG) in the medulla, where endogenous Phox2b immunoreactivity was detected. These neurons were sensitive to blue light with an increase in the firing frequency. Thus, this transgenic rat actuator/reporter system should facilitate optogenetic studies involving the effective in vivo manipulation of the activities of specific cell fractions using light of minimal intensity."
"Caged xanthones are bioactive compounds mainly derived from the Garcinia genus. In this study, a structure-activity relationship (SAR) of caged xanthones and their derivatives for anticancer activity against different cancer cell lines such as A549, HepG2 and U251 were developed through quantitative (Q)-SAR modeling approach. The regression coefficient (r2), internal cross-validation regression coefficient (q2) and external cross-validation regression coefficient (pred_r2) of derived QSAR models were 0.87, 0.81 and 0.82, for A549, whereas, 0.87, 0.84 and 0.90, for HepG2, and 0.86, 0.83 and 0.83, for U251 respectively. These models were used to design and screened the potential caged xanthone derivatives. Further, the compounds were filtered through the rule of five, ADMET-risk and synthetic accessibility. Filtered compounds were then docked to identify the possible target binding pocket, to obtain a set of aligned ligand poses and to prioritize the predicted active compounds. The scrutinized compounds, as well as their metabolites, were evaluated for different pharmacokinetics parameters such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity. Finally, the top hit compound 1G was analyzed by system pharmacology approaches such as gene ontology, metabolic networks, process networks, drug target network, signaling pathway maps as well as identification of off-target proteins that may cause adverse reactions."
"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive cardiovascular-disease with high mortality lacking high-efficiency drug. Our efforts attempted to delineate therapeutic action of osthole produced by Angelica Pubescens Maxim, which has the capacity to treat PAH by exploiting an iTRAQ-based proteomic method. Excitingly, osthole was observed to significantly restore 98 of 315 differential proteins significantly modified by PAH progression. They were primarily annotated into 24 signaling pathways. Four mostly affected proteins (RPL15, Cathepsin S, Histone H3.3 and HMGB1) were experimentially validated which belonged to ribosome pathway, oxidative phosphorylation pathway, systemic lupus erythematosus pathway, complement and coagulation cascades pathway, whose modifications and modulations mostly accounted for therapeutic capacity of this compound against PAH. Altogether, our findings demonstrated that global proteomics is a promising systems-biology approach for deciphering therapeutic actions and associated mechanisms of natural products derived from traditional Chinese medicine. Importantly, osthole is supposed to be a candidate compound for new drug development to treat PAH."
"Pathogenic fungi including Penicillium digitatum and Penicillium italicum are the main destructive pathogens in the citrus industry, causing great losses during postharvest process. To our knowledge, only one mycovirus from P. digitatum has been reported, and the prevalence of such mycoviruses against citrus postharvest pathogenic fungi and their genotyping were still under investigation. In the present study, we showed that 39 of 152 Penicillium isolates from main citrus-growing areas in China were infected with various mycoviruses belonging to polymycoviruses, Narna-like viruses, and families Totiviridae, Partitivirdae and Chrysoviridae. The next generation sequencing (NGS) towards virus genome library and the following molecular analysis revealed two novel mycoviruses Penicillium digitatum polymycovirus 1 (PdPmV1) and Penicillium digitatum Narna-like virus 1 (PdNLV1), coexisting in P. digitatum strain HS-RH2. The fungicide-resistant P. digitatum strains HS-F6 and HS-E9 coinfected by PdPmV1 and PdNLV1 exhibited obvious reduction in triazole drug prochloraz resistance by mycelial growth analysis on both PDA plates and citrus fruit epidermis with given prochloraz concentration. This report at the first time characterized two novel mycoviruses from P. digitatum and revealed the mycovirus-induced reduction of fungicide resistance."
"Methylglyoxal(MG) is a potent cytotoxin that is produced as a byproduct of various metabolic reactions in the cell. The major enzymes for MG detoxification are Glyoxalase I(GLYI), Glyoxalase II(GLYII) and D-lactate dehydrogenase(D-LDH). These three enzymes work together and convert MG into D-pyruvate, which directly goes to TCA cycle. Here, a comparative study of the ability of MG detoxification of these three enzymes has been done in both E. coli and yeast. Ectopic expression of these three genes from Arabidopsis in E. coli in presence of different abiotic stress revealed the contribution of each of these genes in detoxifying MG. Yeast mutants of MG detoxification enzymes were also grown in different stress conditions to record the effect of each gene. These mutants were also used for complementation assays using the respective MG detoxifying genes from Arabidopsis in presence of various stress conditions. The MG content and the corresponding growth of cells was measured in all the bacterial as well as yeast strains. This study reveals differential contribution of MG detoxification enzymes in mitigating MG levels and alleviating stress in both prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes. GLYI and D-LDH were found to be key enzymes in MG detoxification under various abiotic stresses."
"Malaria outbreaks have been reported in recent years in the Colombian Amazon region, malaria has been re-emerging in areas where it was previously controlled. Information from malaria transmission networks and knowledge about the population characteristics influencing the dispersal of parasite species is limited. This study aimed to determine the distribution patterns of Plasmodium vivax, P. malariae and P. falciparum single and mixed infections, as well as the significant socio-spatial groupings relating to the appearance of such infections. An active search in 57 localities resulted in 2,106 symptomatic patients being enrolled. Parasitaemia levels were assessed by optical microscopy, and parasites were detected by PCR. The association between mixed infections (in 43.2% of the population) and socio-spatial factors was modelled using logistic regression and multiple correspondence analyses. P. vivax occurred most frequently (71.0%), followed by P. malariae (43.2%), in all localities. The results suggest that a parasite density-dependent regulation model (with fever playing a central role) was appropriate for modelling the frequency of mixed species infections in this population. This study highlights the under-reporting of Plasmodium spp. mixed infections in the malaria-endemic area of the Colombian Amazon region and the association between causative and environmental factors in such areas."
"The study of organic/inorganic molecules with activity against intracellular fungi of the phylum Microsporidia is of critical importance. Here, for the first time, the inactivation of these parasitic fungi by porphyrins is reported. The biological effects of porphyrins (10?µM and 100?µM) on the microsporidian Nosema ceranae was investigated in honeybee hosts using cage experiments. A significant reduction in the number of spores (from 2.6 to 5 fold) was observed in Nosema-infected honeybees with a sucrose-protoporphyrin amide [PP(Asp)2] syrup diet compared to the control honeybees. PP(Asp)2and the other porphyrin examined in vitro, TMePyP, had a direct impact on the microsporidia. Notably, neither porphyrin requires light excitation to be active against microsporidia. Moreover, microsporidia preincubated with these porphyrins exhibited decreased ability to infect honeybees. In particular, PP(Asp)2, possessing amphiphilic characteristics, exhibited significant inactivation of microsporidia, preventing the development of the microsporidia and diminishing the mortality of infected honeybees. In addition, the porphyrin-treated spores examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed morphological changes in their exosporium layers, which were distinctly deformed. Thus, we postulate that the mechanism of action of porphyrins on microsporidia is not based on photodynamic inactivation but on the destruction of the cell walls of the spores."
"Although vibrational signalling is among the most ancient and common forms of communication, many fundamental aspects of this communication channel are still poorly understood. Here, we studied mechanisms underlying orientation towards the source of vibrational signals in the stink bug Nezara viridula (Hemiptera, Pentatomidae), where female vibrational song enables male to locate her on the bean plant. At the junction between the main stem and the leaf stalks, male placed his legs on different sides of the branching and orientation at the branching point was not random. Analyses of signal transmission revealed that only a time delay between the arrival of vibrational wave to receptors located in the legs stretched across the branching was a reliable directional cue underlying orientation, since, unexpectedly, the signal amplitude at the branching point was often higher on the stalk away from the female. The plant and the position of the vibrational source on the plant were the most important factors influencing the unpredictability of the amplitude cue. Determined time delays as short as 0.5?ms resulted in marked changes in interneuron activity and the decision model suggests that the behavioural threshold is in the range between 0.3 and 0.5?ms."
"Remodelling of the extracellular matrix is accomplished by altering the balance between matrix macromolecule production and degradation. However, it is not well understood how cells balance production of new matrix molecules and degradation of existing ones during tissue remodelling and regeneration. In this study, we used decellularized lung scaffolds repopulated with allogenic lung fibroblasts cultured with stable isotope labelled amino acids to quantify the balance between matrix production and degradation at a proteome-wide scale. Specific temporal dynamics of different matrisome proteins were found to correspond to the proliferative activity of the repopulating cells and the degree of extracellular deposition. The remodeling of the scaffold was characterized by an initial phase with cell proliferation and high production of cell adhesion proteins such as emilin-1 and fibronectin. Extended culture time resulted in increased levels of core matrisome proteins. In a comparison with monolayer cultures on plastic, culture in lung scaffolds lead to a pronounced accumulation of proteoglycans, such as versican and decorin, resulting in regeneration of an extracellular matrix with greater resemblance to native lung tissue compared to standard monolayer cultures. Collectively, the study presents a promising technique for increasing the understanding of cell- extracellular matrix interactions under healthy and diseased conditions."
"Haemostatic platelet function is intimately linked to cellular mechanics and cytoskeletal morphology. How cytoskeletal reorganizations give rise to a highly contractile phenotype that is necessary for clot contraction remains poorly understood. To elucidate this process in vitro, we developed a morphometric screen to quantify the spatial organization of actin fibres and vinculin adhesion sites in single spread platelets. Platelets from healthy donors predominantly adopted a bipolar morphology on fibrinogen and fibronectin, whereas distinguishable, more isotropic phenotypes on collagen type I or laminin. Specific integrin ?IIb?3inhibitors induced an isotropic cytoskeletal organization in a dose-dependent manner. The same trend was observed with decreasing matrix stiffness. Circular F-actin arrangements in platelets from a patient with type II Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) were consistent with the residual activity of a small number of ?IIb?3integrins. Cytoskeletal morphologies in vitro thus inform about platelet adhesion receptor identity and functionality, and integrin ?IIb?3mechanotransduction fundamentally determines the adoption of a bipolar phenotype associated with contraction. Super-resolution microscopy and electron microscopies further confirmed the stress fibre-like contractile actin architecture. For the first time, our assay allows the unbiased and quantitative assessment of platelet morphologies and could help to identify defective platelet behaviour contributing to elusive bleeding phenotypes."
"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been considered as one of the pivotal type of cells composing the tumor microenvironment. Although contact-dependent mechanisms and paracrine factors are thought to collaborate in governing the MSCs-based effects on tumors progression, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In particular, the involvement of MSCs-derived cytokines in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been clarified. In this study, we observed that ?2-Microglobulin (B2M) is highly expressed in MSCs but scarcely in ESCC cells. Based on the previously described EMT promoting effect of B2M, we investigated the in vitro effect of MSCs-derived B2M on the EMT of ESCC cells, and discovered its subsequent enhancing effects on cell mobility and tumor-initiation. Further xenograft transplantation experiments confirmed the in vivo induction of tumor-initiation by MSCs-derived B2M. Noteworthy, we showed that the B2M expression positively correlated with poor prognosis. The fact that B2M is primarily expressed by the stroma of the ESCC tissue strengthens our hypothesis that in ESCC, MSCs-derived B2M promotes tumor-initiation and invasion via enhancing EMT, resulting in an adverse prognosis for the patients. Our results will be valuable for the prediction of the development and treatment of ESCC."
"The important component of obesity pathogenesis is inflammatory activation of innate immune cells within adipose tissue and in other body locations. Both the course of obesity and innate immune reactivity are characterized by sex-associated differences. The aim of the work was a comparative investigation of metabolic profiles of phagocytes from different locations in male and female rats with MSG-induced obesity. The administration of monosodium glutamate (MSG) caused obesity, with sex-associated differences, that was more severe in male rats. Obesity was associated with pro-inflammatory activation of CD14+ phagocytes from adipose tissue in female, but not in male rats, which was demonstrated by decreased phagocytosis activity along with increased ROS generation. Phagocytes from the peritoneal cavity and peripheral blood of obese female rats exhibited neutral metabolic profile, whereas those cells from obese male rats displayed a pro-inflammatory metabolic profile. Thus, the manifestation of obesity-induced inflammation was characterized by different patterns of metabolic profile of phagocytes in male and female rats. Identified immune cell characteristics expand our knowledge of obesity immunobiology and may help to develop more effective preventive and therapeutic interventions for obese patients of different sexes."
"Our knowledge as to how bacteria acquire antibiotic resistance is still fragmented, especially for the ribosome-targeting drugs. In this study, with the aim of finding novel mechanisms that render bacteria resistant to the ribosome-targeting antibiotics, we developed a general method to systematically screen for antibiotic resistant 16?S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), which are the major target for multiple antibiotics (e.g. spectinomycin, tetracycline, and aminoglycosides), and identify point mutations therein. We used Escherichia coli ?7, a null mutant of the rrn (ribosomal RNA) operons, as a surrogate host organism to construct a metagenomic library of 16?S rRNA genes from the natural (non-clinical) environment. The library was screened for spectinomycin resistance to obtain four resistant 16?S rRNA genes from non-E. coli bacterial species. Bioinformatic analysis and site-directed mutagenesis identified three novel mutations - U1183C (the first mutation discovered in a region other than helix 34), and C1063U and U1189C in helix 34 - as well as three well-described mutations (C1066U, C1192G, and G1193A). These results strongly suggest that uncharacterized antibiotic resistance mutations still exist, even for traditional antibiotics."
"The testis as a site for atherosclerotic changes has so far attracted little attention. We used the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)/low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor deficient mouse model (KO) for atherosclerosis (20, 40, 60 and 87-week-old) to investigate whether Leydig cells or the capillary network are responsible for reduced serum testosterone levels previously observed in extreme ages of this model. In KO mice, overall testosterone levels were reduced whereas the adrenal gland-specific corticosterone was increased excluding a general defect of steroid hormone production. In addition to micro-CT investigations for bigger vessels, stereology revealed a reduction of capillary length, volume and surface area suggesting capillary rarefaction as a factor for diminished testosterone. Stereological analyses of interstitial cells demonstrated significantly reduced Leydig cell numbers and size. These structural changes in the testis occurred on an inflammatory background revealed by qPCR. Reduced litter size of the KO mice suggests hypo- or infertility as a consequence of the testicular defects. Our data suggest reduced testosterone levels in this atherosclerosis model might be explained by both, rarefication of the capillary network and reduced Leydig cell number and size. Thus, this study calls for specific treatment of male infertility induced by microvascular damage through hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis."
"The concentrations of tropospheric CO2and O3have been rising due to human activities. These rising concentrations may have strong impacts on soil functions as changes in plant physiology may lead to altered plant-soil interactions. Here, the effects of eCO2and eO3on the removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pollutants in grassland soil were studied. Both elevated CO2and O3concentrations decreased PAH removal with lowest removal rates at elevated CO2and elevated O3concentrations. This effect was linked to a shift in soil microbial community structure by structural equation modeling. Elevated CO2and O3concentrations reduced the abundance of gram-positive bacteria, which were tightly linked to soil enzyme production and PAH degradation. Although plant diversity did not buffer CO2and O3effects, certain soil microbial communities and functions were affected by plant communities, indicating the potential for longer-term phytoremediation approaches. Results of this study show that elevated CO2and O3concentrations may compromise the ability of soils to degrade organic pollutants. On the other hand, the present study also indicates that the targeted assembly of plant communities may be a promising tool to shape soil microbial communities for the degradation of organic pollutants in a changing world."
"A developed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was employed to investigate changes of protein conformation, which played significant roles in maintaining stable protein networks of white croaker surimi gel, exploring the relationship between protein conformation and surimi gel networks. Spectra of surimi and gels with different grades (A, AA, FA and SA) were analyzed by tri-step FT-IR method and peak-fitting of deconvolved and baseline corrected amide I bands (1600~1700?cm-1). The result showed that ?-helix was the main conformation of surimi proteins. During surimi gelation, ?-helix of myosin partially transformed into ?-sheet, ?-turn and random coil structures. ?-sheet and random coil structures were the main protein conformations maintaining the structure of surimi gel, of which ?-sheet made the main contribution to gel strength. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) result revealed that surimi gels had a fibrous and homogeneous network structure. Moreover, ordered interconnections between three-dimensional proteins networks of gels were inclined to emerge in higher grade surimi, in agreement with the gel strength results. It was demonstrated that the tri-step FT-IR spectroscopy combined with peak-fitting could be applicable for exploration of surimi protein conformation changes during gelation to deepen understanding of its effect on gel quality."
"The discovery in animal research that fear memories may change upon retrieval has sparked a wave of interest into whether this phenomenon of reconsolidation also occurs in humans. The critical conditions under which memory reconsolidation can be observed and targeted in humans, however, remain elusive. Here we report that blocking beta-adrenergic receptors in the brain, either before or after reactivation, effectively neutralizes the expression of fear memory. We show a specific time-window during which beta-adrenergic receptors are involved in the reconsolidation of fear memory. Finally, we observe intact fear memory expression 12?h after reactivation and amnesic drug intake when the retention test takes place during the same day as the intervention, but post-reactivation amnesia after a night of sleep (12 h or 24 h later). We conclude that memory reconsolidation is not simply time-dependent, but that sleep is a final and necessary link to fundamentally change the fear memory engram."
"Compartmentalization of proteins into organelles is a promising strategy for enhancing the productivity of engineered eukaryotic organisms. However, approaches that co-opt endogenous organelles may be limited by the potential for unwanted crosstalk and disruption of native metabolic functions. Here, we present the construction of synthetic non-endogenous organelles in the eukaryotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, based on the prokaryotic family of self-assembling proteins known as encapsulins. We establish that encapsulins self-assemble to form nanoscale compartments in yeast, and that heterologous proteins can be selectively targeted for compartmentalization. Housing destabilized proteins within encapsulin compartments afford protection against proteolytic degradation in vivo, while the interaction between split protein components is enhanced upon co-localization within the compartment interior. Furthermore, encapsulin compartments can support enzymatic catalysis, with substrate turnover observed for an encapsulated yeast enzyme. Encapsulin compartments therefore represent a modular platform, orthogonal to existing organelles, for programming synthetic compartmentalization in eukaryotes."
"Incomplete delivery to the target cells is an obstacle for successful gene therapy approaches. Here we show unexpected effects of incomplete targeting, by demonstrating how heterogeneous inhibition of a growth promoting signaling pathway promotes tissue hyperplasia. We studied the function of the lymphangiogenic VEGFR3 receptor during embryonic and post-natal development. Inducible genetic deletion of Vegfr3 in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) leads to selection of non-targeted VEGFR3+cells at vessel tips, indicating an indispensable cell-autonomous function in migrating tip cells. Although Vegfr3 deletion results in lymphatic hypoplasia in mouse embryos, incomplete deletion during post-natal development instead causes excessive lymphangiogenesis. Analysis of mosaically targeted endothelium shows that VEGFR3-LECs non-cell-autonomously drive abnormal vessel anastomosis and hyperplasia by inducing proliferation of non-targeted VEGFR3+LECs through cell-contact-dependent reduction of Notch signaling. Heterogeneity in VEGFR3 levels thus drives vessel hyperplasia, which has implications for the understanding of mechanisms of developmental and pathological tissue growth."
"Local delivery of therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis (IA) is limited by short intra-articular half-lives. Since IA severity often fluctuates over time, a local drug delivery method that titrates drug release to arthritis activity would represent an attractive paradigm in IA therapy. Here we report the development of a hydrogel platform that exhibits disassembly and drug release controlled by the concentration of enzymes expressed during arthritis flares. In vitro, hydrogel loaded with triamcinolone acetonide (TA) releases drug on-demand upon exposure to enzymes or synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In arthritic mice, hydrogel loaded with a fluorescent dye demonstrates flare-dependent disassembly measured as loss of fluorescence. Moreover, a single dose of TA-loaded hydrogel but not the equivalent dose of locally injected free TA reduces arthritis activity in the injected paw. Together, our data suggest flare-responsive hydrogel as a promising next-generation drug delivery approach for the treatment of IA."
"Anteroposterior (AP) axis extension during gastrulation requires embryonic patterning and morphogenesis to be spatiotemporally coordinated, but the underlying genetic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we define a role for the conserved chromatin factor Gon4l, encoded by ugly duckling (udu), in coordinating tissue patterning and axis extension during zebrafish gastrulation through direct positive and negative regulation of gene expression. Although identified as a recessive enhancer of impaired axis extension in planar cell polarity (PCP) mutants, udu functions in a genetically independent, partially overlapping fashion with PCP signaling to regulate mediolateral cell polarity underlying axis extension in part by promoting notochord boundary formation. Gon4l limits expression of the cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecules EpCAM and Integrin?3b, excesses of which perturb the notochord boundary via tension-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. By promoting formation of this AP-aligned boundary and associated cell polarity, Gon4l cooperates with PCP signaling to coordinate morphogenesis along the AP embryonic axis."
"To realize the full potential of immunotherapy, it is critical to understand the drivers of tumor infiltration by immune cells. Previous studies have linked immune infiltration with tumor neoantigen levels, but the broad applicability of this concept remains unknown. Here, we find that while this observation is true across cancers characterized by recurrent mutations, it does not hold for cancers driven by recurrent copy number alterations, such as breast and pancreatic tumors. To understand immune invasion in these cancers, we developed an integrative multi-omics framework, identifying the DNA damage response protein ATM as a driver of cytokine production leading to increased immune infiltration. This prediction was validated in numerous orthogonal datasets, as well as experimentally in vitro and in vivo by cytokine release and immune cell migration. These findings demonstrate diverse drivers of immune cell infiltration across cancer lineages and may facilitate the clinical adaption of immunotherapies across diverse malignancies."
"Individuals in social insect colonies cooperate to perform collective work. While colonies often respond to changing environmental conditions by flexibly reallocating workers to different tasks, the factors determining which workers switch and why are not well understood. Here, we use an automated tracking system to continuously monitor nest behavior and foraging activity of uniquely identified workers from entire bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) colonies foraging in a natural outdoor environment. We show that most foraging is performed by a small number of workers and that the intensity and distribution of foraging is actively regulated at the colony level in response to forager removal. By analyzing worker nest behavior before and after forager removal, we show that spatial fidelity of workers within the nest generates uneven interaction with relevant localized information sources, and predicts which workers initiate foraging after disturbance. Our results highlight the importance of spatial fidelity for structuring information flow and regulating collective behavior in social insect colonies."
"A large-scale survey was conducted in domestic animal populations from 2011 to 2015 in Qingyang, China. A total of 448,398 animals from different districts of Qingyang were tested for the presence of Brucella-specific antibodies using the Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and the Standard Agglutination Test (SAT). From 2011 to 2015, the yearly average positive rates were between 0.04 and 4.75% in the eight counties tested. In addition, the prevalence rates were between 0 and 9.96% in these eight counties. Sheep was the dominant host of Brucella in Qingyang, and the prevalence rate in sheep (2.74%) was higher than those in the other animals tested. Identification of 10 Brucella isolates from sheep confirmed that the epidemic strains were B. melitensis biovar 3 (n?=?9) and B. melitensis biovar 1 (n?=?1). MLVA-11 (multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis) analysis of the 10 isolates showed three genotypes: genotype 116 (n?=?8), genotype 115 (n?=?1) and genotype 136 (n?=?1). Furthermore, analysis of the whole-genome sequences of the representative B. melitensis strain QY1 indicated that this isolate was closely related to isolates from China and India. The results of serum epidemiology confirmed that the region of northern Qingyang was a critical Brucella epidemic area and that the disease showed a rising trend, especially from 2013 to 2015. An analysis of the isolate genotypes suggested that sheep brucellosis mainly resulted from conventional B. melitensis (East Mediterranean group), although the external strain (American group) also occurred in Qingyang."
"Proper cerebellar development is dependent on tightly regulated proliferation, migration, and differentiation events. Disruptions in any of these leads to a range of cerebellar phenotypes from ataxia to childhood tumors. Animal models have shown that proper regulation ofsonic hedgehog(Shh) signaling is crucial for normal cerebellar architecture, and increased signaling leads to cerebellar tumor formation. Primary cilia are known to be required for the proper regulation of multiple developmental signaling pathways, includingShh.Tetratricopeptide Repeat Domain 21B(Ttc21b) is required for proper primary cilia form and function, and is primarily thought to restrictShhsignaling. Here we investigated a role forTtc21bin cerebellar development. Surprisingly,Ttc21bablation in Bergmann glia resulted in the accumulation of ectopic granule cells in the lower/posterior lobes of the cerebellum and a reduction inShhsignaling.Ttc21bablation in just Purkinje cells resulted in a similar phenotype seen in fewer cells, but across the entire extent of the cerebellum. These results suggest thatTtc21bexpression is required for Bergmann glia structure and signaling in the developing cerebellum, and in some contexts, augments rather than attenuatesShhsignaling."
"An incomplete septation of the ventricles in the vertebrate heart that disturbes the strict separation between the contents of the two ventricles is termed a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Together with bicuspid aortic valves, it is the most frequent congenital heart disease in humans. Until now, life-threatening VSDs are usually treated surgically. To avoid surgery and to develop an alternative therapy (e.g., a small molecule therapy), it is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying ventricular septum (VS) development. Consequently, various studies focus on the investigation of signalling pathways, which play essential roles in the formation of the VS. In the past decade, several reports found evidence for an involvement of Hedgehog (HH) signalling in VS development. In this review article, we will summarise the current knowledge about the association between HH signalling and VS formation and discuss the use of such knowledge to design treatment strategies against the development of VSDs."
"The recent development of transposon and CRISPR-Cas9-based tools for manipulating the fly genome in vivo promises tremendous progress in our ability to study developmental processes. Tools for introducing tags into genes at their endogenous genomic loci facilitate imaging or biochemistry approaches at the cellular or subcellular levels. Similarly, the ability to make specific alterations to the genome sequence allows much more precise genetic control to address questions of gene function."
"Hedgehog (Hh)/GLI signaling is an important instructive cue in various processes during embryonic development, such as tissue patterning, stem cell maintenance, and cell differentiation. It also plays crucial roles in the development of many pediatric and adult malignancies. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of pathway regulation is therefore of high interest. Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKs) comprise a group of protein kinases which are emerging modulators of signal transduction, cell proliferation, survival, and cell differentiation. Work from the last years has identified a close regulatory connection between DYRKs and the Hh signaling system. In this manuscript, we outline the mechanistic influence of DYRK kinases on Hh signaling with a focus on the mammalian situation. We furthermore aim to bring together what is known about the functional consequences of a DYRK-Hh cross-talk and how this might affect cellular processes in development, physiology, and pathology."

"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is an essential signaling peptide required for normal embryonic development. It represents a highly-conserved marker of odontogenesis amongst the toothed vertebrates. Signal transduction is involved in early specification of the tooth-forming epithelium in the oral cavity, and, ultimately, in defining tooth number within the established dentition. Shh also promotes the morphogenetic movement of epithelial cells in the early tooth bud, and influences cell cycle regulation, morphogenesis, and differentiation in the tooth germ. More recently, Shh has been identified as a stem cell regulator in the continuously erupting incisors of mice. Here, we review contemporary data relating to the role of Shh in odontogenesis, focusing on tooth development in mammals and cartilaginous fishes. We also describe the multiple actions of this signaling protein at the cellular level."
"This Special Issue of Journal of Developmental Biology (JDB) covers an indeed very ""special"" (at least to me) family of highly evolutionarily conserved genes, the Hox genes.[...]."
"The canonical hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway is of major importance during embryonic development. HH is a key regulatory morphogen of numerous cellular processes, namely, cell growth and survival, differentiation, migration, and tissue polarity. Overall, it is able to trigger tissue-specific responses that, ultimately, contribute to the formation of a fully functional organism. Of all three HH proteins, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) plays an essential role during lung development. In fact, abnormal levels of this secreted protein lead to severe foregut defects and lung hypoplasia. Canonical SHH signal transduction relies on the presence of transmembrane receptors, such as Patched1 and Smoothened, accessory proteins, as Hedgehog-interacting protein 1, and intracellular effector proteins, like GLI transcription factors. Altogether, this complex signaling machinery contributes to conveying SHH response. Pulmonary morphogenesis is deeply dependent on SHH and on its molecular interactions with other signaling pathways. In this review, the role of SHH in early stages of lung development, specifically in lung specification, primary bud formation, and branching morphogenesis is thoroughly reviewed."
"Spindly was originally identified as a specific regulator of Dynein activity at the kinetochore. In early prometaphase, Spindly recruits the Dynein/Dynactin complex, promoting the establishment of stable kinetochore-microtubule interactions and progression into anaphase. While details of Spindly function in mitosis have been worked out in cultured human cells and in theC. eleganszygote, the function of Spindly within the context of an organism has not yet been addressed. Here, we present loss- and gain-of-function studies of Spindly using transgenic RNAi inDrosophila. Knock-down of Spindly in the female germ line results in mitotic arrest during embryonic cleavage divisions. We investigated the requirements of Spindly protein domains for its localisation and function, and found that the carboxy-terminal region controls Spindly localisation in a cell-type specific manner. Overexpression of Spindly in the female germ line is embryonic lethal and results in altered egg morphology. To determine whether Spindly plays a role in post-mitotic cells, we altered Spindly protein levels in migrating cells and found that ovarian border cell migration is sensitive to the levels of Spindly protein. Our study uncovers novel functions of Spindly and a differential, functional requirement for its carboxy-terminal region inDrosophila."
"In mammals, the Wnt/?-catenin signal transduction pathway regulates intestinal stem cell maintenance and proliferation, whereas Wnt pathway hyperactivation, resulting primarily from the inactivation of the tumor suppressor Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), triggers the development of the vast majority of colorectal cancers. The Drosophila adult gut has recently emerged as a powerful model to elucidate the mechanisms by which Wingless/Wnt signaling regulates intestinal development, homeostasis, regeneration, and tumorigenesis. Herein, we review recent insights on the roles of Wnt signaling in Drosophila intestinal physiology and pathology."
"Alcoholic myopathies are characterized by neuromusculoskeletal symptoms such as compromised movement and weakness. Although these symptoms have been attributed to neurological damage, EtOH may also target skeletal muscle. EtOH exposure during zebrafish primary muscle development or adulthood results in smaller muscle fibers. However, the effects of EtOH exposure on skeletal muscle during the growth period that follows primary muscle development are not well understood. We determined the effects of EtOH exposure on muscle during this phase of development. Strikingly, muscle fibers at this stage are acutely sensitive to EtOH treatment: EtOH induces muscle degeneration. The severity of EtOH-induced muscle damage varies but muscle becomes more refractory to EtOH as muscle develops. NF-kB induction in muscle indicates that EtOH triggers a pro-inflammatory response. EtOH-induced muscle damage is p53-independent. Uptake of Evans blue dye shows that EtOH treatment causes sarcolemmal instability before muscle fiber detachment. Dystrophin-nullsapjemutant zebrafish also exhibit sarcolemmal instability. We tested whether Trichostatin A (TSA), which reduces muscle degeneration insapjemutants, would affect EtOH-treated zebrafish. We found that TSA and EtOH are a lethal combination. EtOH does, however, exacerbate muscle degeneration insapjemutants. EtOH also disrupts adhesion of muscle fibers to their extracellular matrix at the myotendinous junction: some detached muscle fibers retain beta-Dystroglycan indicating failure of muscle end attachments. Overexpression of Paxillin, which reduces muscle degeneration in zebrafish deficient for beta-Dystroglycan, is not sufficient to rescue degeneration. Taken together, our results suggest that EtOH exposure has pleiotropic deleterious effects on skeletal muscle."
"Early development is punctuated by a series of pervasive and fast paced transitions. These events reshape a differentiated oocyte into a totipotent embryo and allow it to gradually mount a genetic program of its own, thereby framing a new organism. Specifically, developmental transitions that ensure the maternal to embryonic control of developmental events entail a deep remodeling of transcriptional and transcriptomic landscapes.Drosophilaprovides an elegant and genetically tractable system to investigate these conserved changes at a dazzling developmental pace. Here, we review recent studies applying emerging technologies such as ribosome profiling, in situ Hi-C chromatin probing and live embryo RNA imaging to investigate the transcriptional dynamics at play duringDrosophilaembryogenesis. In light of this new literature, we revisit the main models of zygotic genome activation (ZGA). We also review the contributions played by zygotic transcription in shaping embryogenesis and explore emerging concepts of processes such as transcriptional bursting and transcriptional memory."
"The ubiquitin and SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) pathways modify proteins that in turn regulate diverse cellular processes, embryonic development, and adult tissue physiology. These pathways were originally discovered biochemically in vitro, leading to a long-standing challenge of elucidating both the molecular cross-talk between these pathways and their biological importance. Recent discoveries inDrosophilaestablished that ubiquitin and SUMO pathways are interconnected via evolutionally conserved SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) proteins. STUbL are RING ubiquitin ligases that recognize SUMOylated substrates and catalyze their ubiquitination, and include Degringolade (Dgrn) inDrosophilaand RNF4 and RNF111 in humans. STUbL are essential for early development of both the fly and mouse embryos. In the fly embryo, Dgrn regulates early cell cycle progression, sex determination, zygotic gene transcription, segmentation, and neurogenesis, among other processes. In the fly adult, Dgrn is required for systemic immune response to pathogens and intestinal stem cell regeneration upon infection. These functions of Dgrn are highly conserved in humans, where RNF4-dependent ubiquitination potentiates key oncoproteins, thereby accelerating tumorigenesis. Here, we review the lessons learned to date inDrosophilaand highlight their relevance to cancer biology."
"Modeling human disease in animals is an important strategy to discover potential methods of intervention. We suggest that there is much to be gained by employing a multi-model approach that takes advantage of different animal systems used in the laboratory simultaneously. We use the example of modeling Alzheimer's disease inDrosophila melanogaster,Caenorhabditis elegans, andDanio rerioto illustrate how such an approach can be employed to investigate the pathophysiology of the disease."
"Aging involves tissue accumulation of senescent cells (SC) whose elimination through senolytic approaches may evoke organismal rejuvenation. SC also contribute to aging-associated pathologies including cancer, hence it is imperative to better identify and target SC. Here, we aimed to identify new cell-surface proteins differentially expressed on human SC. Besides previously reported proteins enriched on SC, we identified 78 proteins enriched and 73 proteins underrepresented in replicatively senescent BJ fibroblasts, including L1CAM, whose expression is normally restricted to the neural system and kidneys. L1CAM was: 1) induced in premature forms of cellular senescence triggered chemically and by gamma-radiation, but not in Ras-induced senescence; 2) induced upon inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases by p16INK4a; 3) induced by TGFbeta and suppressed by RAS/MAPK(Erk) signaling (the latter explaining the lack of L1CAM induction in RAS-induced senescence); and 4) induced upon downregulation of growth-associated gene ANT2, growth in low-glucose medium or inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. These data indicate that L1CAM is controlled by a number of cell growth- and metabolism-related pathways during SC development. Functionally, SC with enhanced surface L1CAM showed increased adhesion to extracellular matrix and migrated faster. Our results provide mechanistic insights into senescence of human cells, with implications for future senolytic strategies."
"Invasive species frequently cope with ecological conditions that are different from those to which they adapted, presenting an opportunity to investigate how phenotypes change across short time scales. In 2000, the guttural toadSclerophrys gutturaliswas first detected in a peri-urban area of Cape Town, where it is now invasive. The ability of the species to invade Cape Town is surprising since the area is characterised by a mediterranean climate significantly drier and colder than that of the native source area. We measured field hydration state of guttural toads from the invasive Cape Town population and a presumed native source population from Durban. We also obtained from laboratory trials: rates of evaporative water loss and water uptake, sensitivity of locomotor endurance to hydration state, critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and sensitivity of CTminto hydration state. Field hydration state of invasive toads was significantly lower than that of native toads. Although the two populations had similar rates of water loss and uptake, invasive toads were more efficient in minimising water loss through postural adjustments. In locomotor trials, invasive individuals noticeably outperformed native individuals when dehydrated but not when fully hydrated. CTminwas lower in invasive individuals than in native individuals independently of hydration state. Our results indicate that an invasive population that is only 20 years old shows adaptive responses reducing phenotypic mismatch with the novel environment. The invasion potential of the species in Cape Town is higher than we could infer from its characteristics in the native source population."
"While the call repertoire and its communicative function is relatively well explored in Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), little empirical data is available on the physics and the physiology of this species' vocal production mechanism. Here, a 6 year old female Japanese macaque was trained to phonate under an operant conditioning paradigm. The resulting ""coo"" calls, and spontaneously uttered ""growl"" and ""chirp"" calls, were recorded with sound pressure level (SPL) calibrated microphones and electroglottography (EGG), a non-invasive method for assessing the dynamics of phonation. A total of 448 calls were recorded, complemented byex vivorecordings on an excised Japanese macaque larynx. In this novel multidimensional investigative paradigm,in vivoandex vivodata were matched via comparable EGG waveforms. Subsequent analysis suggests that the vocal range (range of fundamental frequency and SPL) was comparable to that of a 7-10 year old human, with the exception of low-intensity chirps, whose production may be facilitated by the species' vocal membranes. In coo calls, redundant control of fundamental frequency in relation to SPL was also comparable to humans. EGG data revealed that growls, coos, and chirps were produced by distinct laryngeal vibratory mechanisms. EGG further suggested changes in the degree of vocal fold adductionin vivo, resulting in spectral variation within the emitted coo calls, ranging from ""breathy"" (including aerodynamic noise components) to ""non-breathy"". This is again analogous to humans, corroborating the notion that phonation in humans and non-human primates is based on universal physical and physiological principles."
"Terrestrial arthropods achieve waterproofing by a layer of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). At the same time, CHCs also serve as communication signals. To maintain waterproofing under different climate conditions, insects adjust the chemical composition of their CHC layer, but this may affect the communication via CHC. The detailed acclimatory changes of CHCs and how these influence their physical properties are still unknown. Here, we studied acclimation in two closely related ant species with distinct CHC profiles,Myrmica rubraandMyrmica ruginodis, in response to constant or fluctuating temperature and humidity regimes. We measured how acclimation affected CHC composition and viscosity, and the ants' drought survival. In both species, CHC composition showed strong, predictable responses to temperature regimes. Warm-acclimated individuals had higher proportions of linear alkanes, and less methyl-branched or unsaturated CHCs. These changes coincided with higher solid content and viscosity of CHCs in warm-acclimated ants. Temperature fluctuation caused effects similar to constant-cool conditions inMrubra, but led to entirely different profiles inMruginodis, suggesting that fluctuating and constant conditions pose very different challenges. Acclimation to dry conditions led to higher absolute amounts of CHCs, which increased the ants' drought survival, whereas temperature acclimation did not. Hence, the temperature-induced CHC changes cannot be explained by the need for waterproofing alone. While these changes could be non-adaptive, we propose that they serve to maintain a constant CHC viscosity, which may be essential for communication and other functions."
"Structural plumage colour is one of the most enigmatic sexually selected traits. The information content of structural colour variation is debated and the heterogeneity of the findings is hard to explain because the proximate background of within-species colour differences is very scarcely studied. We combined measurements of feather macrostructure and nanostructure to explain within-population variability in blue tit crown reflectance. We found that sexual dichromatism in aspects of crown reflectance was explained only by feather macrostructure, while nanostructural predictors accounted for some of the age-related differences of reflectance. Moreover, we found that both mean reflectance and spectral shape traits reflected a combination of quantity and regularity aspects in macro- and nanostructure. This rich proximate background provides ample scope for reflectance to convey various types of information on individual quality."
"Ventricular filling may occur directly from the venous circulation during early diastole or via atrial contraction in late diastole. The contribution of atrial contraction to ventricular filling is typically small in mammals (10-40%), but has been suggested to predominate in reptiles. We investigated the importance of atrial contraction in filling of the ventricle in American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) by bypassing both atria (with the use of ligatures to prevent atrial filling) and measuring the resultant effects on cardiac output in anesthetized animals. Atrial ligation had no significant effects on total systemic blood flow before or after adrenaline injection. Unexpectedly, pulmonary flow was increased following atrial ligation prior to adrenaline, but was unaffected after it. These findings suggest that the atria are non-essential (i.e. redundant) for ventricular filling in alligators, at least under anesthesia, but may serve as important volume reservoirs."
"Fish swimming energetics are often measured in laboratory environments which attempt to minimize turbulence, though turbulent flows are common in the natural environment. To test whether the swimming energetics and kinematics of shiner perchCymatogaster aggregata(a labriform swimmer) were affected by turbulence, two flow conditions were constructed in a swim-tunnel respirometer. A low-turbulence flow was created using a common swim-tunnel respirometry setup with a flow straightener and fine-mesh grid to minimize velocity fluctuations. A high-turbulence flow condition was created by allowing large velocity fluctuations to persist without a flow straightener or fine grid. The two conditions were tested with Particle Image Velocimetry to confirm significantly different turbulence properties throughout a range of mean flow speeds. Oxygen consumption rates of the swimming fish increased with swimming speeds and pectoral fin beat frequencies in both flow conditions. Higher turbulence also caused a greater positional variability in swimming individuals (vs.low-turbulence flow) at medium and high speeds. Surprisingly, fish used less oxygen in high turbulence compared to low-turbulence flow at medium and high swimming speeds. Simultaneous measurements of swimming kinematics indicated that these reductions in oxygen consumption could not be explained by specific known flow-adaptive behaviours such as Kármán-gaiting or entraining. Therefore, fish in high-turbulence flow may take advantage of the high variability in turbulent energy through time. These results suggest that swimming behavior and energetics measured in the lab in straightened flow, typical of standard swimming respirometers, might differ from that of more turbulent, semi-natural flow conditions."
"The transcription factors p53 and p73 are critical to the induction of apoptotic cell death, particularly in response to cell stress that activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53, which are commonly seen in cancers, result in conformational changes that enable p53 to interact with and inhibit p73, thereby suppressing apoptosis. In contrast, wild-type p53 reportedly does not interact with p73. We found that JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Thr81in the proline-rich domain (PRD) of p53 enabled wild-type p53, as well as mutant p53, to form a complex with p73. Structural algorithms predicted that phosphorylation of Thr81exposes the DNA-binding domain in p53 to enable its binding to p73. The dimerization of wild-type p53 with p73 facilitated the expression of apoptotic target genes [such as those encoding p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX)] and, subsequently, the induction of apoptosis in response to JNK activation by cell stress in various cells. Thus, JNK phosphorylation of mutant and wild-type p53 promotes the formation of a p53/p73 complex that determines cell fate: apoptosis in the context of wild-type p53 or cell survival in the context of the mutant. These findings refine our current understanding of both the mechanistic links between p53 and p73 and the functional role for Thr81phosphorylation."
"Cytokines belonging to the common gamma chain (?c) family depend on the shared ?creceptor subunit for signaling. We report the existence of a fast, cytokine-induced pathway cross-talk acting at the receptor level, resulting from a limiting amount of ?con the surface of T cells. We found that this limited abundance of ?creduced interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-21 responses after IL-7 preexposure but not vice versa. Computational modeling combined with quantitative experimental assays indicated that the asymmetric cross-talk resulted from the ability of the ""private"" IL-7 receptor subunits (IL-7R?) to bind to many of the ?cmolecules even before stimulation with cytokine. Upon exposure of T cells to IL-7, the high affinity of the IL-7R?:IL-7 complex for ?cfurther reduced the amount of free ?cin a manner dependent on the concentration of IL-7. Measurements of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between IL-4R? and ?cwere reduced when IL-7R? was overexpressed. Furthermore, in a system expressing IL-7R?, IL-4R?, and ?c, BRET between IL-4R? and ?cincreased after IL-4 binding and decreased when cells were preexposed to IL-7, supporting the assumption that IL-7R? and the IL-7R?:IL-7 complex limit the accessibility of ?cfor other cytokine receptor complexes. We propose that in complex inflammatory environments, such asymmetric cross-talk establishes a hierarchy of cytokine responsiveness."
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) remains one of the most lethal tumor types, with extremely low survival rates due to late diagnosis and resistance to standard therapies. A more comprehensive understanding of the complexity of PDA pathobiology, and especially of the role of the tumor microenvironment in disease progression, should pave the way for therapies to improve patient response rates. In this study, we identify galectin-1 (Gal1), a glycan-binding protein that is highly overexpressed in PDA stroma, as a major driver of pancreatic cancer progression. Genetic deletion of Gal1 in aKras-driven mouse model of PDA (Ela-KrasG12Vp53
                        -/-
                    ) results in a significant increase in survival through mechanisms involving decreased stroma activation, attenuated vascularization, and enhanced T cell infiltration leading to diminished metastasis rates. In a human setting, human pancreatic stellate cells (HPSCs) promote cancer proliferation, migration, and invasion via Gal1-driven pathways. Moreover, in vivo orthotopic coinjection of pancreatic tumor cells with Gal1-depleted HPSCs leads to impaired tumor formation and metastasis in mice. Gene-expression analyses of pancreatic tumor cells exposed to Gal1 reveal modulation of multiple regulatory pathways involved in tumor progression. Thus, Gal1 hierarchically regulates different events implicated in PDA biology including tumor cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, inflammation, and metastasis, highlighting the broad therapeutic potential of Gal1-specific inhibitors, either alone or in combination with other therapeutic modalities."
"The obligate intracellular parasiteToxoplasma gondiicontrols its host cell from within the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) by using a number of diverse effector proteins, a subset of which require the aspartyl protease 5 enzyme (ASP5) and/or the recently discovered MYR1 protein to cross the PV membrane. To examine the impact these effectors have in the context of the entirety of the host response toToxoplasma, we used RNA-Seq to analyze the transcriptome expression profiles of human foreskin fibroblasts infected with wild-type RH (RH-WT), RH?myr1, and RH?asp5tachyzoites. Interestingly, the majority of the differentially regulated genes responding toToxoplasmainfection are MYR1 dependent. A subset of MYR1 responses were ASP5 independent, and MYR1 function did not require ASP5 cleavage, suggesting the export of some effectors requires only MYR1. Gene set enrichment analysis of MYR1-dependent host responses suggests an upregulation of E2F transcription factors and the cell cycle and a downregulation related to interferon signaling, among numerous others. Most surprisingly, ""hidden"" responses arising in RH?myr1- but not RH-WT-infected host cells indicate counterbalancing actions of MYR1-dependent and -independent activities. The host genes and gene sets revealed here to be MYR1 dependent provide new insight into the parasite's ability to co-opt host cell functions.IMPORTANCEToxoplasma gondiiis unique in its ability to successfully invade and replicate in a broad range of host species and cells within those hosts. The complex interplay of effector proteins exported byToxoplasmais key to its success in co-opting the host cell to create a favorable replicative niche. Here we show that a majority of the transcriptomic effects in tachyzoite-infected cells depend on the activity of a novel translocation system involving MYR1 and that the effectors delivered by this system are part of an intricate interplay of activators and suppressors. Removal of all MYR1-dependent effectors reveals previously unknown activities that are masked or hidden by the action of these proteins."
"Elongation factor P (EF-P) is a ubiquitous translation factor that facilitates translation of polyproline motifs. In order to perform this function, EF-P generally requires posttranslational modification (PTM) on a conserved residue. Although the position of the modification is highly conserved, the structure can vary widely between organisms. InBacillus subtilis, EF-P is modified at Lys32 with a 5-aminopentanol moiety. Here, we use a forward genetic screen to identify genes involved in 5-aminopentanolylation. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the PTM mutant strains indicated thatynbB,gsaB, andymfIare required for modification and thatyaaO,yfkA, andywlGinfluence the level of modification. Structural analyses also showed that EF-P can retain unique intermediate modifications, suggesting that 5-aminopentanol is likely directly assembled on EF-P through a novel modification pathway. Phenotypic characterization of these PTM mutants showed that each mutant does not strictly phenocopy theefpmutant, as has previously been observed in other organisms. Rather, each mutant displays phenotypic characteristics consistent with those of either theefpmutant or wild-typeB. subtilisdepending on the growth condition.In vivopolyproline reporter data indicate that the observed phenotypic differences result from variation in both the severity of polyproline translation defects and altered EF-P context dependence in each mutant. Together, these findings establish a new EF-P PTM pathway and also highlight a unique relationship between EF-P modification and polyproline context dependence.IMPORTANCEDespite the high level of conservation of EF-P, the posttranslational modification pathway that activates EF-P is highly divergent between species. Here, we have identified and characterized inB. subtilisa novel posttranslational modification pathway. This pathway not only broadens the scope of potential EF-P modification strategies, but it also indicates that EF-P modifications can be assembled directly on EF-P. Furthermore, characterization of these PTM mutants has established that an altered modification state can impact both the severity of polyproline translational defects and context dependence."
"Keratinized epidermis constitutes a powerful barrier of the mucosa and skin, effectively preventing bacterial invasion, unless it is wounded and no longer protective. Wound healing involves deposition of distinct extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins enriched in cellular fibronectin (cFn) isoforms containing extra domain A (EDA). The streptococcal collagen-like protein 1 (Scl1) is a surface adhesin of group A Streptococcus (GAS), which contains an N-terminal variable (V) domain and a C-terminally located collagen-like domain. During wound infection, Scl1 selectively binds EDA/cFn isoforms and laminin, as well as low-density lipoprotein (LDL), through its V domain. The trimeric V domain has a six-helical bundle fold composed of three pairs of anti-parallel ?-helices interconnected by hypervariable loops, but the roles of these structures in EDA/cFn binding are unclear. Here, using recombinant Scl constructs (rScl) to investigate structure-function determinants of the Scl1-EDA/cFn interaction, we found that full-length rScl1, containing both the globular V and the collagen domains, is necessary for EDA/cFn binding. We established that the surface-exposed loops, inter-connecting conserved ?-helices, guide recognition and binding of Scl1-V to EDA and binding to laminin and LDL. Moreover, electrostatic surface potential models of the Scl1 V domains pointed to a conserved, negatively charged pocket, surrounded by positively charged and neutral regions, as a determining factor for the binding. In light of these findings, we propose an updated model of EDA/cFn recognition by the Scl1 adhesin from GAS, representing a significant step in understanding the Scl1-ECM interactions within the wound microenvironment that underlie GAS pathogenesis."
"Neuronostatin, a somatostatin gene-encoded peptide, exerts important physiological and metabolic actions in diverse tissues. However, the direct biological effects of neuronostatin on pituitary function of humans and primates are still unknown. This study used baboon (Papio anubis) primary pituitary cell cultures, a species that closely models human physiology, to demonstrate that neuronostatin inhibits basal, but not ghrelin-/GnRH-stimulated, GH and LH secretion in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, without affecting the secretion of other pituitary hormones (prolactin, ACTH, FSH, TSH) or changing mRNA levels. Actions of neuronostatin differs from somatostatin which in this study reduced GH/PRL/ACTH/LH/TSH secretion and GH/PRL/POMC/LH gene-expression. Remarkably, we found that inhibitory actions of neuronostatin are likely mediated through: 1) the orphan receptor GPCR107 (found to be highly expressed in pituitary compared to somatostatin-receptors), 2) common (i.e. adenylyl-cyclase/protein kinase-A/MAPK/extra-/intra-cellular Ca2+ mobilization, but not phospholipase-C/protein kinase-C/mTOR) and distinct (i.e. PI3K) signaling pathways than somatostatin and; 3) dissimilar molecular mechanisms than somatostatin (i.e. upregulation of GPCR107 and downregulation of GHS-R/Kiss1-R expression by neuronostatin and, upregulation of sst1-5 expression by somatostatin). Altogether, the results of this study provide the first evidence that there is a functional neuronostatin signaling circuit, unique from somatostatin, which may work in concert with somatostatin to fine-tune hormone release from somatostropes and gonadotropes."
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding single-stranded RNA that are integral to a wide range of cellular processes mainly through the regulation of translation and mRNA stability of their target genes. The placenta is a transient organ that exists throughout gestation in mammals, facilitating nutrient and gas exchange and waste removal between the mother and the fetus. MiRNAs are expressed in the placenta and many studies have shown that miRNAs play an important role in regulating trophoblast differentiation, migration, invasion, proliferation, apoptosis, vasculogenesis/angiogenesis, and cellular metabolism. In this review, we provide a brief overview of canonical and non-canonical pathways of miRNA biogenesis and mechanisms of miRNA actions. We highlight the current knowledge of the role of miRNAs in placental development. Finally, we point out several limitations of the current research and suggest future directions."
"Type II isoforms of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA-II) contain a phosphorylatable epitope within the inhibitory domain of RII subunits (pRII) with still unclear function. In vitro, RII phosphorylation occurs in the absence of cAMP, whereas staining of cells with pRII-specific antibodies revealed a cAMP-dependent pattern. In sensory neurons, we found that increased pRII immunoreactivity reflects increased accessibility of the already phosphorylated RII epitope during cAMP-induced opening of the tetrameric RII2:C2holoenzyme. Accordingly, induction of pRII by cAMP was sensitive to novel inhibitors of dissociation, whereas blocking catalytic activity was ineffective. Also in vitro, cAMP increased the binding of pRII antibodies to RII2:C2holoenzymes. Identification of an antibody specific for the glycine-rich loop of catalytic subunits facing the pRII-epitope confirmed activity-dependent binding with similar kinetics, proving that the reassociation is rapid and precisely controlled. Mechanistic modeling further supported that RII phosphorylation precedes cAMP binding and controls the inactivation by modulating the reassociation involving the coordinated action of phosphodiesterases and phosphatases."
"Embryonic morphogenesis of a complex organism requires proper regulation of patterning and directional growth. The Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling is emerging as a critical evolutionarily conserved mechanism whereby directional information is conveyed. PCP is thought to be established by global cues, and recent studies have revealed an instructive role of Wnt signaling gradient in epithelia tissues of both invertebrates and vertebrates. However, it remains unclear whether Wnt/PCP signaling is coordinately regulated with embryonic patterning during morphogenesis. Here in the mammalian developing limbs, we find that the AER-derived Fgfs required for limb patterning regulates PCP along the proximal-distal axis in a Wnt5a-dependent manner. We demonstrate with genetic evidence that Wnt5a gradient acts as a global cue that is instructive in establishing PCP in the limb mesenchyme, while Wnt5a also plays a permissive role to allow Fgf signaling to orient PCP. Our results indicate that limb morphogenesis is critically regulated by coordination of directional growth and patterning through integrating Wnt5a and Fgf signaling in PCP regulation."
"ZIP4 is overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer and promotes tumor growth. However, little is known about the role of ZIP4 in advanced stages of this dismal neoplasm. Our goal is to study the underlying mechanism and define a novel signaling pathway controlled by ZIP4 modulating pancreatic tumor metastasis.The expression of ZIP4, ZO-1, claudin-1, and ZEB1 in human pancreatic cancer tissues, genetically engineered mouse model, xenograft tumor model and pancreatic cancer cell lines were examined, and the correlations between ZIP4 and those markers were also analyzed. Functional analysis of ZO-1, claudin-1, and ZEB1 was investigated in pancreatic cancer cell lines and orthotopic xenografts.Genetic inactivation of ZIP4 inhibited migration and invasion in pancreatic cancer, and increased the expression of ZO-1 and claudin-1. Conversely, overexpression of ZIP4 promoted migration and invasion, and increased the expression of ZEB1 and downregulation of the aforementioned epithelial genes. ZIP4 downregulation of ZO-1 and claudin-1 requires the transcriptional repressor ZEB1. Further analysis demonstrated that ZIP4-mediated repression of ZO-1 and claudin-1 lead to upregulation of their targets FAK and Paxillin. Silencing of ZIP4 caused reduced phosphorylation of FAK and Paxillin, which was rescued by simultaneous blocking of ZO-1 or claudin-1. Clinically, we demonstrated that ZIP4 positively correlates with the levels of ZEB1 and inversely associates with the expression of ZO-1 and claudin-1. These findings suggest a novel pathway activated by ZIP4 controlling pancreatic cancer invasiveness and metastasis, which could serve as a new therapeutic target for this devastating disease."
"The formation of neurites is an important process affecting the cognitive abilities of an organism. Neurite growth requires the addition of new membranes, but the metabolic remodeling necessary to supply lipids for membrane expansion is poorly understood. Here, we show that synaptic activity, one of the most important inducers of neurite growth, transcriptionally regulates the expression of neuronal glucose transporter Glut3 and rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis, resulting in enhanced glucose uptake and metabolism that is partly used for lipid synthesis. Mechanistically, CREB regulates the expression of Glut3 and Siah2, the latter and LDH activity promoting the normoxic stabilization of HIF-1? that regulates the expression of rate-limiting genes of glycolysis. The expression of dominant-negative HIF-1? or Glut3 knockdown blocks activity-dependent neurite growthin vitrowhile pharmacological inhibition of the glycolysis and specific ablation of HIF-1? in early postnatal mice impairs the neurite architecture. These results suggest that the manipulation of neuronal glucose metabolism could be used to treat some brain developmental disorders."
"Tissues contain distinct stem cell niches, but whether cell turnover is coordinated between niches during growth is unknown. Here, we report that in mouse skin, hair growth is accompanied by sebaceous gland and interfollicular epidermis expansion. During hair growth, cells in the bulge and outer root sheath temporarily upregulate the glutamate transporter SLC1A3, and the number of SLC1A3+basal cells in interfollicular epidermis and sebaceous gland increases. Fate mapping of SLC1A3+cells in mice revealed transient expression in proliferating stem/progenitor cells in all three niches. Deletion ofslc1a3delays hair follicle anagen entry, uncouples interfollicular epidermis and sebaceous gland expansion from the hair cycle, and leads to reduced fur density in aged mice, indicating a role of SLC1A3 in stem/progenitor cell activation. Modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 activity mimics the effects of SLC1A3 deletion or inhibition. These data reveal that stem/progenitor cell activation is synchronized over distinct niches during growth and identify SLC1A3 as a general marker and effector of activated epithelial stem/progenitor cells throughout the skin."
"EPHX2 (soluble Epoxide Hydrolase 2, sEH) converts biologically active epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrinolytic effectors into the less biologically active metabolites, dihydroxyeicostrienoic acids. We sought to characterize the expression and the function of EPHX2 in diabetic corneas and during wound healing. The expression of EPHX2 at both mRNA and protein levels, as well as sEH enzymatic activity, were markedly upregulated in the tissues/cells, including corneal epithelial cells as well as the retina of human type-2, mouse type-1 (STZ-induced) and/or type-2 diabetes.Ephx2-depletion had no detectable effects on STZ-induced hyperglycemia but prevented the development of tear deficiency.Ephx2
                        -/-
                    mice showed an acceleration of hyperglycemia-delayed epithelium-wound healing. Moreover, inhibition of sEH increased the rate of epithelium-wound closure and restored hyperglycemia-suppressed STAT3 activation andheme oxygenase-1(HO-1) expression in the diabetic corneas. Treatment of diabetic corneas with Cobalt protoporphyrin, a well-known HO-1 inducer, restored wound-induced HO-1 upregulation and accelerated delayed wound healing. Finally,Ephx2-depletion enhanced sensory innervation and regeneration in diabetic corneas at 1 month after epithelial debridement. Our data suggests that increased sEH activity may be a contributing factor for diabetic corneal complications; targeting sEH pharmacologically or supplementing EETs may represent a new, adjunctive therapy for treating diabetic keratopathy."
"Radial artery access is commonly performed for coronary angiography and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Despite limitations in diagnostic accuracy, the modified Allen test (manual occlusion of radial and ulnar arteries followed by release of the latter and assessment of palmar blush) is used routinely to evaluate the collateral circulation to the hand and, therefore, to determine patient eligibility for radial artery access. We sought to evaluate whether a smartphone application may provide a superior alternative to the modified Allen test.We compared the modified Allen test with a smartphone heart rate-monitoring application (photoplethysmography readings detected using a smartphone camera lens placed on the patient's index finger) in patients undergoing a planned cardiac catheterization. Test order was randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion. All patients then underwent conventional plethysmography of the index finger, followed by Doppler ultrasonography of the radial and ulnar arteries (the diagnostic standard). The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy of the heart rate-monitoring application.Among 438 patients who were included in the study, we found that the heart rate-monitoring application had a superior diagnostic accuracy compared with the modified Allen test (91.8% v. 81.7%,p= 0.002), attributable to its greater specificity (93.0% v. 82.8%,p= 0.001). We also found that this application had greater diagnostic accuracy for assessment of radial or ulnar artery patency in the ipsilateral and contralateral wrist (94.0% v. 84.0%,p< 0.001).A smartphone application used at the bedside was diagnostically superior to traditional physical examination for confirming ulnar patency before radial artery access. This study highlights the potential for smartphone-based diagnostics to aid in clinical decision-making at the patient's bedside.Trial registration:Clinicaltrials.gov, no. NCT02519491."
"TheDrosophilaActivin signaling pathway employs at least three separate ligands, Activin-? (Act?), Dawdle (Daw), and Myoglianin (Myo), to regulate several general aspects of fruit fly larval development including cell proliferation, neuronal remodeling, and metabolism. Here we provide experimental evidence indicating that both Daw and Myo are anti-ageing factors in adult fruit flies. Knockdown of Myo or Daw in adult fruit flies reduced mean lifespan, while overexpression of either ligand in adult muscle tissues but not in adipose tissues enhanced mean lifespan. An examination of ubiquitinated protein aggregates in adult muscles revealed a strong inverse correlation between Myo or Daw initiated Activin signaling and the amount of ubiquitinated protein aggregates. We show that this correlation has important functional implications by demonstrating that the lifespan extension effect caused by overexpression of wild type Daw or Myo in adult muscle tissues can be completely abrogated by knockdown of a 26S proteasome regulatory subunit Rpn1 in adult fly muscle, and that the prolonged lifespan caused by overexpression of Daw or Myo in adult muscle could be due to enhanced protein levels of the key subunits of 26S proteasome. Overall, our data suggest that Activin signaling initiated by Myo and Daw in adultDrosophilamuscles influences lifespan, in part, by modulation of protein homeostasis through either direct or indirect regulation of the 26S proteasome levels. Since Myo is closely related to the vertebrate muscle mass regulator Myostatin (GDF8) and the Myostatin paralog GDF11, our observations may offer a new experimental model for probing the roles of GDF11/8 in ageing regulation in vertebrates."
"The success rate of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for fracture nonunions in human medicine (i.e., radiographic union at six months after ESWT) is only approximately 75%. Detailed knowledge regarding the underlying mechanisms that induce bio-calcification after ESWT is limited. We analyzed the biological response within mineralized tissue of a new invertebrate model organism, the zebra musselDreissena polymorpha, after exposure with extracorporeal shock waves (ESWs). Mussels were exposed to ESWs with positive energy density of 0.4 mJ/mm2(A) or were sham exposed (B). Detection of newly calcified tissue was performed by exposing the mussels to fluorescent markers. Two weeks later, the A-mussels showed a higher mean fluorescence signal intensity within the shell zone than the B-mussels (p<0.05). Acoustic measurements revealed that the increased mean fluorescence signal intensity within the shell of the A-mussels was independent of the size and position of the focal point of the ESWs. These data demonstrate that induction of bio-calcification after ESWT may not be restricted to the region of direct energy transfer of ESWs into calcified tissue. The results of the present study are of relevance for better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that induce formation of new mineralized tissue after ESWT."
"Micronutrient selenium (Se) plays a key role in redox regulation through its incorporation into selenoproteins as the 21stamino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Because Se deficiency appears to be a cofactor in the anemia associated with chronic inflammatory diseases, we reasoned that selenoproteins may contribute to erythropoietic recovery from anemia, referred to as stress erythropoiesis. Here, we report that loss of selenoproteins through Se deficiency or by mutation of the Sec tRNA (tRNA[Sec]) gene (Trsp) severely impairs stress erythropoiesis at two stages. Early stress erythroid progenitors failed to expand and properly differentiate into BFU-Es; while late stage erythroid progenitors exhibited a maturation defect that affected the transition of proerythroblasts (ProEs) to basophilic erythroblasts (BasoEs). These defects were, in part, due to the loss of selenoprotein W, whose expression was reduced at both transcript and protein levels in Se-deficient erythroblasts. Mutation of SelenoW in the bone marrow cells significantly decreased the expansion of stress BFU-E colonies, which recapitulated the phenotypes induced by Se deficiency or mutation ofTrspSimilarly, mutation of SelenoW in murine erythroblast (G1E) cells led to defects in terminal differentiation. In addition to the erythroid defects, the spleens of Se-deficient mice contained fewer red pulp macrophages and exhibited impaired development of erythroblastic island (EBI) macrophages, which make up the niche supporting erythroblast development. Taken together, these data reveal a critical role of selenoproteins in the expansion and development of stress erythroid progenitors as well as the erythroid niche during acute anemia recovery."
"Since a report of some 50 years ago describing refractory anemia associated with group C monosomy, monosomy 7 (-7) and interstitial deletions of chromosome 7 [del(7q)] have been established as one of the most frequent chromosomal aberrations found in essentially all types of myeloid tumors regardless of patient age and disease etiology. In the last century, researchers sought recessive myeloid tumor-suppressor genes by attempting to determine commonly-deleted regions (CDRs) in del(7q) patients. However, these efforts were not successful. Today, tumor-suppressors located in 7q are believed to act in a haplo-insufficient fashion, and powerful new technologies such as microarray comparative genomic hybridization and high-throughput sequencing allow comprehensive searches throughout the genes encoded on 7q. Among those proposed as promising candidates, four have been validated by gene-targeting in mouse models.SAMD9andSAMD9Lencode related endosomal proteins, mutations of which cause hereditary diseases with strong propensity to infantile MDS harboring monosomy 7. Because MDS develops inSAMD9L-deficient mice over their lifetime,SAMD9/SAMD9Lare likely responsible for sporadic MDS with -7/del(7q) as the sole anomaly.EZH2andMLL3encode histone-modifying enzymes; loss of function mutations of these are detected in some myeloid tumors at high frequencies. In contrast toSAMD9/SAMD9L, loss ofEZH2orMLL3likely contributes to myeloid tumorigenesis in cooperation with additional specific gene alterations such as ofTET2or genes involved in the p53/Ras pathway, respectively. Distinctive roles with different significance of the loss of multiple responsible genes render the complex nature of myeloid tumors carrying -7/del(7q)."
"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is characterized by increased B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and BTK inhibition is an effective therapeutic intervention in MCL patients. The mechanisms leading to increased BCR signaling in MCL are poorly understood, as mutations in upstream regulators of BCR signaling such as CD79A, commonly observed in other lymphomas, are rare in MCL. The transcription factor SOX11 is overexpressed in the majority (78-93%) of MCL patients and is considered an MCL-specific oncogene. So far, attempts to understand SOX11 function in vivo have been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models; since germline deletion of SOX11 is embryonically lethal. We have developed a transgenic mouse model (E?-SOX11-EGFP) in the C57BL/6 background expressing murine SOX11 and EGFP under the control of a B cell specific IgH-E? enhancer. The overexpression of SOX11 exclusively in B cells exhibits oligoclonal B cell hyperplasia in the spleen, bone marrow and peripheral blood, with an immunophenotype (CD5+CD19+CD23-) identical to human MCL. Further, phospho-CyTOF analysis of the splenocytes from these mice shows hyper-activation of pBTK and other molecules in the BCR signaling pathway and serial bone marrow transplant from transgenic donors produces lethality with decreasing latency. We report here that overexpression of SOX11 in B cells promotes BCR signaling and a disease phenotype that mimics human MCL."
"The prevalence of lower extremity artery disease (LEAD) is high (20%-25%) in the population older than 65 years, but patients are seldom identified until the disease is advanced. Circulating markers of disease activity might provide patients with a key opportunity for timely treatment. We tested the hypothesis that measuring blood-specific fragments generated during degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) could provide further insight into the pathophysiologic mechanism of arterial remodeling.The protein profile of diseased arteries from patients undergoing infrainguinal limb revascularization was assessed by a liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, nontargeted proteomic approach. The information retrieved was the basis for measurement of neoepitope fragments of ECM proteins in the blood of 195 consecutive patients with LEAD by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.Histologic and proteomic analyses confirmed the structural disorganization of affected arteries. Fourteen of 81 proteins were identified as differentially expressed in diseased arteries with respect to healthy tissues. Most of them were related to ECM components, and the difference in expression was used in multivariate analyses to establish that severe arterial lesions in LEAD patients have a specific proteome. Analysis of neoepitope fragments in blood revealed that fragments of versican and collagen type IV, alone or in combination, segregated patients with mild to moderate symptoms (intermittent claudication, Fontaine I-II) from those with severe LEAD (critical limb ischemia, Fontaine III-IV).We propose noninvasive candidate biomarkers with the ability to be clinically useful across the LEAD spectrum."
"The present study tests the accuracy of commonly adopted ageing methods based on the morphology of the pubic symphysis, auricular surface and cranial sutures. These methods are examined both in their traditional form as well as in the context of transition analysis using the ADBOU software in a modern Greek documented collection consisting of 140 individuals who lived mainly in the second half of the twentieth century and come from cemeteries in the area of Athens. The auricular surface overall produced the most accurate age estimates in our material, with different methods based on this anatomical area showing varying degrees of success for different age groups. The pubic symphysis produced accurate results primarily for young adults and the same applied to cranial sutures but the latter appeared completely inappropriate for older individuals. The use of transition analysis through the ADBOU software provided less accurate results than the corresponding traditional ageing methods in our sample. Our results are in agreement with those obtained from validation studies based on material from across the world, but certain differences identified with other studies on Greek material highlight the importance of taking into account intra- and inter-population variability in age estimation."
"Falcipain-2 (FP2) is an essential enzyme in the lifecycle of malaria parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum, and its inhibition is viewed as an attractive mechanism of action for new anti-malarial agents. Selective inhibition of FP2 with respect to a family of human cysteine proteases (that include cathepsins B, K, L and S) is likely to be required for the development of agents targeting FP2. Here we describe a series of P2-modified aminonitrile based inhibitors of FP2 that provide a clear strategy toward addressing selectivity for the P. falciparum and show that it can provide potent FP2 inhibitors with strong selectivity against all four of these human cathepsin isoforms."
"Radiotherapy (RT) is a common approach that accounts for nearly 50% of cancer patient treatment and has the potential for long-term tumor control. Recently, we published a research article on gene expression profiling of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) that were exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). Single-dose irradiation of tumors could initiate differentially expressed genes in TAM as a time series from irradiated tumors that are associated with the immune response. It is also well known that human cancers are associated with microRNA (miRNA) alterations that are involved in cancer progression. However, the role of miRNA on TAM after exposure to irradiation remains unclear.In this study, miRNA expression profiles from microarrays were used to identify the key miRNAs and correlating pathways involved in the role of TAMs in tumor progression and recurrence after RT. Using a mouse tumor model, we identified miRNA pattern changes over time in response to irradiation. Based on our results, we hypothesize that miRNA expression in the irradiated tumor may be used as a distinguishing marker to indicate the best time for therapeutic intervention to prevent tumor recurrence after RT.We established a murine model irradiated with a single dose of 25?Gy that could initiate temporal changes in the expression of miRNAs associated with cell proliferation and the immune response, as evidenced by macrophages directly extracted from irradiated tumors after two weeks of IR. Statistical analyses were conducted by comparing the miRNA expression in macrophages from non-irradiated versus irradiated tumors. Thus, our study could lead to a better understanding of the function of miRNA expressions, which changed temporally in an irradiated tumor microenvironment."
"Hearing and balance disorders are related to the inner ear and are among the major cause of falls in older adults. Hearing loss that commonly occurs with aging (aka presbyacusis) can result from noise exposure, smoking, ototoxic drugs and genetic factors such as mutations in nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been reported to play an important role in cell function by providing energy, as well as, cell death (apoptosis). This study aims to systematically review mitochondrial mutations associated with presbyacusis and suggests preventive measurements to improve the quality of life in older adults."
"The aim of this study was to describe and compare the occurrence of quinolone resistant Escherichia coli (QREC) in various animal species in relation to human population density. Data from the Norwegian monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in feed, food and animals from 2006 to 2016 was compiled and analysed. In total, 4568 E. coli isolates were included in this study. The isolates originated from broilers, layers, cattle, turkeys, dogs, wild birds, red foxes, reindeer, sheep, horses and pigs. Data regarding the geographical location of sampling was obtained for 4050 of these isolates and used to categorize the isolates depending on the human population density of the area. In total, 1.4% of the isolates were categorized as quinolone resistant. Compared to most European countries, there was an overall low occurrence of QREC in various animal species in Norway, though with an interspecies variation with the highest occurrence in broilers and wild birds (p?<?0.05). Human population density was not associated with the occurrence of QREC. Since fluoroquinolones are not used prophylactically and in almost negligent amounts in various species in Norway, the interspecies variation in the occurrence of QREC suggests that other factors than fluoroquinolone use may be important in the development of QREC."
"Gallibacterium anatis is an opportunistic poultry pathogen belonging to the Pasteurellaceae family. It has been shown to cause oophoritis, salpingitis and peritonitis in hens, as well as being associated with reduced semen quality in cockerels. Widespread multidrug resistance and substantial antigenic variation among strains of Gallibacterium anatis is a major constraint to treatment with antimicrobials and prevention of infection by vaccination. Novel vaccine strategies targeting G. anatis are therefore necessary. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are nanosized vesicles formed from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. These vesicles have shown promising potential as both adjuvants and as vaccine candidates against numerous bacterial species. A high vesiculating mutant of G. anatis (G. anatis ?tolR) has previously been made, enabling production of OMVs in large scale. In this study, we elucidated the potential of G. anatis ?tolR OMVs as adjuvant for the conserved antigens GtxA-N (the N-terminal part of the RTX like toxin Gallibacterium toxin A) and FlfA (F17-like fimbria), as well as evaluated if combinations of OMVs together with antigens could facilitate cross-protective immunity against three different strains of G. anatis. We showed that ?tolR OMVs function as an adjuvant for GtxA-N by inducing antigen specific antibody production. However, OMVs in combination with GtxA-N failed to induce protection against lesions after challenge infection. In contrast, vaccination with OMVs in combination with FlfA protected against lesions, especially in the salpinx, caused by two diverse strains of G. anatis, thereby indicating a cross-protective potential. No protection against the third G. anatis strain 7990 could be obtained in any of the experimental settings. In conclusion, ?tolR OMVs and FlfA could serve as potential future vaccine components againt G. anatis."
"The aim of this study was to investigate isolates of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae previously designated serologically either as non-typable (NT) or as 'K2:07', which did not produce serovar-specific amplicons in PCR assays. We used whole genome sequencing to identify the capsule (CPS) loci of six previously designated biovar 1 NT and two biovar 1 'K2:O7' isolates of A. pleuropneumoniae from Denmark, as well as a recent biovar 2 NT isolate from Canada. All of the NT isolates have the same six-gene type I CPS locus, sharing common cpsABC genes with serovars 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 13. The two 'K2:O7' isolates contain a unique three-gene type II CPS locus, having a cpsA gene similar to that of serovars 1, 4, 12, 14 and 15. The previously NT isolates share the same O-antigen genes, found between erpA and rpsU, as serovars 3, 6, 8, and 15. Whereas the 'K2:O7' isolates, have the same O-antigen genes as serovar 7, which likely contributed to their previous mis-identification. All of the NT and 'K2:O7' isolates have only the genes required for production of ApxII (apxIICA structural genes, and apxIBD export genes). Rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against representative isolates with these new CPS loci demonstrated distinct reactivity compared to the 16 known serovars. The serological and genomic results indicate that the isolates constitute new serovars 17 (previously NT) and 18 (previously 'K2:O7'). Primers designed for amplification of specific serovar 17 and 18 sequences for molecular diagnostics will facilitate epidemiological tracking of these two new serovars of A. pleuropneumoniae."
"This study was aimed to explore the effects of lncRNA BCAR4 on the viability and aggressiveness of non-smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.qRTPCR was used to determine the expression of lncRNA BCAR4 andGLI2downstream genes in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Chromatin isolation by RNA purification (CHIRP) and western blot were employed to measure the expression ofGLI2downstream proteins. Ki67 expression in nude mice tumors was tested by immunohistochemistry. MTT assay, wound healing assay, and transwell assay were used to assess NSCLC cell viability and aggressiveness, respectively. Tumor xenograft was conducted to determine the effects of lncRNA BCAR4 andGLI2on NSCLC tumorigenesisin vivo.The expression of lncRNA BCAR4 in NSCLC tissues and cells was significantly higher than normal level. The overexpression of BCAR4 promoted NSCLC cell viability, migration, and invasion. The suppression of BCAR4 andGLI2showed the opposite effects. The overexpression of BCAR4 led to the increase in the expression ofGLI2downstream proteins, while the suppression of BCAR4 andGLI2reduced their expression. In tumor xenograft assay, tumors in mice of BCAR4 group showed the biggest volume, while those in mice of si-GLI2 group showed the smallest volume. Ki67 showed much higher level in BCAR4 overexpression group but much lower level in si-GLI2 group."
"Snail intermediate hosts play active roles in the transmission of snail-borne trematode infections in Africa. A good knowledge of snail-borne diseases epidemiology particularly snail intermediate host populations would provide the necessary impetus to complementing existing control strategy.This review highlights the importance of molecular approaches in differentiating snail hosts population structure and the need to provide adequate information on snail host populations by updating snail hosts genome database for Africa, in order to equip different stakeholders with adequate information on the ecology of snail intermediate hosts and their roles in the transmission of different diseases. Also, we identify the gaps and areas where there is need for urgent intervention to facilitate effective integrated control of schistosomiasis and other snail-borne trematode infections.Prioritizing snail studies, especially snail differentiation using molecular tools will boost disease surveillance and also enhance efficient schistosomaisis control programme in Africa."
"The invasive mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis has established invasive populations across the globe and in some regions, have completely displaced native mussels through competitive exclusion. The objective of this study was to elucidate global connectivity patterns of M. galloprovincialis strictly using archived cytochrome c oxidase 1 sequence data obtained from public databases. Through exhaustive mining and the development of a systematic workflow, we compiled the most comprehensive global CO1 dataset for M. galloprovincialis thus far, consisting of 209 sequences representing 14 populations. Haplotype networks were constructed and genetic differentiation was assessed using pairwise analysis of molecular variance.There was significant genetic structuring across populations with significant geographic patterning of haplotypes. In particular, South Korea, South China, Turkey and Australasia appear to be the most genetically isolated populations. However, we were unable to recover a northern and southern hemisphere grouping for M. galloprovincialis as was found in previous studies. These results suggest a complex dispersal pattern for M. galloprovincialis driven by several contributors including both natural and anthropogenic dispersal mechanisms along with the possibility of potential hybridization and ancient vicariance events."
"Viral metagenomic studies have suggested a role for bacteriophages in intestinal dysbiosis associated with several human diseases. However, interpretation of viral metagenomic studies is limited by the lack of knowledge of phages infecting major human gut commensal bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a bacterial symbiont repeatedly found depleted in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. In particular, no complete genomes of phages infecting F. prausnitzii are present in viral databases.We identified 18 prophages in 15 genomes of F. prausnitzii, used comparative genomics to define eight phage clades, and annotated the genome of the type phage of each clade. For two of the phages, we studied prophage induction in vitro and in vivo in mice. Finally, we aligned reads from already published viral metagenomic data onto the newly identified phages.We show that each phage clade represents a novel viral genus and that a surprisingly large fraction of them (10 of the 18 phages) codes for a diversity-generating retroelement, which could contribute to their adaptation to the digestive tract environment. We obtained either experimental or in silico evidence of activity for at least one member of each genus. In addition, four of these phages are either significantly more prevalent or more abundant in stools of IBD patients than in those of healthy controls.Since IBD patients generally have less F. prausnitzii in their microbiota than healthy controls, the higher prevalence or abundance of some of its phages may indicate that they are activated during disease. This in turn suggests that phages could trigger or aggravate F. prausnitzii depletion in patients. Our results show that prophage detection in sequenced strains of the microbiota can usefully complement viral metagenomic studies."
"Despite the significant progress in the development of skin equivalents (SEs), the problem of noninvasively assessing the quality of the cell components and the collagen structure of living SEs both before and after transplantation remains. Undoubted preference is given to in vivo methods of noninvasive, label-free monitoring of the state of the SEs. Optical bioimaging methods, such as cross-polarization optical coherence tomography (CP OCT), multiphoton tomography (MPT), and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), present particular advantages for the visualization of such SEs.In this study, we simultaneously applied several visualization techniques for skin model examination. We investigated the structure and quality of dermal equivalents containing dermal papilla (DP) cells and dermal fibroblasts (FBs) using CP OCT, MPT, and FLIM. Both the energy metabolism of the cell components and the structuring of the collagen fibrils were addressed.Based on the data from the fluorescence lifetimes and the contributions of protein-bound NAD(P)H, a bias toward oxidative metabolism was indicated, for the first time, in both the DP cells and FBs on day 14 of SE cultivation. The CP OCT and MPT data also indicated that both DP cells and FBs structured the collagen gel in a similar manner.In this study, multimodal label-free imaging of the structure and quality of living dermal equivalents was implemented for the first time with the use CP OCT, MPT, and FLIM of NAD(P)H. Our data suggest that the combination of different imaging techniques provides an integrated approach to data acquisition regarding the structure and quality of dermal equivalents, minimizes the potential disadvantages of using a single method, and provides an ideal information profile for clinical and research applications."
"High-throughput methodologies such as microarrays and next-generation sequencing are routinely used in cancer research, generating complex data at different omics layers. The effective integration of omics data could provide a broader insight into the mechanisms of cancer biology, helping researchers and clinicians to develop personalized therapies.In the context of CAMDA 2017 Neuroblastoma Data Integration challenge, we explore the use of Integrative Network Fusion (INF), a bioinformatics framework combining a similarity network fusion with machine learning for the integration of multiple omics data. We apply the INF framework for the prediction of neuroblastoma patient outcome, integrating RNA-Seq, microarray and array comparative genomic hybridization data. We additionally explore the use of autoencoders as a method to integrate microarray expression and copy number data.The INF method is effective for the integration of multiple data sources providing compact feature signatures for patient classification with performances comparable to other methods. Latent space representation of the integrated data provided by the autoencoder approach gives promising results, both by improving classification on survival endpoints and by providing means to discover two groups of patients characterized by distinct overall survival (OS) curves.This article was reviewed by Djork-Arné Clevert and Tieliu Shi."
"Co-infection with loiasis remains a potential problem in control programs targeting filarial infections. The effects of many anti-parasitic drugs often administered to Loa loa infected people are not well documented. This study compared the in vitro activity of several of these drugs on the viability of L. loa microfilariae (mf).Human strain L. loa mf were isolated from baboon blood using iso-osmotic Percoll gradient, and cultured in RPMI 1640/10% FBS with antimalarial drugs (mefloquine, amodiaquine, artesunate, chloroquine and quinine), anthelmintics (ivermectin, praziquantel, flubendazole and its reduced and hydrolyzed metabolites), two potential trypanocidal agents (fexinidazole and Scynexis-7158) and the anticancer drug imatinib. The drug concentrations used varied between 0.156 ?g/ml and 10 ?g/ml. Mf motility (CR50= 50% immotility) and a metabolic viability assay (MTT) were used to assess the effects of these drugs on the parasites.Mf in control cultures showed only a slight reduction in motility after 5 days of culture. Active inhibition of Loa loa motility was seen with mefloquine and amodiaquine (CR50values of 3.87 and 4.05 ?g/ml, respectively), immobilizing > 90% mf within the first 24 hours: mefloquine killed the mf after 24 hours of culture at concentrations ? 5 ?g/ml. SCYX-7158 also induced a concentration-dependent reduction in mf motility, with > 50% reduction in mf motility seen after 5 days at 10 ?g/ml. The anticancer drug imatinib reduced mf motility at 10 ?g/ml from the first day of incubation to 55% by day 5, and the reduction in motility was concentration-dependent. Praziquantel and fexinidazole were inactive, and FLBZ and its metabolites, as well as ivermectin at concentrations > 5 ?g/ml, had very minimal effects on mf motility over the first 4 days of culture.The considerable action of the anti-malarial drugs mefloquine and amodiaquine on Loa mf in vitro highlights the possibility of repurposing the existing anti-infectious agents for the development of drugs against loiasis. The heterogeneity in the activity of anti-parasitic agents on Loa loa mf supports the need for further investigation using animal models of loiasis."
"Anxiety and depression are prevalent among cardiac rehabilitation patients but pharmacological and psychological treatments have limited effectiveness in this group. Furthermore, psychological interventions have not been systematically integrated into cardiac rehabilitation services despite being a strategic priority for the UK National Health Service. A promising new treatment, metacognitive therapy, may be well-suited to the needs of cardiac rehabilitation patients and has the potential to improve outcomes. It is based on the metacognitive model, which proposes that a thinking style dominated by rumination, worry and threat monitoring maintains emotional distress. Metacognitive therapy is highly effective at reducing this thinking style and alleviating anxiety and depression in mental health settings. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy for cardiac rehabilitation patients with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms.The PATHWAY Group-MCT trial is a multicentre, two-arm, single-blind, randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy plus usual cardiac rehabilitation to usual cardiac rehabilitation alone. Cardiac rehabilitation patients (target sample n = 332) with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will be recruited across five UK National Health Service Trusts. Participants randomised to the intervention arm will receive six weekly sessions of group-based metacognitive therapy delivered by either cardiac rehabilitation professionals or research nurses. The intervention and control groups will both be offered the usual cardiac rehabilitation programme within their Trust. The primary outcome is severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms at 4-month follow-up measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score. Secondary outcomes are severity of anxiety/depression at 12-month follow-up, health-related quality of life, severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms and strength of metacognitive beliefs at 4- and 12-month follow-up. Qualitative interviews will help to develop an account of barriers and enablers to the effectiveness of the intervention.This trial will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy in alleviating anxiety and depression in cardiac rehabilitation patients. The therapy, if effective, offers the potential to improve psychological wellbeing and quality of life in this large group of patients.UK Clinical Trials Gateway, ISRCTN74643496 , Registered on 8 April 2015."
"Mental illness contributes substantially to global disease burden, particularly when illness onset occurs during youth and help-seeking is delayed and/or limited. Yet, few mental health promotion interventions target youth, particularly those with or at high risk of developing mental illness (""at-risk"" youth). Community-based translational research has the capacity to identify and intervene upon barriers to positive health outcomes. This is especially important for integrated care in at-risk youth populations.Here the Integrated Science Education Outreach (InSciEd Out) program delivered a novel school-based anti-stigma intervention in mental health to a cohort of seventh and eighth grade at-risk students. These students were assessed for changes in mental health knowledge, stigmatization, and help-seeking intentions via a classroom activity, surveys, and teacher interviews. Descriptive statistics and Cohen's d effect sizes were employed to assess pre-post changes. Inferential statistical analyses were also conducted on pilot results to provide a benchmark to inform future studies.Elimination of mental health misconceptions (substance weakness p?=?0.00; recovery p?=?0.05; prevention p?=?0.05; violent p?=?0.05) was accompanied by slight gains in mental health literacy (d?=?0.18) and small to medium improvements in help-seeking intentions (anxiety d?=?0.24; depression d?=?0.48; substance d?=?0.43; psychosis d?=?0.53). Within this particular cohort of students, stigma was exceptionally low at baseline and remained largely unchanged. Teacher narratives revealed positive teacher views of programming, increased student openness to talk about mental illness, and higher peer and self-acceptance of mental health diagnoses and help-seeking.Curricular-based efforts focused on mental illness in an alternative school setting are feasible and integrated well into general curricula under the InSciEd Out framework. Preliminary data suggest the existence of unique help-seeking barriers in at-risk youth. Increased focus upon community-based programming has potential to bridge gaps in translation, bringing this critical population to clinical care in pursuit of improved mental health for all.

"Telocytes (TCs), a recently discovered novel type of interstitial cells, were also found in a wide variety of human and mammalian reproductive organs/tissues, including uterus, oviduct and placenta. Previously, we demonstrated that TCs-conditioned media was capable of activating peritoneal macrophages (pMACs) through paracrine effects. This study investigates the hypothesis that direct interaction of TCs with pMACs will also play a significant role in immunoregulation of pMACs.TCs and pMACs were derived from the uterus and intraperitoneal cavity of female BALB/c mice, respectively. TCs were identified by immunofluorescence and then co-cultured directly with pMACs for 24 h without added cytokines, to observe the in vitro biological behavior of pMACs. We used histochemical staining to study morphology and mitochondrial metabolism of pMACs, scanning electron microscopy to study heterocellular junctions, flow cytometry to investigate mitochondrial membrane potential (??m) and apoptosis, and transwell chambers to study invasion ability. Student-t test was used accordingly.Presently, TCs with typical structure and immunophenotype of double CD-34-positive/vimentin-positive were successfully isolated. pMACs co-cultured with TCs showed obviously morphological activation, with enhanced energy metabolism (P?<?0.05). Meanwhile, direct physical cell-to-cell interaction promoted the development of heterocellular junctions between TCs and pMACs. Furthermore, TCs treatment markedly reduced the depletion of ??m in co-cultured pMACs (all P?<?0.05), and inhibited their apoptosis (P?<?0.05). Functionally, pMACs co-cultured with TCs showed enhanced invasion ability (P?<?0.05).Direct physical cell-to-cell interaction promoted the development of heterocellular junctions between TCs and pMACs, presumably responsible for the observed novel efficient way of pMACs activation via mitochondrial signaling pathway. TCs-educated pMACs might be a promising way to restore the defective immunosurveillance in endometriosis (EMs), led to the enhanced treatment efficacy of EMs in a simple and clinically feasible fashion."
"Vector control is a crucial element of anti-malaria campaigns and works best when there is a thorough knowledge of the biology and behaviour of the Anopheles vector species responsible for transmitting malaria within a given locale. With the push to eradicate malaria stronger than ever, there is a growing need to develop and deploy control strategies that exploit the behavioural attributes of local vector species. This is especially true in regions where the vectors are exophagic (i.e., prefer to bite outdoors), exophilic (i.e., prefer to remain outdoors), and zoophagic (i.e., as likely to feed on non-humans as humans). One promising strategy targeting vectors with these behavioural traits is the administration of avermectin-based endectocides, such as ivermectin, to humans and livestock. When ingested in a blood meal, ivermectin has been shown to reduce mosquito survivorship and fecundity in a number of Anopheles species. In this study, the relative toxicity of ivermectin was compared between two zoophagic, exophilic malaria vectors-Anopheles albimanus and Anopheles stephensi.Toxicity of ivermectin was assessed using membrane feedings, intrathoracic injections, and mosquito feedings on treated mice. When ingested in a blood meal, ivermectin was much less toxic to An. albimanus (4-day oral LC50?=?1468 ng/ml) than to An. stephensi (4-day oral LC50?=?7 ng/ml). However when injected into the haemocoel of An. albimanus, ivermectin was much more toxic (3-day parenteral LC50?=?188 ng/ml). Because the molecular targets of ivermectin (i.e., glutamate-gated chloride channels) reside outside the midgut in nerves and muscles, this suggests that ingested ivermectin was not readily absorbed across the midgut of An. albimanus. In contrast, ivermectin was considerably more toxic to An. stephensi when ingested (4-day oral LC50?=?7 ng/ml) than when injected (3-day parenteral LC50?=?49 ng/ml). This suggests that metabolic by-products from the digestion of ivermectin may play a role in the oral toxicity of ivermectin to An. stephensi. Blood meal digestion and subsequent oviposition rates were significantly hindered in both species by ingested ivermectin but only at concentrations at or above their respective oral LC50concentrations. To test mosquitocidal activity of ivermectin in a live host system, two groups of three mice each received subcutaneous injections of either ivermectin (600 µg/kg BW) or saline (control). One day after injection, the ivermectin-treated mice (n?=?3) exhibited significant mosquitocidal activity against both An. stephensi (85% mortality vs 0% in control-fed) and, to a lesser degree, An. albimanus (44% mortality vs 11% in control-fed). At 3 days, the mosquitocidal activity of ivermectin-treated mice waned and was effective only against An. stephensi (31% mortality vs 3% in control-fed).Ivermectin was not uniformly toxic to both Anopheles species. Previous studies indicate that ivermectin is a good choice of endectocide to use against malaria vectors in southeast Asia and Africa. However, these data suggest that ivermectin may not be the optimal endectocide to use in Central America or the Caribbean where An. albimanus is a major malaria vector species. If endectocides are to be used to help eradicate malaria, then additional efficacy data will be needed to define the activity of specific endectocides against the major malaria vector species of the world."
"Progesterone plays an essential role in mammalian ovulation. Although much is known about this process, the gene networks involved in ovulation have yet to be established. When analyze the mechanisms of ovulation, we often need to determine key genes or pathways to investigate the reproduction features. However, traditional experimental methods have a number of limitations.Data, in this study, were acquired from GSE41836 and GSE54584 which provided different samples. They were analyzed with the GEO2R and 546 differentially expressed genes were obtained from two data sets using bioinformatics (absolute log2FC?>?1, P?<?0.05). This study identified four genes (PGR, RELN, PDE10A and PLA2G4A) by protein-protein interaction networks and pathway analysis, and their functional enrichments were associated with ovulation. Then, the top 25 statistical pathway enrichments related to hCG treatment were analyzed. Furthermore, gene network analysis identified certain interconnected genes and pathways involved in progestogenic mechanisms, including progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, the MAPK signaling pathway, the GnRH signaling pathway and focal adhesion, etc. Moreover, we explored the four target gene pathways. q-PCR analysis following hCG and RU486 treatments confirmed the certain novel progestogenic-associated genes (GNAI1, PRKCA, CAV1, EGFR, RHOA, ZYX, VCL, GRB2 and RAP1A).The results suggested four key genes, nine predicted genes and eight pathways to be involved in progestogenic networks. These networks provide important regulatory genes and signaling pathways which are involved in ovulation. This study provides a fundamental basis for subsequent functional studies to investigate the regulation of mammalian ovulation."
"Kinase inhibition in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a standard therapy for cancer patients with activating BRAF mutations. However, the anti-tumorigenic effect and clinical benefit are only transient, and tumors are prone to treatment resistance and relapse. To elucidate mechanistic insights into drug resistance, we have established an in vitro cellular model of MAPK inhibitor resistance in malignant melanoma.The cellular model evolved in response to clinical dosage of the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, PLX4032. We conducted transcriptomic expression profiling using RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR arrays. Pathways of melanogenesis, MAPK signaling, cell cycle, and metabolism were significantly enriched among the set of differentially expressed genes of vemurafenib-resistant cells vs control. The underlying mechanism of treatment resistance and pathway rewiring was uncovered to be based on non-genomic adaptation and validated in two distinct melanoma models, SK-MEL-28 and A375. Both cell lines have activating BRAF mutations and display metastatic potential.Downregulation of dual specific phosphatases, tumor suppressors, and negative MAPK regulators reengages mitogenic signaling. Upregulation of growth factors, cytokines, and cognate receptors triggers signaling pathways circumventing BRAF blockage. Further, changes in amino acid and one-carbon metabolism support cellular proliferation despite MAPK inhibitor treatment. In addition, treatment-resistant cells upregulate pigmentation and melanogenesis, pathways which partially overlap with MAPK signaling. Upstream regulator analysis discovered significant perturbation in oncogenic forkhead box and hypoxia inducible factor family transcription factors.The established cellular models offer mechanistic insight into cellular changes and therapeutic targets under inhibitor resistance in malignant melanoma. At a systems biology level, the MAPK pathway undergoes major rewiring while acquiring inhibitor resistance. The outcome of this transcriptional plasticity is selection for a set of transcriptional master regulators, which circumvent upstream targeted kinases and provide alternative routes of mitogenic activation. A fine-woven network of redundant signals maintains similar effector genes allowing for tumor cell survival and malignant progression in therapy-resistant cancer."
"Localised patterns of species diversity can be influenced by many factors, including regional species pools, biogeographic features and interspecific interactions. Despite recognition of these issues, we still know surprisingly little about how invertebrate biodiversity is structured across geographic scales. In particular, there have been few studies of how insect communities vary geographically while using the same plant host. We compared the composition (species, genera) and functional structure (guilds) of the chalcid wasp communities associated with the widespread fig tree, Ficus benjamina, towards the northern (Hainan province, China) and southern (Queensland, Australia) edges of its natural range. Sequence data were generated for nuclear and mtDNA markers and used to delimit species, and Bayesian divergence analyses were used to test patterns of community cohesion through evolutionary time.Both communities host at least 14 fig wasp species, but no species are shared across continents. Community composition is similar at the genus level, with six genera shared although some differ in species diversity between China and Australia; a further three genera occur in only China or Australia. Community functional structure remains very similar in terms of numbers of species in each ecological guild despite community composition differing a little (genera) or a lot (species), depending on taxonomic level. Bayesian clustering analyses favour a single community divergence event across continents over multiple events for different ecological guilds. Molecular dating estimates of lineage splits between nearest inter-continental species pairs are broadly consistent with a scenario of synchronous community divergence from a shared ""ancestral community"".Fig wasp community structure and genus-level composition are largely conserved in a wide geographic comparison between China and Australia. Moreover, dating analyses suggest that the functional community structure has remained stable for long periods during historic range expansions. This suggests that ecological interactions between species may play a persistent role in shaping these communities, in contrast to findings in some comparable temperate systems."
"Given the current prevalence of both cigarette use and obesity in the United States, identification of dietary patterns that reduce mortality risk are important public health priorities. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between cigarette use and dietary energy density, a marker for diet quality, in a population of current smokers, former smokers, and never smokers.Data from a nationally representative sample of 5293 adults who participated in the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) were analyzed. Specific survey procedures were used in the analysis to account for sample weights, unequal selection probability, and clustered design when evaluating the association between dietary energy density (ED, energy per weight of food, kcal/g) and current smoking status. Never smokers reported <?100 lifetime cigarettes. Smokers were identified as individuals reporting >?100 lifetime cigarettes and current smoking status was recorded as daily, some days (nondaily), or not at all (former).A strong linear relationship was observed between smoking pattern and dietary ED in current smokers. Compared to never smokers, daily smokers and nondaily smokers have significantly higher dietary ED (1.79 vs. 2.02 and 1.88, respectively; both p?<?0.05); demonstrating that any amount of current cigarette consumption is associated with poor diet. Though former smokers had a higher dietary ED than never smokers, this difference still significantly lower than that of current smokers (p?=?0.002).These findings suggest that smoking status is associated with poor diet quality. Former smokers had a slightly lower ED value (1.84) than current non-daily smokers (1.89) but a higher value than never smokers (1.79)."
"Tumors comprise a variety of specialized cell phenotypes adapted to different ecological niches that massively influence the tumor growth and its response to treatment.In the background of glioblastoma multiforme, a highly malignant brain tumor, we consider a rapid proliferating phenotype that appears susceptible to treatment, and a dormant phenotype which lacks this pronounced proliferative ability and is not affected by standard therapeutic strategies. To gain insight in the dynamically changing proportions of different tumor cell phenotypes under different treatment conditions, we develop a mathematical model and underline our assumptions with experimental data.We show that both cell phenotypes contribute to the distinct composition of the tumor, especially in cycling low and high dose treatment, and therefore may influence the tumor growth in a phenotype specific way.Our model of the dynamic proportions of dormant and rapidly growing glioblastoma cells in different therapy settings suggests that phenotypically different cells should be considered to plan dose and duration of treatment schedules."
"Energy (resources) acquired by animals should be allocated towards competing demands, maintenance, growth, reproduction and fat storage. Reproduction has the second lowest priority in energy allocation and only is allowed after meeting the energetic demands for maintenance and growth. This hierarchical allocation of energy suggests the hypothesis that species or taxa with high maintenance costs would be less likely to invest more energy in reproduction or to evolve an energetically more expensive mode of reproduction. Here, we used data on standard metabolic rate so far reported for 196 species of squamates to test this hypothesis.We found that maintenance costs were lower in snakes than in lizards, and that the costs were lower in viviparous species than in oviparous species. As snakes generally invest more energy per reproductive episode than lizards, and viviparity is an energetically more expensive mode of reproduction than oviparity, our results are consistent with the hypothesis tested.The transition from lizard-like to snake-like body form and the transition from oviparity to viviparity are major evolutionary transitions in vertebrates, which likely alter many aspects of biology of the organisms involved. Our study is the first to demonstrate that evolutionary transitions in body plan and reproductive mode alter maintenance metabolism in squamates."
"Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease in China and occurs mostly in infants and children. Beijing is a densely populated megacity, in which HFMD has been increasing in the last decade. The aim of this study was to quantify spatio-temporal characteristics of HFMD and the relationship between meteorological factors and HFMD incidence in Beijing, China.Daily counts of HFMD cases from January 2010 to December 2012 were obtained from the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC). Seasonal trend decomposition with Loess smoothing was used to explore seasonal patterns and temporal trends of HFMD. Bayesian spatiotemporal Poisson regression models were used to quantify spatiotemporal patterns of HFMD incidence and associations with meteorological factors.There were 114,777 HFMD cases reported to Beijing CDC from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012 and the raw incidence was 568.6 per 100,000 people. May to July was the peak period of HFMD incidence each year. Low-incidence townships were clustered in central, northeast and southwest regions of Beijing. Mean temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity and sunshine hours were all positively associated with HFMD. The effect of wind velocity was significant with a RR of 3.30 (95%CI: 2.37, 4.60) per meter per second increase, as was sunshine hours with a RR of 1.20 (95%CI: 1.02, 1.40) per 1 hour increase.The distribution of HFMD in Beijing was spatiotemporally heterogeneous, and was associated with meteorological factors. Meteorological monitoring could be incorporated into prediction and surveillance of HFMD in Beijing."
"The ability to imitate the vocalizations of other organisms, a trait known as vocal learning, is shared by only a few organisms, including humans, where it subserves the acquisition of speech and language, and 3 groups of birds. In songbirds, vocal learning requires the coordinated activity of a set of specialized brain nuclei referred to as the song control system. Recent efforts have revealed some of the genes that are expressed in these vocal nuclei, however a thorough characterization of the transcriptional specializations of this system is still missing. We conducted a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of microarrays, and conducted a separate analysis of 380 genes by in situ hybridizations in order to identify molecular specializations of the major nuclei of the song system of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), a songbird species.Our efforts identified more than 3300 genes that are differentially regulated in one or more vocal nuclei of adult male birds compared to the adjacent brain regions. Bioinformatics analyses provided insights into the possible involvement of these genes in molecular pathways such as cellular morphogenesis, intrinsic cellular excitability, neurotransmission and neuromodulation, axonal guidance and cela-to-cell interactions, and cell survival, which are known to strongly influence the functional properties of the song system. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of specific gene families with known involvement in regulating the development and physiological properties of neuronal circuits provides further insights into possible modulators of the song system.Our study represents one of the most comprehensive molecular characterizations of a brain circuit that evolved to facilitate a learned behavior in a vertebrate. The data provide novel insights into possible molecular determinants of the functional properties of the song control circuitry. It also provides lists of compelling targets for pharmacological and genetic manipulations to elucidate the molecular regulation of song behavior and vocal learning."
"The experimental approach to the evolution and development of the vertebrate skeleton has to a large extent relied on ""direct-developing"" amniote model organisms, such as the mouse and the chicken. These organisms can however only be partially informative where it concerns secondarily lost features or anatomical novelties not present in their lineages. The widely used anamniotes Xenopus and zebrafish are ""indirect-developing"" organisms that proceed through an extended time as free-living larvae, before adopting many aspects of their adult morphology, complicating experiments at these stages, and increasing the risk for lethal pleiotropic effects using genetic strategies.Here, we provide a detailed description of the development of the osteology of the African mouthbrooding cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, primarily focusing on the trunk (spinal column, ribs and epicentrals) and the appendicular skeleton (pectoral, pelvic, dorsal, anal, caudal fins and scales), and to a lesser extent on the cranium. We show that this species has an extremely ""direct"" mode of development, attains an adult body plan within 2 weeks after fertilization while living off its yolk supply only, and does not pass through a prolonged larval period.As husbandry of this species is easy, generation time is short, and the species is amenable to genetic targeting strategies through microinjection, we suggest that the use of this direct-developing cichlid will provide a valuable model system for the study of the vertebrate body plan, particularly where it concerns the evolution and development of fish or teleost specific traits. Based on our results we comment on the development of the homocercal caudal fin, on shared ontogenetic patterns between pectoral and pelvic girdles, and on the evolution of fin spines as novelty in acanthomorph fishes. We discuss the differences between ""direct"" and ""indirect"" developing actinopterygians using a comparison between zebrafish and A. burtoni development."
"Among semi-aquatic species of the legume genus Aeschynomene, some have the unique property of being root and stem-nodulated by photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium lacking the nodABC genes necessary for the production of Nod factors. These species provide an excellent biological system with which to explore the evolution of nodulation in legumes. Among them, Aeschynomene evenia has emerged as a model legume to undertake the genetic dissection of the so-called Nod-independent symbiosis. In addition to the genetic analysis of nodulation on a reference line, natural variation in a germplasm collection could also be surveyed to uncover genetic determinants of nodulation. To this aim, we investigated the patterns of genetic diversity in a collection of 226 Nod-independent Aeschynomene accessions.A combination of phylogenetic analyses, comprising ITS and low-copy nuclear genes, along with cytogenetic experiments and artificial hybridizations revealed the richness of the Nod-independent Aeschynomene group with the identification of 13 diploid and 6 polyploid well-differentiated taxa. A set of 54 SSRs was used to further delineate taxon boundaries and to identify different genotypes. Patterns of microsatellite diversity also illuminated the genetic basis of the Aeschynomene taxa that were all found to be predominantly autogamous and with a predicted simple disomic inheritance, two attributes favorable for genetics. In addition, taxa displaying a pronounced genetic diversity, notably A. evenia, A. indica and A. sensitiva, were characterized by a clear geographically-based genetic structure and variations in root and stem nodulation.A well-characterized germplasm collection now exists as a major genetic resource to thoroughly explore the natural variation of nodulation in response to different bradyrhizobial strains. Symbiotic polymorphisms are expected to be found notably in the induction of nodulation, in nitrogen fixation and also in stem nodulation. Subsequent genetic analysis and locus mapping will pave the way for the identification of the underlying genes through forward or reverse genetics. Such discoveries will significantly contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning how some Aeschynomene species can be efficiently nodulated in a Nod-independent fashion."
"DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification critical in regulation and transgenerational inheritance. The methylation level can be estimated at single-nucleotide resolution by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq; WGBS). Current bisulfite aligners provide pipelines for processing the reads by WGBS; however, few are able to analyze the BS-seqs in a reasonable timeframe that meets the needs of the rapid expansion of epigenome sequencing in biomedical research.We introduce BS-Seeker3, an extensively improved and optimized implementation of BS-Seeker2 that leverages the available computational power of a standard bioinformatics lab. BS-Seeker3 adopts all alignment features of BS-Seeker2. It performs ultrafast alignments and achieves both high accuracy and high mappability, more than twice that of the other aligners that we evaluated. Moreover, BS Seeker 3 is well linked with downstream analyzer MethGo for up to 9 types of genomic and epigenomic analyses.BS-Seeker3 is an accurate, versatile, ultra-fast pipeline for processing bisulfite-converted reads. It also helps the user better visualize the methylation data."
"Sugarcane bagasse has been proposed as a lignocellulosic residue for second-generation ethanol (2G) produced by breaking down biomass into fermentable sugars. The enzymatic cocktails for biomass degradation are mostly produced by fungi, but low cost and high efficiency can consolidate 2G technologies. A. fumigatus plays an important role in plant biomass degradation capabilities and recycling. To gain more insight into the divergence in gene expression during steam-exploded bagasse (SEB) breakdown, this study profiled the transcriptome of A. fumigatus by RNA sequencing to compare transcriptional profiles of A. fumigatus grown on media containing SEB or fructose as the sole carbon source. Secretome analysis was also performed using SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS.The maximum activities of cellulases (0.032 U mL-1), endo-1,4-?--xylanase (10.82 U mL-1) and endo-1,3-? glucanases (0.77 U mL-1) showed that functional CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes) were secreted in the SEB culture conditions. Correlations between transcriptome and secretome data identified several CAZymes in A. fumigatus. Particular attention was given to CAZymes related to lignocellulose degradation and sugar transporters. Genes encoding glycoside hydrolase classes commonly expressed during the breakdown of cellulose, such as GH-5, 6, 7, 43, 45, and hemicellulose, such as GH-2, 10, 11, 30, 43, were found to be highly expressed in SEB conditions. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMO) classified as auxiliary activity families AA9 (GH61), CE (1, 4, 8, 15, 16), PL (1, 3, 4, 20) and GT (1, 2, 4, 8, 20, 35, 48) were also differentially expressed in this condition. Similarly, the most important enzymes related to biomass degradation, including endoxylanases, xyloglucanases, ?-xylosidases, LPMOs, ?-arabinofuranosidases, cellobiohydrolases, endoglucanases and ?-glucosidases, were also identified in the secretome.This is the first report of a transcriptome and secretome experiment of Aspergillus fumigatus in the degradation of pretreated sugarcane bagasse. The results suggest that this strain employs important strategies for this complex degradation process. It was possible to identify a set of genes and proteins that might be applied in several biotechnology fields. This knowledge can be exploited for the improvement of 2G ethanol production by the rational design of enzymatic cocktails."
"Immunoglobulin replacement therapy, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), is essential for pregnant women with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) since it prevents infection and improves the health of the newborn. There are no established IVIG treatment protocols for pregnant women with CVID, and the relationship between IVIG treatment and maternal serum IgG changes during pregnancy remains unclear. Therefore, we reviewed the medical charts of four CVID patients, including one receiving subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG), for IVIG dose and frequency, maternal serum IgG changes, obstetrical findings, and perinatal outcomes. There were no serious infections but one abortion and all patients continued therapy without IVIG-related adverse events. All eight children born to the patients were healthy at one month. However, the IVIG efficiency in those with CVID significantly decreased with progression of the gestational period, suggesting that IVIG dose and frequency may be changed during pregnancy to maintain stable serum IgG trough levels in women with CVID."
"Synthetic polymers, nanoparticles, and carbon-based materials have great potential in applications including drug delivery, gene transfection, in vitro and in vivo imaging, and the alteration of biological function. Nature and humans use different design strategies to create nanomaterials: biological objects have emerged from billions of years of evolution and from adaptation to their environment resulting in high levels of structural complexity; in contrast, synthetic nanomaterials result from minimalistic but controlled design options limited by the authors' current understanding of the biological world. This conceptual mismatch makes it challenging to create synthetic nanomaterials that possess desired functions in biological media. In many biologically relevant applications, nanomaterials must enter the cell interior to perform their functions. An essential transport barrier is the cell-protecting plasma membrane and hence the understanding of its interaction with nanomaterials is a fundamental task in biotechnology. The authors present open questions in the field of nanomaterial interactions with biological membranes, including: how physical mechanisms and molecular forces acting at the nanoscale restrict or inspire design options; which levels of complexity to include next in computational and experimental models to describe how nanomaterials cross barriers via passive or active processes; and how the biological media and protein corona interfere with nanomaterial functionality. In this Perspective, the authors address these questions with the aim of offering guidelines for the development of next-generation nanomaterials that function in biological media."
"                    Piscine orthoreovirus
(PRV-1) causes heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Recently, a novel PRV (formerly PRV-Om, here called PRV-3), was found in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with HSMI-like disease. PRV is considered to be an emerging pathogen in farmed salmonids. In this study, molecular and antigenic characterization of PRV-3 was performed. Erythrocytes are the main target cells for PRV, and blood samples that were collected from experimentally challenged fish were used as source of virus. Virus particles were purified by gradient ultracentrifugation and the complete coding sequences of PRV-3 were obtained by Illumina sequencing. When compared to PRV-1, the nucleotide identity of the coding regions was 80.1%, and the amino acid identities of the predicted PRV-3 proteins varied from 96.7% (?1) to 79.1% (?3). Phylogenetic analysis showed that PRV-3 belongs to a separate cluster. The region encoding ?3 were sequenced from PRV-3 isolates collected from rainbow trout in Europe. These sequences clustered together, but were distant from PRV-3 that was isolated from rainbow trout in Norway. Bioinformatic analyses of PRV-3 proteins revealed that predicted secondary structures and functional domains were conserved between PRV-3 and PRV-1. Rabbit antisera raised against purified virus or various recombinant virus proteins from PRV-1 all cross-reacted with PRV-3. Our findings indicate that despite different species preferences of the PRV subtypes, several genetic, antigenic, and structural properties are conserved between PRV-1 and-3."
"Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of phytohormones that regulate plant architecture.Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase(CCD) genes are involved in the biosynthesis of SLs and are identified and characterized in many plants. However, the function ofCCDgenes in tobacco remains poorly understood. In this study, two closely related genesNtCCD8AandNtCCD8Bwere cloned from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacumL.). The twoNtCCD8genes are orthologues of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum)carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase8 (SlCCD8) gene.NtCCD8AandNtCCD8Bwere primarily expressed in tobacco roots, but low expression levels of these genes were detected in all plant tissues, and their transcript levels significantly increased in response to phosphate limitation.NtCCD8AandNtCCD8Bmutations were introduced into tobacco using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and transgenic tobacco lines for bothntccd8mutant alleles were identified. Thentccd8aandntccd8bmutant alleles were inactivated by a deletion of three nucleotides and insertion of one nucleotide, respectively, both of which led to the production of premature stop codons. Thentccd8mutants had increased shoot branching, reduced plant height, increased number of leaves and nodes, and reduced total plant biomass compared to wild-type plants; however, the root-to-shoot ratio was unchanged. In addition, mutant lines had shorter primary roots and more of lateral roots than wild type. These results suggest thatNtCCD8genes are important for changes in tobacco plant architecture."
"Lake Lesser Prespa and its adjacent pond, Vromolimni in Greece, is a shallow freshwater system and a highly protected area hosting an exceptional biodiversity. The occurrence of microcystins (MCs) producing cyanobacterial blooms in these waters during recent years can be harmful to the wildlife. We tested the hypothesis that both cyanobacterial biomass and MCs are strongly influenced by nutrients (eutrophication) and warming (climate change). Lake and pond water was collected from two sites in each water body in 2013 and incubated at three temperatures (20 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C) with or without additional nutrients (nitrogen +N, phosphorus +P and both +N and +P). Based on both biovolume and chlorophyll-a concentrations, cyanobacteria in water from Lesser Prespa were promoted primarily by combined N and P additions and to a lesser extent by N alone. Warming seemed to yield more cyanobacteria biomass in these treatments. In water from Vromolimni, both N alone and N+P additions increased cyanobacteria and a warming effect was hardly discernible. MC concentrations were strongly increased by N and N+P additions in water from all four sites, which also promoted the more toxic variant MC-LR. Hence, both water bodies seem particularly vulnerable to further N-loading enhancing MC related risks."
"Brazil is one of the major passion fruit producers worldwide. Viral diseases are among the most important constraints for passion fruit production. Here we identify and characterize a new passion fruit infecting-virus belonging to the familyGeminiviridae: passion fruit chlorotic mottle virus (PCMoV). PCMoV is a divergent geminivirus unlike previously characterized passion fruit-infecting geminiviruses that belonged to the genusBegomovirus. Among the presently known geminiviruses, it is most closely related to, and shares ~62% genome-wide identity with citrus chlorotic dwarf associated virus (CCDaV) and camelia chlorotic dwarf associated virus (CaCDaV). The 3743 nt PCMoV genome encodes a capsid protein (CP) and replication-associated protein (Rep) that respectively share 56 and 60% amino acid identity with those encoded by CaCDaV. The CPs of PCMoV, CCDaV, and CaCDaV cluster with those of begomovirus whereas their Reps with those of becurtoviruses. Hence, these viruses likely represent a lineage of recombinant begomo-like and becurto-like ancestral viruses. Furthermore, PCMoV, CCDaV, and CaCDaV genomes are ~12-30% larger than monopartite geminiviruses and this is primarily due to the encoded movement protein (MP; 891-921 nt) and this MP is most closely related to that encoded by the DNA-B component of bipartite begomoviruses. Hence, PCMoV, CCDaV, and CaCDaV lineage of viruses may represent molecules in an intermediary step in the evolution of bipartite begomoviruses (~5.3 kb) from monopartite geminiviruses (~2.7-3 kb). An infectious clone of PCMoV systemically infectedNicotiana benthamina,Arabidopsis thaliana, andPassiflora edulis."
"The therapeutic effects of voluntary exercise on the recovery of long-gap nerve injury following the bridging of an acellular conduit filled with human skeletal muscle-derived stem cells (Sk-SCs) have been described. Human Sk-SCs were sorted as CD34?/45-(Sk-34) cells, then cultured/expanded under optimal conditions for 2 weeks. Surgery to generate a long-gap sciatic nerve injury was performed in athymic nude mice, after which the mice were divided into exercise (E) and non-exercise (NE) groups. The mice were housed in standard individual cages, and voluntary exercise wheels were introduced to the cages of the E group one week after surgery. After 8 weeks, the human Sk-34 cells were actively engrafted, and showed differentiation into Schwann cells and perineurial cells, in both groups. The recovery in the number of axons and myelin in the conduit and downstream tibial nerve branches, and the lower hindlimb muscle mass and their tension output, was consistently higher by 15-25% in the E group. Moreover, a significantly higher innervation ratio of muscle spindles, reduced pathological muscle fiber area, and acceleration of blood vessel formation in the conduit were each observed in the E group. These results showed that the combined therapy of tube-bridging, Sk-34 cell transplantation, and voluntary exercise is a potentially practical approach for recovery following long-gap nerve injury."
"Substantial fraction of high-quality information is continuously being added into the existing pool of knowledge related to the biology of telomeres. Based on the insights gleaned from decades of research, it is clear that chromosomal stability needs a highly controlled and dynamic balance of DNA gain and loss in each terminal tract of telomeric repeats. Telomeres are formed by tandem repeats of TTAGGG sequences, which are gradually lost with each round of division of the cells. Targeted inhibition of telomerase to effectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells has attracted tremendous attention and overwhelmingly increasingly list of telomerase inhibitors truthfully advocates pharmacological significance of telomerase. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is a multi-talented and catalytically active component of the telomerase-associated protein machinery. Different proteins of telomerase-associated machinery work in a synchronized and orchestrated manner to ensure proper maintenance of telomeric length of chromosomes. Rapidly emerging scientific findings about regulation of TERT by microRNAs has revolutionized our understanding related to the biology of telomeres and telomerase. In this review, we have comprehensively discussed how different miRNAs regulate TERT in different cancers. Use of miRNA-based therapeutics against TERT in different cancers needs detailed research in preclinical models for effective translation of laboratory findings to clinically effective therapeutics."
"Compared to traditional DNA markers, genome-scale datasets can provide mass information to effectively address historically difficult phylogenies.Primulais the largest genus in the family Primulaceae, with members distributed mainly throughout temperate and arctic areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The phylogenetic relationships amongPrimulataxa still maintain unresolved, mainly due to intra- and interspecific morphological variation, which was caused by frequent hybridization and introgression. In this study, we sequenced and assembled four complete plastid genomes (Primula handeliana,Primula woodwardii,Primula knuthiana, andAndrosace laxa) by Illumina paired-end sequencing. A total of 10Primulaspecies (including 7 published plastid genomes) were analyzed to investigate the plastid genome sequence divergence and their inferences for the phylogeny ofPrimula. The 10Primulaplastid genomes were similar in terms of their gene content and order, GC content, and codon usage, but slightly different in the number of the repeat. Moderate sequence divergence was observed amongPrimulaplastid genomes. Phylogenetic analysis strongly supported thatPrimulawas monophyletic and more closely related toAndrosacein the Primulaceae family. The phylogenetic relationships among the 10Primulaspecies showed that the placement ofP. knuthiana-P. verisclade was uncertain in the phylogenetic tree. This study indicated that plastid genome data were highly effective to investigate the phylogeny."
"RpoN (or ?54) is the key sigma factor for the regulation of transcription of nitrogen fixation genes in diazotrophic bacteria, which include ?- and ?-rhizobia. Our previous studies showed that anrpoNmutant of the ?-rhizobial strainParaburkholderia phymatumSTM815Tformed root nodules onPhaseolus vulgariscv. Negro jamapa, which were unable to reduce atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia. In an effort to further characterize the RpoN regulon ofP. phymatum, transcriptomics was combined with a powerful metabolomics approach. The metabolome ofP. vulgarisroot nodules infected by aP. phymatumrpoNFix-mutant revealed statistically significant metabolic changes compared to wild-type Fix? nodules, including reduced amounts of chorismate and elevated levels of flavonoids. A transcriptome analysis on Fix-and Fix? nodules-combined with a search for RpoN binding sequences in promoter regions of regulated genes-confirmed the expected control of ?54on nitrogen fixation genes in nodules. The transcriptomic data also allowed us to identify additional target genes, whose differential expression was able to explain the observed metabolite changes in numerous cases. Moreover, the genes encoding the two-component regulatory system NtrBC were downregulated in root nodules induced by therpoNmutant, and contained a putative RpoN binding motif in their promoter region, suggesting direct regulation. The construction and characterization of anntrBmutant strain revealed impaired nitrogen assimilation in free-living conditions, as well as a noticeable symbiotic phenotype, as fewer but heavier nodules were formed onP. vulgarisroots."
"                    Trypanosoma brucei
, as well asTrypanosoma cruziand more than 20 species of the genusLeishmania, form a group of flagellated protists that threaten human health. These organisms are transmitted by insects that, together with mammals, are their natural hosts. This implies that during their life cycles each of them faces environments with different physical, chemical, biochemical, and biological characteristics. In this work we review how amino acids are obtained from such environments, how they are metabolized, and how they and some of their intermediate metabolites are used as a survival toolbox to cope with the different conditions in which these parasites should establish the infections in the insects and mammalian hosts."
"The brain and the gut are connected from early fetal life. The mother's exposure to microbial molecules is thought to exert in utero developmental effects on the fetus. These effects could importantly underpin the groundwork for subsequent pathophysiological mechanisms for achieving immunological tolerance and metabolic equilibrium post birth, events that continue through to 3-4 years of age. Furthermore, it is understood that the microbiome promotes cues that instruct the neonate's mucosal tissues and skin in the language of molecular and cellular biology. Post birth mucosal lymphoid tissue formation and maturation (most probably including the vermiform appendix) is microbiota-encouraged co-establishing the intestinal microbiome with a developing immune system. Intestinal mucosal tissue maturation loops the brain-gut-brain and is postulated to influence mood dispositions via shifts in the intestinal microbiome phyla. A plausible appreciation is that dysregulated pro-inflammatory signals from intestinal resident macrophages could breach the loop by providing adverse mood signals via vagus nerve afferents to the brain. In this commentary, we further suggest that the intestinal resident macrophages act as an upstream traffic controller of translocated microbes and metabolites in order to maintain local neuro-endocrine-immunological equilibrium. When macrophages are overwhelmed through intestinal microbiome and intestinal epithelial cell dysbiosis, pro-inflammatory signals are sustained, which may then lead to mood disorders. The administration of probiotics as an adjunctive medicine co-administered with antidepressant medications in improving depressed mood may have biological and clinical standing."
"?-glucans are derived from a variety of sources including yeast, grain and fungus and belong to the class of drugs known as biological response modifiers. They possess a broad spectrum of biological activities that enhance immunity in humans. One promising area for ?-glucans' application is dermatology, including wound care. Topical applications of ?-glucans are increasing, especially due to their pluripotent properties. Macrophages, keratinocytes and fibroblasts are considered the main target cells of ?-glucans during wound healing. ?-glucans enhance wound repair by increasing the infiltration of macrophages, which stimulates tissue granulation, collagen deposition and reepithelialization. ?-glucan wound dressings represent a suitable wound healing agent, with great stability and resistance to wound proteases. This review summarizes the current knowledge and progress made on characterizing ?-glucans' wound healing properties in vitro and in vivo and their safety and efficacy in managing non-healing wounds or other chronic dermatological conditions and diseases."
"Viruses have a dual nature: particles are &ldquo;passive substances&rdquo; lacking chemical energy transformation, whereas infected cells are &ldquo;active substances&rdquo; turning-over energy. How passive viral substances convert to active substances, comprising viral replication and assembly compartments has been of intense interest to virologists, cell and molecular biologists and immunologists. Infection starts with virus entry into a susceptible cell and delivers the viral genome to the replication site. This is a multi-step process, and involves the cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins. Likewise, the egress of progeny virus particles from the replication site to the extracellular space is enhanced by the cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins. This overcomes the limitation of thermal diffusion, and transports virions and virion components, often in association with cellular organelles. This review explores how the analysis of viral trajectories informs about mechanisms of infection. We discuss the methodology enabling researchers to visualize single virions in cells by fluorescence imaging and tracking. Virus visualization and tracking are increasingly enhanced by computational analyses of virus trajectories as well as in silico modeling. Combined approaches reveal previously unrecognized features of virus-infected cells. Using select examples of complementary methodology, we highlight the role of actin filaments and microtubules, and their associated motors in virus infections. In-depth studies of single virion dynamics at high temporal and spatial resolutions thereby provide deep insight into virus infection processes, and are a basis for uncovering underlying mechanisms of how cells function."
"Chemical investigation of the marine algal-derived endophytic fungusAspergillus alabamensisEN-547 resulted in the isolation of 4-epi-seco-shornephine A methyl ester (1) and 4-epi-seco-shornephine A carboxylic acid (2), two new secondary metabolites having a rare diketomorpholine motif, and 28-acetoxy-12?,15?,25-trihydroxyergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (3), a new highly conjugated ergostane-type steroid, together with four known metabolites (4-7). Their chemical structures were elucidated by detailed analysis of their NMR spectra, ECDs, HRESIMS, optical rotation, and X-ray crystallographic data, and by comparison with literature data as well. The antimicrobial activities of compounds1-7were evaluated."
"Non-transfusional hemocomponents for surgical use are autogenous products prepared through the centrifugation of a blood sample from a patient. Their potential beneficial outcomes include hard and soft tissue regeneration, local hemostasis, and the acceleration of wound healing. Therefore, they are suitable for application in different medical fields as therapeutic options and in surgical practices that require tissue regeneration."
"When nerve transection is performed on adult rodents, a substantial population of neurons survives short-term disconnection from target, and the immune system supports this neuronal survival, however long-term survival remains unknown. Understanding the effects of permanent axotomy on cell body survival is important as target disconnection is the first pathological occurrence in fatal motoneuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).The goal of this study was to determine if facial motoneurons (FMN) could survive permanent target disconnection up to 26 weeks post-operation (wpo) after facial nerve axotomy (FNA). In addition, the potentially additive effects of immunodeficiency and motoneuron disease on post-axotomy FMN survival were examined.This study included three wild type (WT) mouse strains (C57BL/6J, B6SJL, and FVB/NJ) and three experimental models (RAG-2-/-: immunodeficiency; mSOD1: ALS; Smn-/-/SMN2+/+: SMA). All animals received a unilateral FNA, and FMN survival was quantified at early and extended post-operative timepoints.In the C57BL/6J WT group, FMN survival significantly decreased at 10 wpo (55±6%), and then remained stable out to 26 wpo (47±6%). In the RAG-2-/- and mSOD1 groups, FMN death occurred much earlier at 4 wpo, and survival plateaued at approximately 50% at 10 wpo. The SMA model and other WT strains also exhibited approximately 50% FMN survival after FNA.These results indicate that immunodeficiency and motoneuron disease accelerate axotomy-induced neuron death, but do not increase total neuron death in the context of permanent target disconnection. This consistent finding of a target disconnection-resilient motoneuron population is prevalent in other peripheral nerve injury models and in neurodegenerative disease models as well. Characterization of the distinct populations of vulnerable and resilient motoneurons may reveal new therapeutic approaches for injury and disease."
"Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) promote recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) using adult bone marrow MSC (BM-MSC). Newborn tissues are a convenient source of MSC that does not involve an invasive procedure for cell collection. In this study the authors tested the effects of rat amnion MSC clone (rAM-MSC) in SCI.We tested intra-parenchymal injection of a GFP+ rat rAM-MSC clone derived from E18.5 rats in rat SCI and measured behavioral recovery (BBB scores), histology and X-ray opacity. Expression of aggrecan was measured in culture after treatment with TGFß.Injection of rAM-MSC after SCI did not improve BBB scores compared to control vehicle injections; rather they reduced scores significantly over 6 weeks. Spinal cords injected with rAM-MSC were hard in regions surrounding the SCI site, which was confirmed by X-ray opacity. Whole mount imaging of these cords showed minimal tissue loss in the SCI site that occurred in SCI controls, and persistence of GFP+ rAM-MSC. Mason's Trichrome staining of tissue sections showed more intense staining for extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding and extending beyond the SCI site with injections of rAM-MSC but not in controls. In response to TGF-ß treatment in culture, chondrogenic aggrecan was expressed at higher levels in rAM-MSC than in rBM-MSC, suggesting that the upregulation of TGF-ß in SCI sites may promote chondrogenic differentiation.Acute injection after SCI of a clonally expanded rAM-MSC resulted in aberrant differentiation towards a chondrocytic phenotype that disrupts the spinal cord and inhibits behavioral recovery after SCI. It will be critical to ensure that injection of extensively expanded neonatal cells do not differentiate aberrantly in traumatic CNS tissue and disrupt recovery."
"There is an unmet clinical need for objective biomarkers to monitor disease progression and treatment response in Huntington's disease (HD). The aim of this review is, therefore, to provide practical advice for biomarker discovery and to summarise studies on biofluid markers for HD. A PubMed search was performed to review literature with regard to candidate saliva, urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for HD. Information has been organised into tables to allow a pragmatic approach to the discussion of the evidence and generation of practical recommendations for future studies. Many of the markers published converge on metabolic and inflammatory pathways, although changes in other analytes representing antioxidant and growth factor pathways have also been found. The most promising markers reflect neuronal and glial degeneration, particularly neurofilament light chain. International collaboration to standardise assays and study protocols, as well as to recruit sufficiently large cohorts, will facilitate future biomarker discovery and development."
"Impairment of cerebral glucose uptake/metabolism in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is believed to lead to downregulation of protein O-GlcNAcylation, which contributes to tau pathogenesis through tau hyperphosphorylation. Level of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), a neuronal specific glucose transporter, is decreased in AD brain, which may contribute to impaired brain glucose uptake/metabolism. However, what causes the reduction of GLUT3 in AD brain is not fully understood. Here, we report 1) that decrease of GLUT3 is associated with the reduction of protein O-GlcNAcylation in AD brain, 2) that GLUT3 level is negatively correlated with calpain I activation in human brain, 3) that calpain I proteolyzes GLUT3 at the N-terminus in vitro, and 4) that activation of calpain I is negatively correlated with protein O-GlcNAcylation in AD brain. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of GLUT3 enhances protein O-GlcNAcylation in N2a cells. Overexpression of calpain I suppresses protein O-GlcNAcylation in these cells. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which calpain I overactivation leads to GLUT3 degradation and the consequent down-regulation of protein O-GlcNAcylation in AD brain."
"The microtubule associated protein tau in a hyperphosphorylated form was identified as the building block of the filamentous aggregates found in the neurons of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In the abnormal state, hyperphosphorylated tau from AD brains (AD P-tau) was unable to promote microtubule assembly and more importantly, it could inhibit the normal activity of tau and other MAPs. AD P-tau was able to disrupt preformed microtubules and, by binding to normal tau, turn the latter into an AD P-tau like molecule. AD P-tau toxic behavior was prevalent in the soluble form and it was lost upon dephosphorylation. Mutations on tau associated with disease, e.g., R406W in frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, altered its conformation to make it a better substrate for kinases. Using phospho-mimetics, it was found that the minimum phospho-sites necessary to acquire such a toxic behavior of tau were at 199, 212, 231 and 262, and tau pseudophosphorylated at those sites in combination with R406W was named Pathological Human Tau (PH-Tau). PH-Tau expressed in cells had similar behavior to AD P-tau: disruption of the microtubule system, change in the normal subcellular localization, and gain of toxic function for cells. In animal models expressing PH-Tau, it was found that two putative mechanisms of neurodegeneration exist depending on the concentration of the toxic protein, both involving cognitive decline, due to synaptic dysfunction at lower concentration and neuronal death at higher. Studies investigating the mechanism of tau pathology and its transmission from neuron to neuron are currently ongoing."
"In the study, we examined whether the silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) can attenuate oxidative stress in the brains of mice carrying the APP/PS1 double mutation and/or in primary neonatal rat neurons exposed to oligomers of amyloid-? peptide (A?Os). Starting at 4 or 8 months of age, the transgenic mice were treated with resveratrol (RSV, a stimulator of SIRT1) or suramin (an inhibitor) (each 20?mg/kg BW/day) for two months. The primary neurons were exposed to A?Os (0.5 ?M) for 48?h and thereafter RSV (20 ?M) or suramin (300?mg/ml) for 24?h. Cell viability was assessed by the CCK-8 assay; SIRT1 protein and mRNA determined by western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively; senile plaques examined immunohistochemically; ROS monitored by flow cytometry; and the contents of OH-, H2O2, O2·-, and MDA, and the activities of SOD and GSH-Px measured by standard biochemical procedures. In comparison to wild-type mice or untreated primary neurons, the expression of SIRT1 was significantly lower in the brains of APP/PS1 mice or neurons exposed to A?Os. In these same systems, increased numbers of senile plaques and a high level of oxidative stress were apparent. Interestingly, these two latter changes were attenuated by treatment with RSV, but enhanced by suramin. These findings indicate that SIRT1 may be neuroprotective."
"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) of the A? type is variably present in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). CAA contributes to cognitive decline and increases the risk of lobar hemorrhage; because both AD-typical dementia and lobar hemorrhage are more common in African-Americans than in Caucasians, we postulated that African-Americans with AD might be particularly susceptible to CAA. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed CAA histopathologically in the large vessels and capillaries of autopsy-derived frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortical samples from African-Americans (n?=?18) and Caucasians (n?=?19) with end-stage AD. In the combined cohort of 37 subjects, 22% of the subjects had severe CAA in large vessels, and 11% had severe CAA in capillaries. However, the prevalence and histopathologic characteristics of CAA were similar in the African-Americans and Caucasians. This conclusion was substantiated in an independent sample from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database, in which the degree of CAA was comparable in 1,554 Caucasians and 68 African-Americans with end-stage AD. These findings support a growing consensus that the fundamental histopathologic features of AD are largely impartial to the race of the afflicted."
"As the primary mediator for synaptic transmission, AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are crucial for synaptic plasticity and higher brain functions. A downregulation of AMPAR expression has been indicated as one of the early pathological molecular alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD), presumably via amyloid-? (A?). However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of AMPARs remain less clear. We report that in primary neurons, application of A? triggers AMPAR internalization accompanied with a decrease in cell-surface AMPAR expression. Importantly, in both A?-treated neurons and human brain tissue from AD patients, we observed a significant decrease in total AMPAR amount and an enhancement in AMPAR ubiquitination. Consistent with facilitated receptor degradation, AMPARs show higher turnover rates in the presence of A?. Furthermore, AD brain lysates and A?-incubated neurons show increased expression of the AMPAR E3 ligase Nedd4 and decreased expression of AMPAR deubiquitinase USP46. Changes in these enzymes are responsible for the A?-dependent AMPAR reduction. These findings indicate that AMPAR ubiquitination acts as the key molecular event leading to the loss of AMPARs and thus suppressed synaptic transmission in AD."
"Chronic activation of coagulation is one of the features of sickle cell disease (SCD). Increased tissue factor expression, phosphatidylserine exposure, thrombin generation and fibrinolysis, as well as decreased levels of natural anticoagulants have been reported in SCD patients and in the mouse models of SCD. Consistent with this, patients with SCD are prone to develop thrombotic complications. In addition, the altered morphology of sickle red blood cells (RBC) may also alter the properties and dynamics of clot formation in SCD patients. Clinical data and results from animal models have revealed complex interactions between coagulation, chronic hemolysis, and inflammation suggesting that activation of coagulation may contribute to the pathophysiology of SCD."
"The primary ?-globin gene mutation that causes sickle cell disease (SCD) has significant pathophysiological consequences that result in hemolytic events and the induction of the inflammatory processes that ultimately lead to vaso-occlusion. In addition to their role in the initiation of the acute painful vaso-occlusive episodes that are characteristic of SCD, inflammatory processes are also key components of many of the complications of the disease including autosplenectomy, acute chest syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers, nephropathy and stroke. We, herein, discuss the events that trigger inflammation in the disease, as well as the mechanisms, inflammatory molecules and cells that propagate these inflammatory processes. Given the central role that inflammation plays in SCD pathophysiology, many of the therapeutic approaches currently under pre-clinical and clinical development for the treatment of SCD endeavor to counter aspects or specific molecules of these inflammatory processes and it is possible that, in the future, we will see anti-inflammatory drugs being used either together with, or in place of, hydroxyurea in those SCD patients for whom hematopoietic stem cell transplants and evolving gene therapies are not a viable option."
"This review focuses on the contribution of abnormal blood rheology in the pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia (SCA). SCA is characterized by a reduction of red blood cell (RBC) deformability but this reduction is very heterogeneous among patients. Recent works have shown that patients with the lowest RBC deformability (measured by ektacytometry) have enhanced hemolysis and would be more prone to develop several complications such as priapism, leg ulcers and glomerulopathy. In contrast, patients with the highest deformability, and not under hydroxyurea therapy, seem to develop more frequently vaso-occlusive like events. Although less studied, RBC aggregation properties are very different between SCA and healthy individuals and it was demonstrated that increased RBC aggregates strength could be involved in some complications. Finally, several studies have established that the vascular system of SCA patients could not fully compensate any increase in blood viscosity because of the loss of vascular reactivity, which may result in vaso-occlusive crises."
"?This article estimates the interaction between types of combined hormonal contraception (CHC) and factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation on the risk of venous thrombosis event (VTE).?All premenopausal women with first incident VTE who were referred to our unit (Paris, France) between 2000 and 2009 were included in this case-only study. Differences in interactions by progestin type were assessed on a multiplicative scale, assuming the independence of genotype and prescription of type of CHC.?Among 2,613 women with VTE, 15.9% had a FVL and 69% used CHC. The interaction between CHC use and presence of FVL on VTE risk was statistically significant (1.37, 1.06-1.77 95% confidence interval [CI]). This interaction appeared higher for drospirenone 1.99 (1.18-3.38 95% CI) (n?=?98) or cyproterone acetate users 1.71 (1.20-2.45 95% CI) (n?=?326), but not significant for 1st or 2nd or norgestimate CHC users. The results were similar when excluding women with a family history of VTE or with provoked VTE. In this sub-group of women, these interactions appeared higher for third generation, cyproterone acetate and drospirenone CHC users as compared with 1st or 2nd or norgestimate CHC users (odds ratio [OR], 1.68 [1.04-2.70; 95% CI], 2.91 [1.71-4.95 95% CI], 3.22 [1.54-6.73 95% CI], respectively).?Our results show that the interaction between FVL and CHC use differ by progestin type, which is higher in CHC containing third-generation progestin, drospirenone or cyproterone acetate, compared with second generation. Further studies are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of biological thrombophilia screening (FVL) when such prescription of CHC is planned."
"?Staphylococcus aureus(S. aureus) bacteraemia is frequent and carries a high morbidity and mortality. Coagulases secreted byS. aureusinitiate blood coagulation by directly activating prothrombin. This pathogen-activated coagulation is insensitive to most antithrombotic drugs, with the exception of small molecule direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs). DTIs inhibit the coagulase-prothrombin complex, or staphylothrombin, and improve outcome in preclinical models ofS. aureusinfection.?A single-centre, randomized, controlled feasibility and safety trial of staphylothrombin inhibition with DTIs in patients withS. aureusbacteraemia.?Consecutive eligible adult patients withS. aureuspositive blood cultures in the University Hospitals Leuven (Belgium) were randomized 1:1 to DTI (oral dabigatran 110?mg twice daily or intravenous argatroban according to activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]) for 7 to 10 days, or subcutaneous enoxaparin 40?mg once daily. Primary outcomes were feasibility and safety of DTI in patients withS. aureusbacteraemia. Secondary outcomes include D-dimer evolution (day 0-4) as marker of coagulation activation; inflammatory and microbiological parameters; and clinical outcomes including metastatic infections.?Thirty-one percent (94/303) of screened patients were enrolled. Dabigatran plasma levels inhibited staphylothrombin. Clinically relevant bleeding (5/47 vs. 5/47) and thrombotic (7/47 vs. 7/47) complications were similar in both groups. Coagulase inhibition with DTIs was associated with a trend towards faster D-dimer decrease at day 4 (-662?±?249 ng/mL vs. -40?±?213 ng/mL for DTI-treated patients vs. control;p?=?0.06) and a numerically lower number of persistently positive blood cultures. No differences in inflammatory parameters or other clinical outcomes were observed.?Targeting staphylothrombin with DTIs is feasible in a subset ofS. aureusbacteraemic patients, with comparable safety to standard thromboprophylaxis. In future studies of staphylothrombin inhibition, feasibility can be further improved by rapid diagnostics and by strategies without concomitant anticoagulant effect."
"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is essential for angiogenesis and embryonic development. DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) is an mTOR binding protein that functions to inhibit the mTOR pathway In vitro experiments suggest that DEPTOR is crucial for vascular endothelial cell (EC) activation and angiogenic responses. However, knowledge of the effects of DEPTOR on angiogenesis in vivo is limited. This study aimed to determine the role of DEPTOR in tissue angiogenesis and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms.Cre/loxP conditional gene knockout strategy was used to delete the Deptor gene in mouse vascular ECs. The expression or distribution of cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1?) were detected by immunohistochemical staining or western blot. Tube formation assay was used to measure angiogenesis in vitro.Deptor knockdown led to increased expression of CD31, VEGF and HIF-1? in heart, liver, kidney and aorta. After treatment with rapamycin, their expression was significantly down regulated. In vitro, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were transfected with DEPTOR-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), which resulted in a significant increase in endothelial tube formation and migration rates. In contrast, DEPTOR overexpression markedly reduced the expression of CD31, VEGF and HIF-1?.Our findings demonstrated that deletion of the Deptor gene in vascular ECs resulted in upregulated expression of CD31 and HIF-1?, and further stimulated the expression of VEGF which promoted angiogenesis, indicating that disruption of normal angiogenic pathways may occur through hyperactivation of the mTORC1/HIF-1?/VEGF signaling pathway."
"The increasing human pressure on the environment requires effective protection activities. One way to stop the degradation of natural resources is the presence of woody vegetation networks, mainly linear in character, called linear woody features, greenways or tree belts. These objects, thanks to the many natural and economic functions they serve, enable the realization of sustainable development policy. To properly design a greenway network, the natural conditions and degree of environmental degradation in a given area must first be evaluated. Based on these data, it is possible to determine appropriate afforestation needs. To evaluate the ability of a given area to meet the requirements of greenway functions, we propose a new computer modeling system - a tree belt modeling (TBM). TBM defines the availability of tree belt functions in the planned network and is one of preparation stages in the design of an optimal greenway structure. In this work, to analyze the studied area potential, application of a cadastral dataset was proposed. Thanks to this approach, the obtained results may be related to specific plot borders, which is optimal for greenway construction. To automatize the process of analysis, the TBM was implemented into an ArcGIS toolbox. The result of using this toolbox is a tree belt functions geodatabase. This database contains information about the available functions in the analyzed lines that are potential sites for afforestation. This solution, both at the methodological and technological levels, may significantly increase the effectiveness of greenway planning and thus contribute to more effective activities for sustainable development."
"Recovery of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from wastewater is an important route for wastewater valorization. Selective acidogenic fermentation enables an efficient production of VFAs from wastewater, whereas electrodialysis (ED) provides an effective approach to concentrate VFAs. However, these two processes have not been coupled in one single system previously. In this study, an acidogenesis-ED integrated system that coupled a continuous acidogenesis with a batch process of VFA concentration was developed for recovery of high-concentration VFAs from wastewater. Under 20.0?V voltage, the acetate was concentrated by 4-fold and the propionate and butyrate were concentrated by over 3-fold in the integrated system after 528-h operation. The declined VFAs recovery ratios at the later stage due to significant reverse diffusion indicate a need to prevent product over-accumulation. This work demonstrated the feasibility of the acidogenesis-ED integrated reactor for wastewater valorization and discussed the remaining challenges and opportunities."
"Although abundantly present in soils, inorganic phosphate (Pi) acquisition by plants is highly dependent on the transmembrane phosphate transporter (PT) gene family. Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) requires a large amount of phosphorus (P). The purpose of this study was to isolate the CsPT2-1 from cucumber roots, and to determine the influence of Pi nutrition on cucumber growth, metabolism and transcript levels of CsPT2-1 in tissues. Full length CsPT2-1 was cloned and phylogenetically identified. In two greenhouse experiments, P-deficient seedlings provided with low or high P concentrations were sampled at 10 and 21 days post treatment, respectively. Addition of P dramatically reduced growth of roots but not shoots. Supplying plants with high P resulted in increased total protein in leaves. Acid phosphatase activity increased significantly in leaves at any rate higher than 4?mM?P. Increasing P concentration had a notable decrease in glucose concentrations in leaves of plants supplied with >0.5?mM?P. In roots, glucose and starch concentrations increased with increasing P supply. Steady-state transcript levels of CsPT2-1 were high in P-deprived roots, but declined when plants were provided >10?mM?P. To our knowledge, this is the first report focusing on a PT and its expression levels in cucumber."
"Optimization of traditional replication-competent viral tracers has granted access to immediate synaptic partners of target neuronal populations, enabling the dissection of complex brain circuits into functional neural pathways. The excessive virulence of most conventional tracers, however, impedes their utility in revealing and genetically perturbing cellular function on long time scales. As a promising alternative, the natural capacity of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to safely mediate persistent and robust gene expression has stimulated strong interest in adapting them for sparse neuronal labeling and physiological studies. Furthermore, increasingly refined engineering strategies have yielded novel AAV variants with enhanced target specificity, transduction, and retrograde trafficking in the CNS. These potent vectors offer new opportunities for characterizing the identity and connectivity of single neurons within immense networks and modulating their activity via robust delivery of functional genetic tools."
"Potential transformations of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) upon interaction with naturally ubiquitous organic ligands in aquatic environments influence their transport, persistence, bioavailability, and subsequent toxicity to organisms. In this study, differential behaviors of AgNPs and silver ions (Ag+) towards cysteine (Cys), an amino acid representative of thiol ligands that easily coordinate to Ag+and graft to nanoparticle surfaces, were investigated in the aspects of bioremediation and their toxicity to Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Total Ag removal, 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) degradation, extracellular protein secretion, and cellular viability were enhanced to some extent after supplement of various concentrations of cysteine under stress of AgNPs and Ag+. However, an obvious decrease in total Ag uptake was observed after 5-50??M cysteine addition in the groups treated with 10??M AgNPs and 1??M Ag+, especially at a Cys:Ag molar ratio of 5. More stabilization in uptake pattern at this ratio was detected under Ag+exposure than that under AgNP exposure. Furthermore, in the absence of cysteine, all Ag+treatments stimulated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) more significantly than high-dose AgNPs did. However, cysteine supply under AgNP/Ag+stress aggravated ROS levels, albeit alleviated at 100??M Ag+, indicating that the toxicity profiles of AgNPs and Ag+to P. chrysosporium could be exacerbated or marginally mitigated by cysteine. The results obtained were possibly associated with the lability and bioavailability of AgNP/Ag+-cysteine complexes."
"It is generally assumed that zooplankton can recolonize lakes that have been exposed to pesticides, via their dormant egg banks. Hitherto, few studies have evaluated the relative importance of dormant egg bank recruitment in the re-establishment of zooplankton communities in the presence of pesticide. This study investigated the effects of commercial products Bratt®(a.i. 2,4-D), Roundup®(a.i. glyphosate) and their mixture on the emergence (abundance and taxon richness) of dormant zooplankton egg banks from natural lake sediment. Sediment samples were collected from the surface sediment (<10?cm depth) in four lakes in Southeast São Paulo, Brazil. We performed a hatching experiment, in which natural lake sediments containing dormant eggs were exposed separately to Bratt®(applied concentrations ranging from 0.30 to 20?mg?L-1), Roundup®(0.28-8.5?mg?L-1), and combined mixtures of all concentrations, plus one control (non-exposure to formulated herbicides) for a period of 28 days. All tested concentrations of Bratt®, Roundup®and their mixture reduced the abundance and taxon richness of emerging zooplankton (except 2?mg?L-1of Bratt®). This effect was more pronounced in rotifers. In comparison, there were no negative effects on the emergence of microcrustaceans. These findings suggest that commercial products Bratt®, Roundup®and their mixture can suppress the emergence of rotifers, thereby influencing zooplankton recruitment potential in lakes impacted by the presence of these commercial herbicides. Our results stress the importance of the need for additional studies to assess the effects of pesticides on dormant egg banks."
"The molecular docking has been employed successfully to study the mechanism of biodegradation in the environmental remediation in the past few years, although medical science and biology are the main application areas for it. Molecular docking is a very convenient and low cost method to understand the reaction mechanism of proteins or enzymes with ligands with a high accuracy. This paper mainly provides a review for the application of molecular docking between organic pollutants and enzymes. It summarizes the fundamental knowledge of molecular docking, such as its theory, available softwares and main databases. Moreover, five types of pollutants, including phenols, BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes), nitrile, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and high polymer (e.g., lignin and cellulose), are discussed from molecular level. Different removal mechanisms are also explained in detail via docking technology. Even though this method shows promising application in the research of biodegradation, further studies are still needed to relate with actual condition."
"Proteomic studies were carried out in immature (3 week), adult (18 week) and aged (48 week) rats to understand the age dependent vulnerability to lindane induced neurodegeneration. 2-D and western blot analysis of protein extracts of hippocampus and substantia-nigra isolated from lindane treated rats (2.5?mg/kg; p.o. X 21 days) revealed marked dysregulation in the expression of proteins related to ubiquitin proteasome pathway, antioxidant activity, chaperones, energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis and proteins involved in neurodegeneration. These alterations were associated with marked increase in reactive oxygen species formation, lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione content and antioxidant enzyme activities in lindane treated rats. Aged rats, in particular showed higher magnitude of alteration in these proteins when compared to immature or adult rats. Proteins involved in apoptosis and autophagy also showed marked alterations in their expression, particularly in the aged rats. Ultrastructural analysis revealed greater number of autophagic vesicle in hippocampus and substantia-nigra in treated aged rats. The data suggest that proteomic approaches could be used to investigate the vulnerability to lindane induced neurodegeneration in rats."
"Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck is extensively cultivated worldwide and one of the most consumed fruits in the world. We evaluated the therapeutic properties of the methanol extract from Citrus sinensis fruit peel (CSMe) in high-fat diet-fed streptozotocin-induced insulin-resistant diabetic rats. Body weight, food intake, and water consumption were analysed. Biochemical and molecular biologic indices, and the expression of insulin receptor-induced signalling molecules were assessed to identify possible mechanisms. In addition, we conducted histology of pancreatic and adipose tissues. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis showed the presence of 17 dietary phenolics at substantial concentrations. High-fat diet-fed streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats administered CSMe (50 and 100?mg/kg) had reduced fasting blood glucose (56.1% and 55.7%, respectively) and plasma insulin levels (22.9% and 32.7%, respectively) compared with untreated diabetic control rats. CSMe reversed the biochemical abnormalities in diabetic rats, showed cytoprotective activity, and increased the intensity of the positive immunoreactions for insulin in pancreatic islets. CSMe treatment increased the expression of PPAR? in the adipose tissue and signalling molecules GLUT4 and insulin receptor. Our data suggest that CSMe could optimize glucose uptake of adipose tissues through the insulin-dependent signalling cascade mechanism and it should be investigated in the management of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
"Recent studies suggest that human derived intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) cultured as polarized monolayers on Transwell®filters may respond differently when exposed to hazardous and non-hazardous proteins. This experimental platform was based on apical exposure of IEC monolayers to test proteins for 24?h followed by assessment of barrier integrity and cell viability. In this study, Caco-2 and T84 IEC polarized monolayers were evaluated for barrier integrity and cytotoxicity following exposure to hazardous and non-hazardous proteins for 24, 48 and 72?h. Hazardous proteins included Clostridium difficile toxin A (ToxA), Streptolysin O (SLO), Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA), and Phaseolus vulgaris haemagglutinin-E (PHA-E). Non-hazardous proteins included bovine serum albumin (BSA), porcine serum albumin (PSA), and fibronectin (Fbn). In general, evidence of diminished barrier integrity or cell viability observed following exposure to hazardous proteins for 24?h was more pronounced after 48 and 72?h for both IEC monolayers. Non-hazardous proteins exhibiting no impact following 24?h of exposure elicited minimal effects over longer exposure durations. These results support the utility of using cultured human IEC polarized monolayers to differentiate between hazardous and non-hazardous proteins and suggest that longer durations of exposure may further improve the ability to distinguish between them."
"Many cognitive processes, such episodic memory and decision making, rely on the ability to form associations between two events that occur separately in time. The formation of such temporal associations depends on neural representations of three types of information: what has been presented (trace holding), what will follow (temporal expectation), and when the following event will occur (explicit timing). The present review seeks to link these representations with firing patterns of single neurons recorded while rodents and non-human primates associate stimuli, outcomes, and motor responses over time intervals. Across these studies, two distinct firing patterns were observed in the hippocampus, neocortex, and striatum: some neurons change firing rates during or shortly after the stimulus presentation and sustain the firing rate stably or sidlingly during the subsequent intervals (tonic firings). Other neurons transiently change firing rates during a specific moment within the time intervals (phasic firings), and as a group, they form a sequential firing pattern that covers the entire interval. Clever task designs used in some of these studies collectively provide evidence that both tonic and phasic firing responses represent trace holding, temporal expectation, and explicit timing. Subsequently, we applied machine-learning based classification approaches to the two firing patterns within the same dataset collected from rat medial prefrontal cortex during trace eyeblink conditioning. This quantitative analysis revealed that phasic-firing patterns showed greater selectivity for stimulus identity and temporal position than tonic-firing patterns. Our summary illuminates distributed neural representations of temporal association in the forebrain and generates several ideas for future investigations."
"Extinction-based exposure therapy is the most common behavioral therapy for anxiety and trauma-related disorders, but fear tends to resurface even after successful extinction. Identification of novel strategies to enhance fear extinction and reduce fear relapse is of paramount importance to mental health. Exercise can enhance cognitive function, but it is not yet well understood whether exercise can be an effective augmentation strategy for fear extinction. In the current review, we present the current state of knowledge on the effects of exercise on fear extinction. Effects of exercise duration, explanations for conflicting results, and potential mechanisms, focusing on a hypothesized role for dopamine, are all discussed. We also provide new data suggesting that the timing in which acute exercise occurs relative to fear extinction, is a crucial variable in determining whether exercise can enhance fear extinction. Clinical implications and ideas to guide future research endeavors in this area are provided."
"Ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is important in the regulation of bacterial iron metabolism and uptake of Fe from the environment. We evaluated the contribution of fur to the sensitivity and oxidative response of A. baumannii to antibiotics. Deletion of fur increased the sensitivity of A. baumannii AB5075 to colistin, gentamicin, rifampicin and tigecycline. Furthermore, activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in ?fur mutant decreased significantly compared to the parental strain. Conversely, O2- and H2O2accumulate in colistin, gentamicin, rifampicin or tigecycline-treated ?fur mutant compared to the parental strain. Ferrous ion (Fe2+) content of ?fur mutant increased compared to the parental strain. Fe chelator 2,2'-bipyridyl lowered the sensitivity of A. baumannii to the antibiotics. The antibiotics, except tigecycline, raised the NAD+/NADH and ADP/ATP ratio of ?fur mutant compared to the WT. Glutathione content of ?fur mutant was significantly depleted compared to parental strain following exposure to the antibiotics. We conclude that decreased capability of ?fur mutant to detoxify reactive oxygen species raised its susceptibility to antibiotics through Fenton chemistry."
"Tissue kallikrein, kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs), and plasma kallikrein form the largest group of serine proteases in the human genome, sharing many structural and functional properties. Several KLK transcripts have been found aberrantly expressed in numerous human malignancies, confirming their prognostic or/and diagnostic values. However, the process of alternative splicing can now be studied in-depth due to the development of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). In the present study, we used NGS to discover novel transcripts of the KLK1 and KLK2 genes, after nested touchdown PCR. Bioinformatics analysis and PCR experiments revealed a total of eleven novel KLK transcripts (two KLK1 and nine KLK2 transcripts). In addition, the expression profiles of each novel transcript were investigated with nested PCR experiments using variant-specific primers. Since KLKs are implicated in human malignancies, qualifying as potential biomarkers, the quantification of the presented novel transcripts in human samples may have clinical applications in different types of cancer."
"High-throughput time-series data have a special value for studying the dynamism of biological systems. However, the interpretation of such complex data can be challenging. The aim of this study was to compare common algorithms recently developed for the detection of differentially expressed genes in time-course microarray data. Using different measures such as sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and related signaling pathways, we found that limma, timecourse, and gprege have reasonably good performance for the analysis of datasets in which only test group is followed over time. However, limma has the additional advantage of being able to report significance cut off, making it a more practical tool. In addition, limma and TTCA can be satisfactorily used for datasets with time-series data for all experimental groups. These findings may assist investigators to select appropriate tools for the detection of differentially expressed genes as an initial step in the interpretation of time-course big data."
"The ActualHCA system continuously monitors the activity, temperature and behaviour of group-housed rats without invasive surgery. The system was validated to detect the contrasting effects of sedative and stimulant test agents (chlorpromazine, clonidine and amphetamine), and compared with the modified Irwin test (mIT) with rectal temperature measurements.Six male Han Wistar rats per group were used to assess each test agent and vehicle controls in separate ActualHCA recordings and mIT. The mIT was undertaken at 15, 30?mins, 1, 2, 4 and 24?h post-dose. ActualHCA recorded continuously for 24?h post-dose under 3 experimental conditions: dosed during light phase, dark phase, and light phase with a scheduled cage change at the time of peak effects determined by mIT.ActualHCA detected an increase stimulated activity from the cage change at 1-2?h post-dose which was obliterated by chlorpromazine and clonidine. Amphetamine increased activity up to 4?h post-dose in all conditions. Temperature from ActualHCA was affected by all test agents in all conditions. The mIT showed effects on all 3 test agents up to 4?h post-dose, with maximal effects at 1-2?h post-dose. The maximal effects on temperature from ActualHCA differed from mIT. Delayed effects on activity were detected by ActualHCA, but not on mIT.Continuous monitoring has the advantage of capturing effects over time that may be missed with manual tests using pre-determined time points. Thisautomated behavioural system does not replace the need for conventional methods but could be implemented simultaneously to improve our understanding of behavioural pharmacology."
"Plants and animals in endosomes operate TPC1/SV-type cation channels. Although all plant cells functionally express at least one TPC1 gene, and the encoded SV channel was already discovered in the plant vacuole membrane two decades ago, its biological function has remained enigmatic. Recently, the structure of a plant TPC1/SV channel protein was determined. Insights into the 3D topology has now guided site-directed mutation approaches, enabling SV channel structure-function analyses and shed new light on earlier findings. Fou2 plants operating a hyperactive mutant form of TPC1 develop wounding stress phenotypes. Recent studies with fou2 and mutants that lack functional TPC1 have revealed atypical features in local and long-distance stress signaling, providing new access to the previously mysterious biology of this vacuolar cation channel type in planta."
"Anoplin (GLLKRIKTLL-NH2) is of current interest due to its short sequence and specificity towards bacteria. Recent studies on anoplin have shown that truncation and acylation compromises its antimicrobial activity and specificity, respectively. In this study, truncated analogues (pal-ano-9 to pal-ano-5) of palmitoylated anoplin (pal-anoplin) were synthesized to determine the effects of C-truncation on its bioactivities. Moreover, secondary structure of each analogue using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was determined to correlate with bioactivities. Interestingly, pal-anoplin, pal-ano-9 and pal-ano-6 were helical in water, unlike anoplin. In contrast, pal-ano-8, pal-ano-7 and pal-ano-5, with polar amino acid residues at the C-terminus, were random coil in water. Nevertheless, all the peptides folded into helical structures in 30% trifluoroethanol/water (TFE/H2O) except for the shortest analogue pal-ano-5. Hydrophobicity played a significant role in the enhancement of activity against bacteria E. coli and S. aureus as all lipopeptides including the random coil pal-ano-5 were more active than the parent anoplin. Meanwhile, the greatest improvement in activity against the fungus C. albicans was observed for pal-anoplin analogues (pal-ano-9 and pal-ano-6) that were helical in water. Although, hydrophobicity is a major factor in the secondary structure and antimicrobial activity, it appears that the nature of amino acids at the C-terminus also influence folding of lipopeptides in water and its antifungal activity. Moreover, the hemolytic activity of the analogues was found to correlate with hydrophobicity, except the least hemolytic pal-ano-5. Since most of the analogues are more potent and shorter than anoplin, they are promising drug candidates for further development."
"To determine if the intranasal delivery of neuroactive compounds is a viable, long-term treatment strategy for progressive, chronic neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), intranasal methodologies in preclinical models comparable to humans are needed.We developed a methodology to evaluate the repeated intranasal delivery of neuroactive compounds on the non-human primate (NHP) brain, without the need for sedation. We evaluated the effects of the neuroactive peptide, DNSP-11 following repeated intranasal delivery and dose-escalation over the course of 10-weeks in Rhesus macaques. This approach allowed us to examine striatal target engagement, safety and tolerability, and brain distribution following a single125I-labeled DNSP-11 dose.Our initial data support that repeated intranasal delivery and dose-escalation of DNSP-11 resulted in bilateral, striatal target engagement based on neurochemical changes in DA metabolites-without observable, adverse behavioral effects or weight loss in NHPs. Furthermore, a125I-labeled DNSP-11 study illustrates diffuse rostral to caudal distribution in the brain including the striatum-our target region of interest.The results of this study are compared to our experiments in normal and 6-OHDA lesioned rats, where DNSP-11 was repeatedly delivered intranasally using a micropipette with animals under light sedation.The results from this proof-of-concept study support the utility of our repeated intranasal dosing methodology in awake Rhesus macaques, to evaluate the effects of neuroactive compounds on the NHP brain. Additionally, results indicate that DNSP-11 can be safely and effectively delivered intranasally in MPTP-treated NHPs, while engaging the DA system."
Symbiotic bacteria of the genus Thiosymbion attach to the surface of their nematode hosts using their poles and divide by longitudinal binary fission. A new study now sheds light on the molecular mechanisms that underlie this peculiar mode of proliferation.
"A few years ago, Francis Crick's son told me a story that I can't get out of my mind. I had contacted Michael Crick by email while digging through the background of the researchers who had cracked the genetic code in the 1960s. Francis had died in 2004, and I was contacting some of the people who knew him when he was struggling to decipher the code. Francis didn't appear to struggle often - he is known mostly for his successes - and, as it turns out, this one well-known struggle may have had a clue sitting just barely out of sight."

"The small GTPase Ras proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes. We investigated the functions of RapC, one of 15 Ras subfamily GTPases in Dictyostelium. Loss of RapC resulted in a spread shape of cells; severe defects in cytokinesis leading to multinucleation; decrease of migration speed in chemoattractant-mediated cell migration, likely through increased cell adhesion; and aberrations in multicellular development producing abnormal multiple tips from one mound and multi-branched developmental structures. Defects in cells lacking RapC were rescued by expressing GFP-RapC in rapC null cells. Our results demonstrate that RapC, despite its high sequence homology with Rap1, plays a negative role in cell spreading and cell adhesion, in contrast to Rap1, which is a key regulator of cell adhesion and cytoskeleton rearrangement. In addition, RapC appears to have a unique function in multicellular development and is involved in tip formation from mounds. This study contributes to the understanding of Ras-mediated cellular processes."
"Genome editing in human cells with targeted nucleases now enables diverse experimental and therapeutic genome engineering applications, but extension to primary human B cells remains limited. Here we report a method for targeted genetic engineering in primary human B cells, utilizing electroporation of CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to introduce gene knockout mutations at protein-coding loci with high efficiencies that in some cases exceeded 80%. Further, we demonstrate knock-in editing of targeted nucleotides with efficiency exceeding 10% through co-delivery of oligonucleotide templates for homology directed repair. We delivered Cas9 RNPs in two distinct in vitro culture systems to achieve editing in both undifferentiated B cells and activated B cells undergoing differentiation, reflecting utility in diverse experimental conditions. In summary, we demonstrate a powerful and scalable research tool for functional genetic studies of human B cell biology that may have further applications in engineered B cell therapeutics."
"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a member of the mammalian peroxidase family. It is mainly expressed in neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages. As a catalyzer of reactive oxidative species and radical species formation, it contributes to neutrophil bactericidal activity. Nevertheless MPO invalidation does not seem to have major health consequences in affected individuals. This suggests that MPO might have alternative functions supporting its conservation during evolution. We will review the available data supporting these non-canonical functions in terms of tissue specific expression, function and enzymatic activity. Thus, we discuss its cell type specific expression. We review in between others its roles in angiogenesis, endothelial (dys-) function, immune reaction, and inflammation. We summarize its pathological actions in clinical conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer."
"Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing short interfering RNA (LNP-siRNA) and optimized ionizable cationic lipids are now clinically validated systems for silencing disease-causing genes in hepatocytes following intravenous administration. However, the mechanism of formation and certain structural features of LNP-siRNA remain obscure. These systems are formed from lipid mixtures (cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid) dissolved in ethanol that is rapidly mixed with siRNA in aqueous buffer at a pH (pH 4) where the ionizable lipid is positively charged. The resulting dispersion is then dialyzed against a normal saline buffer to remove residual ethanol and raise the pH to 7.4 (above the p Kaof the cationic lipid) to produce the finished LNP-siRNA systems. Here we provide cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and X-ray evidence that the complexes formed between siRNA and ionizable lipid at pH 4 correspond to tightly packed bilayer structures with siRNA sandwiched between closely apposed monolayers. Further, it is shown that ionizable lipid not complexed to siRNA promotes formation of very small vesicular structures at pH 4 that coalesce to form larger LNP structures with amorphous electron dense cores at pH 7.4. A mechanism of formation of LNP-siRNA systems is proposed whereby siRNA is first sandwiched between closely apposed lipid monolayers at pH 4 and subsequently trapped in these structures as the pH is raised to 7.4, whereas ionizable lipid not interacting with siRNA moves from bilayer structure to adopt an amorphous oil phase located in the center of the LNP as the pH is raised. This model is discussed in terms of previous hypotheses and potential relevance to the design of LNP-siRNA systems."
"Nano-size lipid vesicles are used extensively at the interface between nanotechnology and biology, e.g. as containers for chemical reactions at minute concentrations and vehicles for targeted delivery of pharmaceuticals. Typically, vesicle samples are heterogeneous as regards vesicle size and structural properties. Consequently, vesicles must be characterized individually to ensure correct interpretation of experimental results. Here we do that using dual-color fluorescence labeling of vesicles-of their lipid bilayers and lumens, respectively. A vesicle then images as two spots, one in each color channel. A simple image analysis determines the total intensity and width of each spot. These four data all depend on the vesicle radius in a simple manner for vesicles that are spherical, unilamellar, and optimal encapsulators of molecular cargo. This permits identification of such ideal vesicles. They in turn enable calibration of the dual-color fluorescence microscopy images they appear in. Since this calibration is not a separate experiment but an analysis of images of vesicles to be characterized, it eliminates the potential source of error that a separate calibration experiment would have been. Non-ideal vesicles in the same images were characterized by how their four data violate the calibrated relationship established for ideal vesicles. In this way, our method yields size, shape, lamellarity, and encapsulation efficiency of each imaged vesicle. Applying this procedure to extruded samples of vesicles, we found that, contrary to common assumptions, only a fraction of vesicles are ideal."
"Marine planktonic microalgae have potentially global dispersal, yet reduced gene flow has been confirmed repeatedly for several species. Over larger distances (>200 km) geographic isolation and restricted oceanographic connectivity have been recognized as instrumental in driving population divergence. Here we investigated whether similar patterns, i.e. structured populations governed by geographic isolation and/or oceanographic connectivity, can be observed at smaller (6-152 km) geographic scales. To test this we established 425 clonal cultures of the planktonic diatom Skeletonema marinoi collected from 11 locations in the Archipelago Sea (northern Baltic Sea). The region is characterized by a complex topography, entailing several mixing regions of which four were included in the sampling area. Using eight microsatellite markers and conventional F-statistics, significant genetic differentiation was observed between several sites. Moreover, Bayesian cluster analysis revealed the co-occurrence of two genetic groups spread throughout the area. However, geographic isolation and oceanographic connectivity could not explain the genetic patterns observed. Our data reveal hierarchical genetic structuring whereby despite high dispersal potential, significantly diverged populations have developed over small spatial scales. Our results suggest that biological characteristics and historical events may be more important in generating barriers to gene flow than physical barriers at small spatial scales.

"Many microbial taxa associated with healthy animals have both within-host and free-living populations, but little is known about the magnitude, persistence and dispersal of their populations in the external environment. Advances, particularly in our understanding of the population dynamics of free-living populations and microbial cycling between the external environment and hosts, can be achieved by the creative use of current technologies. In particular, there are opportunities to adapt methods, such as capture-mark-release techniques widely used in animal ecology, to the study of symbiotic microorganisms. Future technological advances are, however, required to monitor the location, proliferation and metabolic status at the scale of the single cell, especially under natural conditions. These advances will enable us to achieve precise quantification of host impacts on both micro-habitat suitability for microbial proliferation and microbial dispersal in the external environment. The resultant understanding of the fate of microorganisms shed from animal hosts is essential for the development of environmentally-safe and reliable microbial therapies for humans and animals of economic and environmental importance. Achieving an understanding of the ecology of symbiotic microorganisms is a key challenge for the discipline of environmental microbiology in the coming years. This article is protected by copyright.

"Ectomycorrhizal fungi play an essential role in the ecology of boreal and temperate forests through the improvement of tree mineral nutrition. Potassium (K+) is an essential nutrient for plants and is needed in high amounts. We recently demonstrated that the ectomycorrhizal fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum improves the K+nutrition of Pinus pinaster under shortage conditions. Part of the transport systems involved in K+uptake by the fungus has been deciphered, while the molecular players responsible for the transfer of this cation towards the plant remain totally unknown. Analysis of the genome of H. cylindrosporum revealed the presence of three putative tandem-pore outward-rectifying K+(TOK) channels that could contribute to this transfer. Here we report the functional characterization of these three channels through two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments in oocytes and yeast complementation assays. The expression pattern and physiological role of these channels were analyzed in symbiotic interaction with P. pinaster. Pine seedlings colonized by fungal transformants overexpressing two of them displayed a larger accumulation of K+in shoots. This study revealed that TOK channels have distinctive properties and functions in axenic and symbiotic conditions, and suggested that HcTOK2.2 is implicated in the symbiotic transfer of K+from the fungus towards the plant.

"Due to limited knowledge on the differences in the correlates of psychological well-being (PSWB) between girls and boys, we compared the correlates of PSWB between primary school girls and boys.A population sample of 412 children participated in the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children study. Parents completed a questionnaire that included 19 questions on the components of PSWB, and a PSWB score was computed. We assessed correlates of PSWB, including physical activity, sedentary behaviour, cardiorespiratory fitness, diet quality, body fat content, sleep duration, sleep disordered breathing, prevalent diseases and parental characteristics. We used logistic regression to analyse the risk of being in the lowest third of the PSWB scores.Low parental education was associated with increased risk (odds ratio (OR) 2.34, P?=?0.039) and high cardiorespiratory fitness with decreased risk (OR 0.26, P?=?0.006) of poor PSWB in girls. At least 2 h of screen-based sedentary behaviour per day (OR 1.93, P?=?0.037), daily parental smoking (OR 2.10, P?=?0.034) and sleep disordered breathing (OR 4.24, P?=?0.003) were related to increased risk of poor PSWB in boys.There are large differences in the correlates of PSWB between girls and boys. Most of these correlates are modifiable and related to the health behaviour of children and their parents."
"The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is becoming the method of choice for expression of many eukaryotic proteins and protein complexes for biochemical, structural and pharmaceutical studies. Significant technological advancement has made generation of recombinant baculoviruses easy, efficient and user-friendly. However, there is a tremendous variability in the amount of proteins made using the BEVS, including different batches of virus made to express the same proteins. Yet, what influences the overall production of proteins or protein complexes remains largely unclear. Many downstream applications, particularly protein structure determination, require purification of large quantities of proteins in a repetitive manner, calling for a reliable experimental set-up to obtain proteins or protein complexes of interest consistently. During our investigation of optimizing the expression of the Mediator Head module, we discovered that the 'initial infectivity' was an excellent indicator of overall production of protein complexes. Further, we show that this initial infectivity can be mathematically described as a function of multiplicity of infection (MOI), correlating recombinant protein yield and virus titer. All these findings led us to develop the Titer Estimation for Quality Control (TEQC) method, which enables researchers to estimate initial infectivity, titer/MOI values in a simple and affordable way, and to use these values to quantitatively optimize protein expressions utilizing BEVS in a highly reproducible fashion."
"Fire is a major driver in many ecosystems. Yet, little is known about how different ground-living arthropods survive fire. Using three sampling methods, and time-since-fire (last fire event: 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years), we investigate how ground-living arthropod diversity responds to fire, and how species richness, diversity, abundance, and composition of the four dominant taxa: ants, beetles, cockroaches and mites, respond. We did this in the naturally fire-prone Mediterranean-type scrubland vegetation (fynbos) of the Cape Floristic Region. Surprisingly, overall species richness and diversity was the same for all time-since-fire categories. However, when each dominant taxon was analysed separately, effect of fire on species richness and abundance varied among taxa. This emphasizes that many taxa must be investigated to really understand fire-driven events. We also highlight the importance of using different diversity measures, as fire did not influence species richness and abundance of particular taxa, while it affected others, overall greatly affecting assemblages of all taxa. Rockiness affected species richness, abundance and composition of a few taxa. We found that all time-since-fire categories supported distinctive assemblages. Some indicator species occurred across all time-since-fire categories, while others were restricted to a single time-since-fire category, showing that there is a wide range of responses to fire between taxa. Details of local landscape structure, abiotic and biotic, and frequency and intensity of fire add complexity to the fire-arthropod interaction. Overall, we show that the relationship between fire and arthropods is phylogenetically constrained, having been honed by many millennia of fire events, and highly complex. Present-day species manifest a variety of adaptations for surviving the great natural selective force of fire."
"Hydrogen isotope analysis of feather keratin (?2HF) has become an essential tool for tracking movements between breeding and wintering populations of migratory birds. In particular, ?2HF has been used to create ?2HF isoscapes that can be used to assign the geographic origins of molt. The majority of past studies have sampled a portion of a single feather as an isotopic proxy for the entire plumage although surprisingly little is known about variation of stable isotopes within and between feather tracts of individuals in local populations. Here we examine ?2HF variation in 24 pterylographic variables (9 primaries, 6 secondaries, 6 rectrices, and 3 patches of ventral contour feathers) in individual specimens of black-throated blue warbler (Setophaga caerulescens) breeding in the Big Santeetlah Creek watershed (5350 ha), southern Appalachian Mountains. By restricting our study to territorial ASY males (after second year) inhabiting a small watershed, we could focus on ?2HF variation generated during the complete prebasic annual molt in a circumscribed population while factoring out age and sexual differences in foraging behavior, isotopic incorporation, and post-breeding dispersal. Summed within-individual variation (?2HF) across 24 pterylographic variables ranged from 12 to 60 (= 21.8 ± 9.4), with 81% of the individuals exhibiting variation ? 16 (reproducibility of analyses was ? 4 ). Adjacent feathers in feather tracts tend to have more similar ?2HF values than feathers grown weeks apart, consistent with the stepwise replacement of flight feathers. The pooled population sample exhibited significant ?2HF variation in primaries (-78 to -21), secondaries (-80 to -17), rectrices (-78 to -23), and ventral contour feathers (-92 to -32). Strong year effects in ?2HF variation were observed in each of the 24 pterylographic variables. Altitudinal effects were observed only in ventral contour feathers. The current findings demonstrate that within-individual variation (?2HF) may be much greater than previously thought in migratory species that molt on or near breeding territories. Our study also highlights the need for greater pterylographic precision in research design of isotope-based studies of avian movement. Within-individual and within-population ?2HF variation should be incorporated in geographic assignment models. In a broader context, the staggered Staffelmauser pattern of molt in wood warblers provides an exceptional view of the seasonal variation of hydrogen isotopes circulating in blood plasma during the six-week period of annual molt."
"The malaria-causing blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum requires extracellular pantothenate for proliferation. The parasite converts pantothenate into coenzyme A (CoA) via five enzymes, the first being a pantothenate kinase (PfPanK). Multiple antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, including pantothenol and CJ-15,801, kill the parasite by targeting CoA biosynthesis/utilisation. Their mechanism of action, however, remains unknown. Here, we show that parasites pressured with pantothenol or CJ-15,801 become resistant to these analogues. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in one of two putative PanK genes (Pfpank1) in each resistant line. These mutations significantly alter PfPanK activity, with two conferring a fitness cost, consistent with Pfpank1 coding for a functional PanK that is essential for normal growth. The mutants exhibit a different sensitivity profile to recently-described, potent, antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, with one line being hypersensitive. We provide evidence consistent with different pantothenate analogue classes having different mechanisms of action: some inhibit CoA biosynthesis while others inhibit CoA-utilising enzymes."
"Increasing evidence indicates that the Golgi apparatus plays active roles in cancer, but a comprehensive understanding of its functions in the oncogenic transformation has not yet emerged. At the same time, the Golgi is becoming well recognized as a hub that integrates its functions of protein and lipid biosynthesis to signal transduction for cell proliferation and migration in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the active function of the Golgi apparatus in cancer cells has not been fully evaluated as a target for combined treatment. Here, we analyzed the effect of perturbing the Golgi apparatus on the sensitivity of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line to the drugs Actinomycin D and Vinblastine. We disrupted the function of ARF1, a protein necessary for the homeostasis of the Golgi apparatus. We found that the expression of the ARF1-Q71L mutant increased the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to both Actinomycin D and Vinblastine, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and cell migration, as well as in increased apoptosis. Likewise, the combined treatment of cells with Actinomycin D or Vinblastine and Brefeldin A or Golgicide A, two disrupting agents of the ARF1 function, resulted in similar effects on cell proliferation, cell migration and apoptosis. Interestingly, each combined treatment had distinct effects on ERK1/2 and AKT signaling, as indicated by the decreased levels of either phospho-ERK1/2 or phospho-AKT. Our results suggest that disruption of Golgi function could be used as a strategy for the sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy."
"Kisspeptins acting on their cognate G protein-coupled receptor, kisspeptin receptor, play important roles in the suppression of cancer cell metastasis and regulation of the reproductive system, and therefore are important for therapeutic intervention. All native functional human kisspeptins (kisspeptin-54, kisspsptin-14 and kisspeptin-13) share the 10 amino acids of kisspeptin-10 at their C-terminus (45-54). However, they are inactivated rapidly by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) through the cleavage of the peptide bond between glycine51 and leucine52, which limits their clinical applications. Development of MMP-resistant analogues of kisspeptins may provide better therapeutic outputs. In the present study, two kisspeptin phosphinic peptides were designed and synthesized, and their ability to induce phosphorylation of ERK1/2 through kisspeptin receptor and their inhibition on MMP-2 and MMP-9 whose activity correlates with cancer metastasis were assessed. The results showed that one analogue, phosphinic kisspeptin R isomer (PKPR), exhibited kisspeptin receptor-agonistic activity and also inhibitory activity on MMP-2, indicating that PKPR may serve as a lead for the further development of kisspeptin analogues for therapeutic purpose."
"We retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of combined use of salivary gland ultrasonography (US) and the 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatic Disease (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for improving the diagnostic efficiency in patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SS). A US-based salivary gland disease grading system was developed using a cohort comprising 213 SS or non-SS patients who fulfilled the minimum requirements for classifying SS based on the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and ACR criteria. Using 62 SS or non-SS patients from the 213 patients and who had also undergone all the 5 examinations needed for the ACR/EULAR classification, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of various combinations of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications for diagnosing SS, using the clinical diagnosis of SS by rheumatologists as the gold standard. The ACR/EULAR criteria discriminated clinical SS patients with 77% and 79% accuracy for those with primary or secondary SS and for those with primary SS, respectively. However, the integrated score system of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications yielded 92% and 93% accuracy for these 2 SS patient groups, respectively, provided that US score of 3 was assigned to patients with US grade ?2, and then patients with integrated threshold score of ?5 were diagnosed as SS. Cross-validation also indicated improved accuracy of the integrated ACR/EULAR and US score system (91.9 and 93.0% for primary/secondary and primary SS patients, respectively) over that by the ACR/EULAR criteria alone. (74.2 and 86.0%, respectively). The integrated ACR/EULAR and US scoring system can improve the diagnosis of patients with clinical SS."
"Women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Evidence suggests the microclimate of the classroom is an important factor influencing female course grades and interest, which encourages retention of women in STEM fields. Here, we test whether the gender composition of small (8-9 person) learning groups impacts course performance, sense of social belonging, and intragroup peer evaluations of intellectual contributions. Across two undergraduate active learning courses in introductory biology, we manipulated the classroom microclimate by varying the gender ratios of learning groups, ranging from 0% female to 100% female. We found that as the percent of women in groups increased, so did overall course performance for all students, regardless of gender. Additionally, women assigned higher peer- evaluations in groups with more women than groups with less women. Our work demonstrates an added benefit of the retention of women in STEM: increased performance for all, and positive peer perceptions for women."
"Waterbirds disperse a wide range of plant seeds via their guts, promoting biotic connectivity between isolated habitat patches. However, the intensity of digestive forces encountered by seeds, and therefore their potential to survive digestive tract passage, varies within and between waterbird species. Here, we investigate under controlled conditions how the interaction between seed traits and digestive strategies affect the germinability of seeds following waterbird-mediated dispersal. We exposed seeds of 30 wetland plant species to the main digestive processes in the dabbling duck digestive system: mechanical, chemical and intestinal digestion. These were simulated by 1) a pressure test and scarification treatment, 2) incubation in simulated gastric juice, and 3) incubation in intestinal contents of culled mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). We evaluated their separate and combined effects on seed germination, and identified the role of seed size and seed coat traits in resisting the digestive forces. Seeds were generally resistant to separate digestive processes, but highly sensitive to a combination. Resistance to mechanical break-down was reduced by up to 80% by chemical pre-treatment, especially for seeds with permeable coats. Scarified seeds were 12-17% more vulnerable to chemical and intestinal digestive processes than undamaged seeds. Large seeds and seeds with thin, permeable coats were particularly sensitive to chemical and intestinal digestion. These results indicate that efficient digestion of seeds requires multiple digestive processes. The gizzard, responsible for mechanical digestion, plays a key role in seed survival. Omnivorous birds, which have relatively light gizzards compared to pure herbivores or granivores, are thus most likely to disperse seeds successfully. Regardless of digestive strategy, small seeds with tough seed coats are most resistant to digestion and may be adapted to endozoochorous dispersal by waterbirds."
"Around 0.3% of newborns will develop autoimmunity to pancreatic beta cells in childhood and subsequently develop type 1 diabetes before adulthood. Primary prevention of type 1 diabetes will require early intervention in genetically at-risk infants. The objective of this study was to determine to what extent genetic scores (two previous genetic scores and a merged genetic score) can improve the prediction of type 1 diabetes.The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study followed genetically at-risk children at 3- to 6-monthly intervals from birth for the development of islet autoantibodies and type 1 diabetes. Infants were enrolled between 1 September 2004 and 28 February 2010 and monitored until 31 May 2016. The risk (positive predictive value) for developing multiple islet autoantibodies (pre-symptomatic type 1 diabetes) and type 1 diabetes was determined in 4,543 children who had no first-degree relatives with type 1 diabetes and either a heterozygous HLA DR3 and DR4-DQ8 risk genotype or a homozygous DR4-DQ8 genotype, and in 3,498 of these children in whom genetic scores were calculated from 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms. In the children with the HLA risk genotypes, risk for developing multiple islet autoantibodies was 5.8% (95% CI 5.0%-6.6%) by age 6 years, and risk for diabetes by age 10 years was 3.7% (95% CI 3.0%-4.4%). Risk for developing multiple islet autoantibodies was 11.0% (95% CI 8.7%-13.3%) in children with a merged genetic score of >14.4 (upper quartile; n = 907) compared to 4.1% (95% CI 3.3%-4.9%, P < 0.001) in children with a genetic score of ?14.4 (n = 2,591). Risk for developing diabetes by age 10 years was 7.6% (95% CI 5.3%-9.9%) in children with a merged score of >14.4 compared with 2.7% (95% CI 1.9%-3.6%) in children with a score of ?14.4 (P < 0.001). Of 173 children with multiple islet autoantibodies by age 6 years and 107 children with diabetes by age 10 years, 82 (sensitivity, 47.4%; 95% CI 40.1%-54.8%) and 52 (sensitivity, 48.6%, 95% CI 39.3%-60.0%), respectively, had a score >14.4. Scores were higher in European versus US children (P = 0.003). In children with a merged score of >14.4, risk for multiple islet autoantibodies was similar and consistently >10% in Europe and in the US; risk was greater in males than in females (P = 0.01). Limitations of the study include that the genetic scores were originally developed from case-control studies of clinical diabetes in individuals of mainly European decent. It is, therefore, possible that it may not be suitable to all populations.A type 1 diabetes genetic score identified infants without family history of type 1 diabetes who had a greater than 10% risk for pre-symptomatic type 1 diabetes, and a nearly 2-fold higher risk than children identified by high-risk HLA genotypes alone. This finding extends the possibilities for enrolling children into type 1 diabetes primary prevention trials."
"Discovering regulatory interactions between genes that specify the behavioral properties of cells remains an important challenge. We used the dynamics of transcriptional changes resolved by PRO-seq to identify a regulatory network responsible for endocrine resistance in breast cancer. We show that GDNF leads to endocrine resistance by switching the active state in a bi-stable feedback loop between GDNF, EGR1, and the master transcription factor ER?. GDNF stimulates MAP kinase, activating the transcription factors SRF and AP-1. SRF initiates an immediate transcriptional response, activating EGR1 and suppressing ER?. Newly translated EGR1 protein activates endogenous GDNF, leading to constitutive GDNF and EGR1 up-regulation, and the sustained down-regulation of ER?. Endocrine resistant MCF-7 cells are constitutively in the GDNF-high/ ER?-low state, suggesting that the state in the bi-stable feedback loop may provide a 'memory' of endocrine resistance. Thus, we identified a regulatory network switch that contributes to drug resistance in breast cancer."
"Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics."
"In an Essay, Michael Johansson and colleagues advocate the posting of research studies addressing infectious disease outbreaks as preprints."
"Phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, is well known because of its beautiful geometric configuration, which is derived from the constant spacing between leaf primordia. This phyllotaxis is established by mutual interaction between a diffusible plant hormone auxin and its efflux carrier PIN1, which cooperatively generate a regular pattern of auxin maxima, small regions with high auxin concentrations, leading to leaf primordia. However, the molecular mechanism of the regular pattern of auxin maxima is still largely unknown. To better understand how the phyllotaxis pattern is controlled, we investigated mathematical models based on the auxin-PIN1 interaction through linear stability analysis and numerical simulations, focusing on the spatial regularity control of auxin maxima. As in previous reports, we first confirmed that this spatial regularity can be reproduced by a highly simplified and abstract model. However, this model lacks the extracellular region and is not appropriate for considering the molecular mechanism. Thus, we investigated how auxin maxima patterns are affected under more realistic conditions. We found that the spatial regularity is eliminated by introducing the extracellular region, even in the presence of direct diffusion between cells or between extracellular spaces, and this strongly suggests the existence of an unknown molecular mechanism. To unravel this mechanism, we assumed a diffusible molecule to verify various feedback interactions with auxin-PIN1 dynamics. We revealed that regular patterns can be restored by a diffusible molecule that mediates the signaling from auxin to PIN1 polarization. Furthermore, as in the one-dimensional case, similar results are observed in the two-dimensional space. These results provide a great insight into the theoretical and molecular basis for understanding the phyllotaxis pattern. Our theoretical analysis strongly predicts a diffusible molecule that is pivotal for the phyllotaxis pattern but is yet to be determined experimentally."
"Single-cell transcriptomics has been used for analysis of heterogeneous populations of cells during developmental processes and for analysis of tumor cell heterogeneity. More recently, analysis of pseudotime (PT) dynamics of heterogeneous cell populations has been established as a powerful concept to study developmental processes. Here we perform PT analysis of 3 melanoma short-term cultures with different genetic backgrounds to study specific and concordant properties of PT dynamics of selected cellular programs with impact on melanoma progression. Overall, in our setting of melanoma cells PT dynamics towards higher tumor malignancy appears to be largely driven by cell cycle genes. Single cells of all three short-term cultures show a bipolar expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) signatures. Furthermore, opposing gene expression changes are observed for genes regulated by epigenetic mechanisms suggesting epigenetic reprogramming during melanoma progression. The three melanoma short-term cultures show common themes of PT dynamics such as a stromal signature at initiation, bipolar expression of the MITF/AXL signature and opposing regulation of poised and activated promoters. Differences are observed at the late stage of PT dynamics with high, low or intermediate MITF and anticorrelated AXL signatures. These findings may help to identify targets for interference at different stages of tumor progression."
"Chromosomal interactions connect distant enhancers and promoters on the same chromosome, activating or repressing gene expression.PEAR1encodes the Platelet-Endothelial Aggregation Receptor 1, a contact receptor involved in platelet function and megakaryocyte and endothelial cell proliferation.PEAR1expression during megakaryocyte differentiation is controlled by DNA methylation at its first CpG island. We identified aPEAR1cell-specific methylation sensitive region in endothelial cells and megakaryocytes that showed strong chromosomal interactions withISGL20L2,RRNAD1,MRLP24,HDGFandPRCC, using available promoter capture Hi-C datasets. These genes are involved in ribosome processing, protein synthesis, cell cycle and cell proliferation. We next studied the methylation and expression profile of these five genes in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) and megakaryocyte precursors. While cell-specificPEAR1methylation corresponded to variability in expression for four out of five genes, no methylation change was observed in their promoter regions across cell types. Our data suggest thatPEAR1cell-type specific methylation changes may control long distance interactions with other genes. Further studies are needed to show whether such interaction data might be relevant for the genome-wide association data that showed a role for non-codingPEAR1variants in the same region and platelet function, platelet count and cardiovascular risk."
"Exposure to Formaldehyde (FA) results in many pathophysiological symptoms, however the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Given the complicated modulatory role of intestinal microbiota on human health, we hypothesized that interactions between FA and the gut microbiome may account for FA's toxicity. Balb/c mice were allocated randomly to three groups: a control group, a methanol group (0.1 and 0.3 ng/mL MeOH subgroups), and an FA group (1 and 3 ng/mL FA subgroups). Groups of either three or six mice were used for the control or experiment. We applied high-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene approaches and investigated possible alterations in the composition of mouse gut microbiota induced by FA. Changes in bacterial genera induced by FA exposure were identified. By analyzing KEGG metabolic pathways predicted by PICRUSt software, we also explored the potential metabolic changes, such as alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism and pathways in cancer, associated with FA exposure in mice. To the best of our knowledge, this preliminary study is the first to identify changes in the mouse gut microbiome after FA exposure, and to analyze the relevant potential metabolisms. The limitation of this study: this study is relatively small and needs to be further confirmed through a larger study."
"Reinforcement is the process by which selection against hybridization increases reproductive isolation between taxa. Much research has focused on demonstrating the existence of reinforcement, yet relatively little is known about the genetic basis of reinforcement or the evolutionary conditions under which reinforcement can occur. Inspired by reinforcement's characteristic phenotypic pattern of reproductive trait divergence in sympatry but not in allopatry, we discuss whether reinforcement also leaves a distinct genomic pattern. First, we describe three patterns of genetic variation we expect as a consequence of reinforcement. Then, we discuss a set of alternative processes and complicating factors that may make the identification of reinforcement at the genomic level difficult. Finally, we consider how genomic analyses can be leveraged to inform if and to what extent reinforcement evolved in the face of gene flow between sympatric lineages and between allopatric and sympatric populations of the same lineage. Our major goals are to understand if genome scans for particular patterns of genetic variation could identify reinforcement, isolate the genetic basis of reinforcement, or infer the conditions under which reinforcement evolved."
"Cyanobacteria synthesize a large variety of secondary metabolites including toxins. Microcystins (MCs) with hepato- and neurotoxic potential are well studied in bloom-forming planktonic species of temperate and tropical regions. Cyanobacterial biofilms thriving in the polar regions have recently emerged as a rich source for cyanobacterial secondary metabolites including previously undescribed congeners of microcystin. However, detection and detailed identification of these compounds is difficult due to unusual sample matrices and structural congeners produced. We here report a time-efficient liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) precursor ion screening method that facilitates microcystin detection and identification. We applied this method to detect six different MC congeners in 8 out of 26 microbial mat samples of the Svalbard Archipelago in the Arctic. The congeners, of which [Asp³, ADMAdda?, Dhb?] MC-LR was most abundant, were similar to those reported in other polar habitats. Microcystins were also determined using an Adda-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Adda-ELISA).Nostocsp. was identified as a putative toxin producer using molecular methods that targeted 16S rRNA genes and genes involved in microcystin production. Themcygenes detected showed highest similarities to other Arctic or Antarctic sequences. The LC-MS precursor ion screening method could be useful for microcystin detection in unusual matrices such as benthic biofilms or lichen."
"The biological clock has received increasing interest due to its key role in regulating body homeostasis in a time-dependent manner. Cancer development and progression has been linked to a disrupted molecular clock; however, in melanoma, the role of the biological clock is largely unknown. We investigated the effects of the tumor on its micro- (TME) and macro-environments (TMaE) in a non-metastatic melanoma model. C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with murine B16-F10 melanoma cells and 2 weeks later the animals were euthanized every 6 h during 24 h. The presence of a localized tumor significantly impaired the biological clock of tumor-adjacent skin and affected the oscillatory expression of genes involved in light- and thermo-reception, proliferation, melanogenesis, and DNA repair. The expression of tumor molecular clock was significantly reduced compared to healthy skin but still displayed an oscillatory profile. We were able to cluster the affected genes using a human database and distinguish between primary melanoma and healthy skin. The molecular clocks of lungs and liver (common sites of metastasis), and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) were significantly affected by tumor presence, leading to chronodisruption in each organ. Taken altogether, the presence of non-metastatic melanoma significantly impairs the organism's biological clocks. We suggest that the clock alterations found in TME and TMaE could impact development, progression, and metastasis of melanoma; thus, making the molecular clock an interesting pharmacological target."
"Colorectal cancer is the third most widely diagnosed cancer. Extracts from snails may modulate growth and development of colorectal cancer cells. The objective of this study was to determine the chemical composition of tissues derived fromHelix aspersaMüller and red-ox properties of tissue extracts. Then, the influence of extracts and their fractions of different molecular weights on viability of Caco-2 cells was examined. Tissue lyophilisates contained antioxidants that could be important in the prevention of colorectal cancer. Moreover, we confirmed the presence of a wide array of compounds that might be used in treatment of this disease. The decrease of cell viability after the application of extracts from lyophilized mucus and foot tissues was affirmed. The effect of extract from mucus could be related to the content of some proteins and peptides, proper essential amino acids (EAA)/non-essential amino acids (NEAA) ratio, Met restriction and the presence of Cu, Ca, Zn, Se. The influence of the extract from foot tissues could be assigned additionally to the presence of eicosapentaenoic, ?-linolenic, linoleic and ?-linolenic acids. The opposite effect was demonstrated by extract from lyophilized shells which increased cell viability. Further studies are needed to know whether dietary supplying ofH. aspersaMüller tissues can be used as an approach in colorectal cancer management."
"Flavonoids are structurally diverse secondary metabolites in plants, with a multitude of functions. These span from functions in regulating plant development, pigmentation, and UV protection, to an array of roles in defence and signalling between plants and microorganisms. Because of their prevalence in the human diet, many flavonoids constitute important components of medicinal plants and are used in the control of inflammation and cancer prevention. Advances in the elucidation of flavonoid biosynthesis and its regulation have led to an increasing number of studies aimed at engineering the flavonoid pathway for enhancing nutritional value and plant defences against pathogens and herbivores, as well as modifying the feeding value of pastures. Many future opportunities await for the exploitation of this colourful pathway in crops, pastures, and medicinal plants."
"Recently, aSalmonellaTyphi isolate producing CTX-M-15 extended spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL) and with decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility was isolated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We have selected bacteriophages that show strong lytic activity against this isolate and have potential for phage-based treatment ofS. Typhi, andSalmonellain general."
"Insect G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have important roles in modulating biology, physiology and behavior. They have been identified as candidate targets for next-generation insecticides, yet these targets have been relatively poorly exploited for insect control. In this study, we present a pipeline of novelManduca sextaallatotropin (Manse-AT) antagonist discovery with homology modeling, docking, molecular dynamics simulation and structure-activity relationship. A series of truncated and alanine-replacement analogs of Manse-AT were assayed for the stimulation of juvenile hormone biosynthesis. The minimum sequence required to retain potent biological activity is theC-terminal amidated octapeptide Manse-AT (6-13). We identified three residues essential for bioactivity (Thr?, Arg6 and Phe?) by assaying alanine-replacement analogs of Manse-AT (6-13). Alanine replacement of other residues resulted in reduced potency but bioactivity was retained. The 3D structure of the receptor (Manse-ATR) was built and the binding pocket was identified. The binding affinities of all the analogs were estimated by calculating the free energy of binding. The calculated binding affinities corresponded to the biological activities of the analogs, which supporting our localization of the binding pocket. Then, based on the docking and molecular dynamics studies of Manse-AT (10-13), we described it can act as a potent Manse-AT antagonist. The antagonistic effect on JH biosynthesis of Manse-AT (10-13) validated our hypothesis. The IC50value of antagonist Manse-AT (10-13) is 0.9 nM. The structure-activity relationship of antagonist Manse-AT (10-13) was also studied for the further purpose of investigating theoretically the structure factors influencing activity. These data will be useful for the design of new Manse-AT agonist and antagonist as potential pest control agents."
"Pulmonary infections of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) occur very early in the disease. The molecular details that cause infection-susceptibility of CF patients to and mediate infection with S. aureus are poorly characterized. Therefore, we aimed to identify the role of ?-toxin, a major S. aureus toxin, for pulmonary infection of CF mice. Infection with S. aureus JE2 resulted in severe pneumonia in CF mice, while wildtype mice were almost unaffected. Deficiency of ?-toxin in JE2-?hla reduced pathogenicity of S. aureus in CF mice. However, CF mice were still more susceptible to the mutant S. aureus strain than wildtype mice. The S. aureus JE2 induced marked increase of ceramide and a downregulation of sphingosine and acid ceramidase expression in bronchi of CF mice. Deletion of ?-toxin reduced these changes after infection of CF mice. Similar changes were observed in wildtype mice, but at much lower levels. Our data indicate that expression of ?-toxin is a major factor causing S. aureus infections in CF mice. Wildtype S. aureus induces a marked increase of ceramide and a reduction of sphingosine and acid ceramidase expression in bronchial epithelial cells of wildtype and CF mice, changes that determine infection susceptibility."
"Chemotherapy-induced hemorrhagic cystitis (CHC) can be difficult to manage. Prior work suggests that IL-4 alleviates ifosfamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis (IHC), but systemically administered IL-4 causes significant side effects. We hypothesized that the Schistosoma hematobium homolog of IL-4-inducing principle from Schistosoma mansoni eggs (H-IPSE), would reduce IHC and associated bladder pathology. IPSE binds IgE on basophils and mast cells, triggering IL-4 secretion by these cells. IPSE is also an ""infiltrin,"" translocating into the host nucleus to modulate gene transcription. Mice were administered IL-4, H-IPSE protein or its nuclear localization sequence (NLS) mutant, with or without neutralizing anti-IL-4 antibody, or 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium (MESNA; a drug used to prevent IHC), followed by ifosfamide. Bladder tissue damage and hemoglobin content were measured. Spontaneous and evoked pain, urinary frequency, and bladdergene expression analysis were assessed. Pain behaviors were interpreted in a blinded fashion. One dose of H-IPSE was superior to MESNA and IL-4 in suppressing bladder hemorrhage in an IL-4-dependent fashion and comparable with MESNA in dampening ifosfamide-triggered pain behaviors in an NLS-dependent manner. H-IPSE also accelerated urothelial repair following IHC. Our work represents the first therapeutic exploitation of a uropathogen-derived host modulatory molecule in a clinically relevant bladder disease model and indicates that IPSE may be an alternative to MESNA for mitigating CHC.-Mbanefo, E.

"Genomic imprinting is the process of epigenetic modification whereby genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin dependent manner; it plays an important role in normal growth and development. Parthenogenetic embryos contain only the maternal genome. Parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells could be useful for studying imprinted genes. In humans, ovarian mature cystic teratomas originate from parthenogenetic activation of oocytes; they are composed of highly differentiated mature tissues containing all three germ layers. To establish human parthenogenetic induced pluripotent stem cell lines (PgHiPSCs), we generated parthenogenetic fibroblasts from ovarian teratoma tissues. We compared global DNA methylation status of PgHiPSCs with that of biparental human induced pluripotent stem cells by using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. This analysis identified novel single imprinted CpG sites. We further tested DNA methylation patterns of two of these sites using bisulfite sequencing and described novel candidate imprinted CpG sites. These results confirm that PgHiPSCs are a powerful tool for identifying imprinted genes and investigating their roles in human development and diseases."
"To assess the survival of G. anatis in dead laying hens, 21-week old laying hens were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml brain hearth infusion broth containing 108 CFU of G. anatis 12656-12 liver (n=16), E. coli ST141(n=16), or a mix of G. anatis 12656-12 liver (n=16) and E. coli ST141 (n=16), respectively. Birds were euthanized 24 hours post injection and eight dead birds were kept at 4°C and room temperature, respectively. Swab samples were taken at different time points post euthanization and streaked on blood agar plates. From the birds kept at 4 °C, G. anatis was re-isolated from the G. anatis and the G. anatis/E. coli co-injected groups at least 12 days post euthanization. From birds kept at room temperature, G. anatis was re-isolated up to 48 hours post euthanization. When using the gyrB based G. anatis-specific qPCR G. anatis was detected at least 120 hours and up to 96 hours post euthanized from birds kept at room temperature and 4°C, respectively. E. coli was re-isolated from all the time points independent of how the birds were kept. No difference was observed between the re-isolation rates for G. anatis or E. coli when comparing similar detection methods. For birds kept at 4°C, bacterial cultivation was a more sensitive detection method to detect G. anatis (P<0.05), while for birds kept at room temperature the G. anatis-specific qPCR out performed bacterial culture (P<0.05). In conclusion, we demonstrated that G. anatis has a poorer survival than E. coli in dead chickens kept at room temperature. That may affect the overall diagnostic sensitivity and lead to underdiagnosing of G. anatis in a normal production setting."
"Developing efficient and low-cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes is a pressing but still challenging task for energy conversion technologies such as water electrolysis, regenerative fuel cells, and rechargeable metal-air batteries. Hence, this study reports that a nickel oxide-nickel hybrid nanoarray on nickel foam (NiO-Ni/NF) could act as a versatile anode for superior water and urea oxidation. Impressively, this anode could attain high current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm-2at extremely low overpotentials of 292 and 323 mV for OER, respectively. Besides, this electrode also shows excellent activity for urea oxidation with the need for just 0.28 and 0.36 V (vs SCE) to attain 10 and 100 mA cm-2in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea, respectively. The enhanced oxidation performance should be due to the synergistic effect of NiO and Ni, improved conductivity, and enlarged active surface area."
"Morphology-guided cell-based screening of the extract of a Mycale sp. marine sponge led to the isolation of two trisoxazole macrolides, miuramides A (1) and B (2), which induced characteristic morphological changes in 3Y1 cells. The structure of 1 including absolute configuration was elucidated by a combination of the analysis of spectroscopic data, derivatization, and degradation. Both compounds exhibit potent cytotoxicity against 3Y1 cells."
"As has long been understood, the noise on a spectrometric signal can be reduced by averaging over time, and the averaged noise is expected to decrease as t1/2, the square root of the data collection time. However, with contemporary capability for fast data collection and storage, we can retain and access a great deal more information about a signal train than just its average over time. During the same collection time, we can record the signal averaged over much shorter, equal, fixed periods. This is, then, the set of signals over submultiples of the total collection time. With a sufficiently large set of submultiples, the distribution of the signal's fluctuations over the submultiple periods of the data stream can be acquired at each wavelength (or frequency). From the autocorrelations of submultiple sets, we find only some fraction of these fluctuations consist of stochastic noise. Part of the fluctuations are what we call ""fast drift"", which is defined as drift over a time shorter than the complete measurement period of the average spectrum. In effect, what is usually assumed to be stochastic noise has a significant component of fast drift due to changes of conditions in the spectroscopic system. In addition, we show that the extreme values of the fluctuation of the signals are usually not balanced (equal magnitudes, equal probabilities) on either side of the mean or median without an inconveniently long measurement time; the data is almost inevitably biased. In other words, the unbalanced data is collected in an unbalanced manner around the mean, and so the median provides a better measure of the true spectrum. As is shown here, by using the medians of these distributions, the signal-to-noise of the spectrum can be increased and sampling bias reduced. The effect of this submultiple median data treatment is demonstrated for infrared, circular dichroism, and Raman spectrometry."
"Molecular chaperones play a central role in protein homeostasis (a.k.a. proteostasis) by balancing protein folding, quality control, and turnover. To perform these diverse tasks, chaperones need the malleability to bind nearly any ""client"" protein and the fidelity to detect when it is misfolded. Remarkably, these activities are carried out by only ?180 dedicated chaperones in humans. How do a relatively small number of chaperones maintain cellular and organismal proteostasis for an entire proteome? Furthermore, once a chaperone binds a client, how does it ""decide"" what to do with it? One clue comes from observations that individual chaperones engage in protein-protein interactions (PPIs)-both with each other and with their clients. These physical links coordinate multiple chaperones into organized, functional complexes and facilitate the ""handoff"" of clients between them. PPIs also link chaperones and their clients to other cellular pathways, such as those that mediate trafficking (e.g., cytoskeleton) and degradation (e.g., proteasome). The PPIs of the chaperone network have a wide range of affinity values (nanomolar to micromolar) and involve many distinct types of domain modules, such as J domains, zinc fingers, and tetratricopeptide repeats. Many of these motifs have the same binding surfaces on shared partners, such that members of one chaperone class often compete for the same interactions. Somehow, this collection of PPIs draws together chaperone families and creates multiprotein subnetworks that are able to make the ""decisions"" of protein quality control. The key to understanding chaperone-mediated proteostasis might be to understand how PPIs are regulated. This Account will discuss the efforts of our group and others to map, measure, and chemically perturb the PPIs within the molecular chaperone network. Structural biology methods, including X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and electron microscopy, have all played important roles in visualizing the chaperone PPIs. Guided by these efforts and -omics approaches to measure PPIs, new advances in high-throughput chemical screening that are specially designed to account for the challenges of this system have emerged. Indeed, chemical biology has played a particularly important role in this effort, as molecules that either promote or inhibit specific PPIs have proven to be invaluable research probes in cells and animals. In addition, these molecules have provided leads for the potential treatment of protein misfolding diseases. One of the major products of this research field has been the identification of putative PPI drug targets within the chaperone network, which might be used to change chaperone ""decisions"" and rebalance proteostasis."
"Quantification of leaf respiration is important for understanding plant physiology and ecosystem biogeochemical processes. Leaf respiration continues in the light (RL) but supposedly at a lower rate than in the dark (RDk). However, there is no method for direct measurement of RLand the available methods require nonphysiological measurement conditions. A method based on isotopic disequilibrium quantified RL(RL13C) and mesophyll conductance of young and old fully expanded leaves of six species. RL13Cwas compared to RLdetermined by the Laisk method (RL Laisk) on the very same leaves with a minimum time lag. RL 13Cand RL Laiskwere generally lower than RDk, and were not significantly affected by leaf ageing. RL Laiskand RL 13Cwere positively correlated (r2 = 0.35), and both were positively correlated with RDk(r2 ? 0.6). RL Laiskwas systematically lower than RL 13Cby 0.4 ?mol m-2 s-1. Using A/Ccinstead of A/Cicurves, a higher photocompensation point ?* (by 5 ?mol mol-1) was found but no influence on RL Laiskestimates was observed. The results imply that the Laisk method underestimates actual RLsignificantly, probably related to the measurement condition of low CO2and irradiance. The isotopic disequilibrium method is useful for assessing responses of RLto irradiance and CO2, improving our mechanistic understanding of RL."
"In this work, we have characterized the C-19+ gene cluster (MSMEG_2851 to MSMEG_2901) of Mycobacterium smegmatis. By in silico analysis we have identified the genes encoding enzymes involved in the modification of the A/B steroid rings during the catabolism of C-19 steroids in certain M. smegmatis mutants mapped in the PadR-like regulator (MSMEG_2868), that constitutively express the C-19+ gene cluster. By using gene complementation assays, resting-cell biotransformations and deletion mutants, we have characterized the most critical genes of the cluster, i.e, kstD2, kstD3, kshA2, kshB2, hsaA2, hsaC2 and hsaD2. These results have allowed us to propose a new catabolic route named C-19+ pathway for the mineralization of C-19 steroids in M. smegmatis. Our data suggest that the deletion of the C-19+ gene cluster may be useful to engineer more robust and efficient M. smegmatis strains to produce C-19 steroids from sterols. Moreover, the new KshA2, KshB2, KstD2 and KstD3 isoenzymes may be useful to design new microbial cell factories for the 9?-hydroxylation and/or ?1-dehydrogenation of 3-ketosteroids.

"During secondary growth in most eudicots and gymnosperms, the periderm replaces the epidermis as the frontier tissue protecting the vasculature from biotic and abiotic stresses. Despite its importance, the mechanisms underlying periderm establishment and formation are largely unknown. The herbaceous Arabidopsis thaliana undergoes secondary growth, including periderm formation in the root and hypocotyl. Thus, we focused on these two organs to establish a framework to study periderm development in a model organism. We identified a set of characteristic developmental stages describing periderm growth from the first cell division in the pericycle to the shedding of the cortex and epidermis. We highlight that two independent mechanisms are involved in the loosening of the outer tissues as the endodermis undergoes programmed cell death, whereas the epidermis and the cortex are abscised. Moreover, the phellem of Arabidopsis, as in trees, is suberized, lignified and peels off. In addition, putative regulators from oak and potato are also expressed in the Arabidopsis periderm. Collectively, the periderm of Arabidopsis shares many characteristics/features of woody and tuberous periderms, rendering Arabidopsis thaliana an attractive model for cork biology."
"Flowering time (heading date) in rice (Oryza sativa) is an important agronomic trait that determines yield. The levels of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) modulated by TRITHORAX-like proteins regulate gene transcription, flowering time and environmental stress responses. However, plant TRITHORAX-like proteins have no known DNA-binding domain, and therefore the mechanism that gives sequence specificity to these proteins remains unclear. Here, we show that the rice TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1 is recruited to its target, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), by the C2H2 zinc finger protein SDG723/OsTrx1/OsSET33 Interaction Protein 1 (SIP1). SIP1 binds to the promoter of Ehd1 and interacts with OsTrx1. Mutations in SIP1 led to a late heading date under long-day and short-day conditions. Defects in OsTrx1 or SIP1 led to reduced H3K4me3 levels at Ehd1, thus reducing Ehd1 expression. Together, our results show that the transcription factor SIP1 interacts with OxTrx1, allowing OsTrx1 to specifically target Ehd1, altering H3K4me3 levels, increasing Ehd1 expression and thereby promoting flowering."
"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a type of vascular malformation characterised by an abnormal connection between arteries and veins, bypassing the capillary system. This absence of capillaries generates an elevated pressure (hyperdebit), in both the AVM and the venous drainage, increasing the risk of rupture. Management modalities are: observation, microsurgical clipping, endovascular treatment and radiosurgery. The former can be used alone or in the frame of a multidisciplinary approach. We review our single-institution experience with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) over a period of 5 years.The study was open-label, prospective and nonrandomised. Fifty-seven consecutive patients, benefitting from 64 GKR treatments, were included. All were treated with Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion (Elekta Instruments, AB, Sweden) between July 2010 and August 2015. All underwent stereotactic multimodal imaging: standard digital subtraction angiography, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography. We report obliteration rates, radiation-induced complications and haemorrhages during follow-up course.The mean age was 46 years (range 13-79 years). The mean follow-up period was 36.4 months (median 38, range 12-75 months). Most common pretherapeutic clinical presentation was haemorrhage (50%). The most common Pollock-Flickinger score was between 1.01 and 1.5 (46%) and Spetzler-Martin grade III (46%). In 39 (60.1%) of cases, GKR was performed as upfront therapeutic option. The mean gross target volume (GTV) was 2.3 ml (median 1.2, range 0.03-11.3 ml). Mean marginal dose was 22.4 Gy (median 24, range 18-24 Gy). The mean prescription isodose volume (PIV) was 2.9 ml (median 1.8, range 0.065-14.6 ml). The overall obliteration rates (all treatments combined) at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months were 4.8, 16.9%, 37.4, 63.6 and 78.4%, respectively. The main predictive factors for complete obliteration were: higher mean marginal dose (23.3 vs 21.0 Gy), lower GTV (mean 1.5 vs 3.5 ml) and absence of previous embolisation (at 60 months 61.8% prior embolisation compared with 82.4% without prior embolisation) (for all p <0.05). Eight (14%) patients experienced complications after GKR. Overall definitive morbidity rate was 3.1%. No patient died from causes related to GKR. However, during the obliteration period, one case of extremely rare fatal haemorrhage occurred.Radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment modality for intracranial AVMs in selected cases. It can be used as upfront therapy or in the frame of a combined management. Obliteration rates are high, with minimal morbidity. The treatment effect is progressive and subsequent and regular clinical and radiological follow-up is needed to evaluate this effect."
"A common strategy by which developing neurons locate their synaptic partners is through projections to circuit-specific neuropil sublayers. Once established, sublayers serve as a substrate for selective synapse formation, but how sublayers arise during neurodevelopment remains unknown. Here we identify the earliest events that initiate formation of the direction-selective circuit in the inner plexiform layer of mouse retina. We demonstrate that radially-migrating newborn starburst amacrine cells establish homotypic contacts on arrival at the inner retina. These contacts, mediated by the cell-surface protein MEGF10, trigger neuropil innervation resulting in generation of two sublayers comprising starburst-cell dendrites. This dendritic scaffold then recruits projections from circuit partners. Abolishing MEGF10-mediated contacts profoundly delays and ultimately disrupts sublayer formation, leading to broader direction tuning and weaker direction-selectivity in retinal ganglion cells. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which differentiating neurons transition from migratory to mature morphology, and highlight this mechanism's importance in forming circuit-specific sublayers."
"In theDrosophilacircadian clock, Period (PER) and Timeless (TIM) proteins inhibit Clock-mediated transcription ofperandtimgenes until PER is degraded by Doubletime/CK1 (DBT)-mediated phosphorylation, establishing a negative feedback loop. Multiple regulatory delays within this feedback loop ensure ~24 hr periodicity. Of these delays, the mechanisms that regulate delayed PER degradation (and Clock reactivation) remain unclear. Here we show that phosphorylation of certain DBT target sites within a central region of PER affect PER inhibition of Clock and the stability of the PER/TIM complex. Our results indicate that phosphorylation of PER residue S589 stabilizes and activates PER inhibitory function in the presence of TIM, but promotes PER degradation in its absence. The role of DBT in regulating PER activity, stabilization and degradation ensures that these events are chronologically and biochemically linked, and contributes to the timing of an essential delay that influences the period of the circadian clock."
"Magnesium ions (Mg2+) are divalent cations essential for various cellular functions. Mg2+homeostasis is maintained through Mg2+channels such as MgtE, a prokaryotic Mg2+channel whose gating is regulated by intracellular Mg2+levels. Our previous crystal structure of MgtE in the Mg2+-bound, closed state revealed the existence of seven crystallographically-independent Mg2+-binding sites, Mg1-Mg7. The role of Mg2+-binding to each site in channel closure remains unknown. Here, we investigated Mg2+-dependent changes in the structure and dynamics of MgtE using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mg2+-titration experiments, using wild-type and mutant forms of MgtE, revealed that the Mg2+binding sites Mg1, Mg2, Mg3, and Mg6, exhibited cooperativity and a higher affinity for Mg2+, enabling the remaining Mg2+binding sites, Mg4, Mg5, and Mg7, to play important roles in channel closure. This study revealed the role of each Mg2+-binding site in MgtE gating, underlying the mechanism of cellular Mg2+homeostasis."
"Quickly and accurately extracting information about a touched object's orientation is a critical aspect of dexterous object manipulation. However, the speed and acuity of tactile edge orientation processing with respect to the fingertips as reported in previous perceptual studies appear inadequate in these respects. Here we directly establish the tactile system's capacity to process edge-orientation information during dexterous manipulation. Participants extracted tactile information about edge orientation very quickly, using it within 200 ms of first touching the object. Participants were also strikingly accurate. With edges spanning the entire fingertip, edge-orientation resolution was better than 3° in our object manipulation task, which is several times better than reported in previous perceptual studies. Performance remained impressive even with edges as short as 2 mm, consistent with our ability to precisely manipulate very small objects. Taken together, our results radically redefine the spatial processing capacity of the tactile system."
"Freshly released pollen of black elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) was incubated under various culture conditions until germination was achieved. Optimal conditions for germination were determined and used for maturation of unicellular microspores in vitro. Staining with 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, propidium iodide and iodine potassium iodide was used to assess pollen viability, nuclear phase and maturation, respectively. The germination rate was highest when fresh pollen was agitated at 40 rpm in Petri dishes containing a liquid medium consisting of Brewbaker and Kwack salts, 15% (w/v) sucrose, 500 mg/l MES sodium salt, at pH 5.0; germination reached nearly 70% after only 1 h in culture. Under these conditions, and with addition of 200 mg/l glutamine, 260 mg/l cytidine and 500 mg/l uridine, uninucleate microspores developed into mature pollen at a 12% germination rate. Our report is the first demonstration of maturation of S. nigra microspores in vitro."
"We investigated the effects of thymoquinone (TQ) on the expression of liver microRNAs (miRNAs), liver histopathology and oxidative stress in Ehrlich acid solid tumor model induced mice. We used 24 male BALB/c mice divided randomly into three groups. Control (C) group mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.5 ml saline for four weeks. Tumor (T) group mice were injected i.p. with 0.5 ml saline for four weeks, then Ehrlich acid tumor cells were injected subcutaneously into the neck to induce solid tumor formation. TQ (T + Tq) group mice injected i.p. with 10 mg/kg TQ for four weeks, then Ehrlich acid tumor cells were injected subcutaneously into the neck of the mice in this group to induce solid tumor formation. At the end of the study, liver from all groups were removed for histopathological and miRNAs analysis, and oxidative stress measurement. We found that the expression of miR-206b-3p was up-regulated and the oxidative stress and necrosis increased in the liver tissue of mice with Ehrlich acid solid tumor. TQ application decreased the oxidative stress, prevented necrosis, increased regeneration and down-regulated the expression of miR-206b-3p in the liver tissue."
"It is widely appreciated that the addition of salts to water leads to significant changes in the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of these aqueous solutions that have great significance in biology and manufacturing applications. However, no theoretical framework currently exists that describes these property changes in an internally consistent fashion. In previous work, we developed a coarse-grained model of electrolyte solutions capable of reproducing basic trends on how salts influence the viscosity and water diffusion coefficient. The present work explores the predictions of this model for basic thermodynamic properties of electrolyte solutions, namely, the density, isothermal compressibility, and surface tension. On the basis of our model, we find that ion-specific effects on thermodynamics properties, and by extension the dynamics of electrolyte solutions, derive primarily from ion solvation."
"New ruthenium methyl-cyclopentadienyl compounds bearing bipyridine derivatives with the general formula [Ru(?5-MeCp)(PPh3)(4,4'-R-2,2'-bpy)]+(Ru1, R = H; Ru2, R = CH3; and Ru3, R = CH2OH) have been synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic and analytical techniques. Ru1 crystallized in the monoclinic P21/ c, Ru2 in the triclinic P1?, and Ru3 in the monoclinic P21/ n space group. In all molecular structures, the ruthenium center adopts a ""piano stool"" distribution. Density functional theory calculations were performed for all complexes, and the results support spectroscopic data. Ru1 and Ru3 were poor substrates of the main multidrug resistance human pumps, ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC1, and ABCC2, while Ru2 displayed inhibitory properties of ABCC1 and ABCC2 pumps. Importantly, all compounds displayed a very high cytotoxic profile for ovarian cancer cells (sensitive and resistant) that was much more pronounced than that observed with cisplatin, making them very promising anticancer agents."
"The P-cluster of the nitrogenase MoFe protein is a [ Fe8S7] cluster that mediates efficient transfer of electrons to the active site for substrate reduction. Arguably the most complex homometallic FeS cluster found in nature, the biosynthetic mechanism of the P-cluster is of considerable theoretical and synthetic interest to chemists and biochemists alike. Previous studies have revealed a biphasic assembly mechanism of the two P-clusters in the MoFe protein upon incubation with Fe protein and ATP, in which the first P-cluster is formed through fast fusion of a pair of [ Fe4S4]+clusters within 5 min and the second P-cluster is formed through slow fusion of the second pair of [ Fe4S4]+clusters in a period of 2 h. Here we report a VTVH MCD and EPR spectroscopic study of the biosynthesis of the slow-forming, second P-cluster within the MoFe protein. Our results show that the first major step in the formation of the second P-cluster is the conversion of one of the precursor [ Fe4S4]+clusters into the integer spin cluster [ Fe4S3-4]?, a process aided by the assembly protein NifZ, whereas the second major biosynthetic step appears to be the formation of a diamagnetic cluster with a possible structure of [ Fe8S7-8]?, which is eventually converted into the P-cluster."
"Allergic responses in humans, horses and other species are mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. Serum testing to detect allergen-specific IgE antibodies has been developed for dogs, cats and horses; this allows for the identification of allergens and determination of appropriate allergen- specific immunotherapies. This study compared serum allergen-specific IgE concentrations in atopic and healthy horses. The study was performed on Malopolski breed atopic (n=21) and nonatopic (n=21) clinically healthy horses. Allergen-specific IgE serum concentrations were measured in summer seasons of 2008-2015 using a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody. A Northern and Central European allergen panel containing mite, insect, mould and plant pollen allergens, including 15 tests of individual allergens and 5 tests of allergen mixtures was used. The mean allergen-specific IgE concentrations in the atopic and normal horse populations were compared. Among the atopic horses, the strongest positive reactions occurred against the storage mites Tyrophagus putrescentiae and the domestic mite Dermatophagoides farinae. The atopic horses also demonstrated high IgE concentrations against insects, particularly Tabanus sp., the plant pollens colza, cultivated rye and the mould pollen mixture Aspergillus/Penicillium. No horses in the atopic group were IgE-negative. Among all mite, insect, mould and some plant allergen groups the differences in mean specific IgE concentrations between allergic and healthy horses were significant. The mean IgE concentrations for most allergen groups were significantly higher in the atopic horses than in the healthy animals. However, a high incidence of positive reactions was observed in both healthy and allergic horses. Our results showed a high frequency of polysensitization in atopic horses."
"Antibacterial activity is the most widely studied aspect of plant extracts. Antibiotics extensively produced and consumed in large quantities, have proved to be problematic due to various types of adverse effects. The development of bacterial resistance to currently available antibiotics has necessitated the search for new antibacterial agents. One of the alternative strategies for fighting antibiotic- resistant bacteria is the use of natural antimicrobial substances such as plant extracts. We tested the antimicrobial activity of nine extracts from different plants against pathogenic bacteria isolated from the faeces of red deer (Cervus elaphus). Selected bacteria commonly contaminated the natural environment and constitute a source of infection in other animals and humans. Extracts obtained from the following plants were tested: Hypericum perforatum L., Chamomilla recutita L., Achillea millefolium L., Salvia officinalis L., Thymus vulgaris L., Pinus sylvestris L., Mentha x piperita L., Valeriana officinalis L. and Foeniculum vulgare Mill. The highest degree of antibacterial properties was observed for Mentha x piperita L., narrower spectrum of activity possessed Hypericum perforatum L. Extracts of Achillea millefolium L. had the lowest spectrum of antibacterial activity. Our study confirms that many plant extracts shows in vitro antibacterial activity."
"The aim of this study was to establish the immunophenotypic profile and karyotypic stability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of rabbits at the early passages in vitro following the application of different methods of dissociation of cellular material. MSCs were obtained from the femur bone marrow of three clinically healthy rabbits under general anaesthesia. Bone marrow aspirate was seeded in Petri dishes and cultured in a CO2 incubator with 5% CO2 at 37.0oC using a standard procedure. Immunohistochemical detection of nuclear proteins, cytoskeletal proteins and cell adhesion were performed by immunohistochemical analysis and karyotype analysis of MSCs following the enzyme and chelating methods of dissociation of the cell monolayer. The results of the immunophenotypic analysis of rabbit bone marrow MSCs showed that at the first, seventh, twelfth, and eighteenth passages these cells express markers of mesenchymal, muscle, epithelial and nerve cells. The choice of the enzyme or chelating method of dissociation of a culture of rabbit mesenchymal stem cells affects their cytogenetic variability. Dissociation of the MSCs monolayer with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid produces a cell culture with fewer quantitative and qualitative changes in the chromosome apparatus as compared to the enzyme method. Rabbit MSCs express markers of mesenchymal (vimentin, actin), muscle, epithelial and nerve (E-cadherin, N-cadherin) cells that are essential for differentiation of these cells. The chelating method of dissociation of a culture of rabbit mesenchymal stem cells, using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid during cultivation, is more advantageous than the enzyme method of dissociation because it leads to less cytogenetic variability."
"The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling (IIS) pathway is a pivotal genetic program regulating cell growth, tissue development, metabolic physiology, and longevity of multicellular organisms. IIS integrates a fine-tuned cascade of signaling events induced by insulin/IGF-1, which is precisely controlled by post-translational modifications. The ubiquitin/proteasome-system (UPS) influences the functionality of IIS through inducible ubiquitylation pathways that regulate internalization of the insulin/IGF-1 receptor, the stability of downstream insulin/IGF-1 signaling targets, and activity of nuclear receptors for control of gene expression. An age-related decline in UPS activity is often associated with an impairment of IIS, contributing to pathologies such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent findings identified a key role of diverse ubiquitin modifications in insulin signaling decisions, which governs dynamic adaption upon environmental and physiological changes. In this review, we discuss the mutual crosstalk between ubiquitin and insulin signaling pathways in the context of cellular and organismal homeostasis."
"Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a type B trichothecene, produced by the Fusarium species. Exposure to DON might cause disruptive effects such as reduced weight gain, neuroendocrine changes and immune modulation in animals (rats, dogs, pigs). There is huge concern that similar effects can be observed in humans. DON is a potential regulator of intracellular steroidogenesis. It is also possible that DON will be involved in the regulation of miRNAs connected with steroidogenesis. This review summarizes the latest knowledge about the influence of DON on steroidogenesis and human hormonal balance."
"DNA metallization has witnessed tremendous growth and development, from the initial simple synthesis aimed at manufacturing conductive metal nanowires to the current fabrication of various nanostructures for applications in areas as diverse as nanolithography, energy conversion and storage, catalysis, sensing, and biomedical engineering. To this, our aim here was to present a comprehensive review to summarize the research activities on DNA metallization that have appeared since the concept was first proposed in 1998. We start with a brief presentation of the basic knowledge of DNA and its unique advantages in the template-directed growth of metal nanomaterials, followed by providing a systematic summary of the various synthetic methods developed to date to deposit metals on DNA scaffolds. Then, the leverage of DNAs with different sequences, conformations, and structures for tuning the synthesis of feature-rich metal nanostructures is discussed. Afterwards, the discussion is divided around the applications of these metal nanomaterials in the fields mentioned above, wherein the key role DNA metallization plays in enabling high performance is emphasized. Finally, the current status and some future prospects and challenges in this field are summarized. As such, this review would be of great interest to promote the further development of DNA metallization by attracting researchers from various communities, including chemistry, biology, physiology, material science, and nanotechnology as well as other disciplines."
"Axial modified phthalocyanine (BtPc), aiming at avoiding H-aggregation and utilizing long wavelength light, was designed and synthesized. With the aid of polymer nanotechnology, BtPc loaded polymeric micelles with strong singlet oxygen generating ability and enhanced photodynamic therapy efficiency were developed. Optical characterizations and in vitro evaluations proved that the BtPc loaded polymeric micelles hold great potential for photodynamic therapy."
"The accumulation of protein aggregates in neurons is a typical pathological hallmark of the motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In many cases, these aggregates are composed of the 43 kDa TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP 43). Using a yeast model for TDP 43 proteinopathies, we observed that the vacuole (the yeast equivalent of lysosomes) markedly contributed to the degradation of TDP 43. This clearance occurred via TDP 43-containing vesicles fusing with the vacuole through the concerted action of the endosomal-vacuolar (or endolysosomal) pathway and autophagy. In line with its dominant role in the clearance of TDP 43, endosomal-vacuolar pathway activity protected cells from the detrimental effects of TDP 43. In contrast, enhanced autophagy contributed to TDP 43 cytotoxicity, despite being involved in TDP 43 degradation. TDP 43's interference with endosomal-vacuolar pathway activity may have two deleterious consequences. First, it interferes with its own degradation via this pathway, resulting in TDP 43 accumulation. Second, it affects vacuolar proteolytic activity, which requires endosomal-vacuolar trafficking. We speculate that the latter contributes to aberrant autophagy. In sum, we propose that ameliorating endolysosomal pathway activity enhances cell survival in TDP 43-associated diseases."
"Connectivity is a central concept in contemporary geographies of nature, but the concept is often understood and utilised in plural ways. This is problematic because of the separation, rather than the confusion, of these different approaches. While the various understandings of connectivity are rarely considered as working together, the connections between them have significant implications. This paper thus proposes re-thinking connectivity as a ""multiple"". It develops a taxonomy of existing connectivity concepts from the fields of biogeography and landscape ecology, conservation biology, socio-economic systems theory, political ecology and more-than-human geography. It then considers how these various understandings might be re-thought not as separate concerns, but (following Annemarie Mol) as ""more than one, but less than many"". The implications of using the connectivity multiple as an analytic for understanding conservation practices are demonstrated through considering the creation of wildlife corridors in conservation practice. The multiple does not just serve to highlight the practical and theoretical linkages between ecological theories, social inequities and affectual relationships in more-than-human worlds. It is also suggestive of a normative approach to environmental management that does not give temporal priority to biological theories, but considers these as always already situated in these social, often unequal, always more-than-human ecologies."
"This study investigates the therapeutic effect of a nanocurcumin formulation (NCF) containing nanocurcumin (NC) and pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) on ameliorating hypoxia-induced stress in hypertrophied primary human ventricular cardiomyocytes (HVCM) under hypoxic conditions, as validated in a Sprague-Dawley rat model of chronic hypobaric hypoxia (cHH)-induced right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). Based on our previous findings, here, we analyzed the improvement in the protective efficacy of NCF against mitochondrial damage. The electron transport chain Complexes' activities were analyzed as a chief operational center for mitochondrial homeostasis, along with key gene and protein markers for mitochondrial biogenesis, redox function, fatty acid oxidation, bio-energetic deficit and cell survival. NCF supplementation imparts cyto-protection from hypoxia-induced hypertrophy and damage in both in vitro and in vivo models while maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis better than NC and PQQ alone. This study proposes the use of NCF as a potential candidate molecule for imparting protection from high altitude-induced maladies in ascendants."
"Decoding how tissue properties emerge across multiple spatial and temporal scales from the integration of local signals is a grand challenge in quantitative biology. For example, the collective behavior of epithelial cells is critical for shaping developing embryos. Understanding how epithelial cells interpret a diverse range of local signals to coordinate tissue-level processes requires a systems-level understanding of development. Integration of multiple signaling pathways that specify cell signaling information requires second messengers such as calcium ions. Increasingly, specific roles have been uncovered for calcium signaling throughout development. Calcium signaling regulates many processes including division, migration, death, and differentiation. However, the pleiotropic and ubiquitous nature of calcium signaling implies that many additional functions remain to be discovered. Here we review a selection of recent studies to highlight important insights into how multiple signals are transduced by calcium transients in developing epithelial tissues. Quantitative imaging and computational modeling have provided important insights into how calcium signaling integration occurs. Reverse-engineering the conserved features of signal integration mediated by calcium signaling will enable novel approaches in regenerative medicine and synthetic control of morphogenesis."
"Three species of nematodes from the Camallanidae that are known to infect Xenopus laevis Daudin (Anura: Pipidae) were collected from several localities across South Africa. New data on morphology, partial 28S and cox1 genes, infection levels and distribution are presented herein. The most common species, Batrachocamallanus slomei Southwell et Kirshner, 1937, from the stomach and less often oesophagus, was found in eight localities. Camallanus kaapstaadi Southwell et Kirshner, 1937, also from the oesophagus, was found in two localities and C. xenopodis Jackson et Tinsley, 1995, from the intestine, at a single locality. New localities for both C. kaapstaadi and C. xenopodis provide a geographical range extension. Males of C. xenopodis are described for the first time herein. The existence of a left spicule in the males of both the species of Camallanus Railliet and Henry, 1915 is confirmed and measurements are provided. Although C. xenopodis is distinguished from C. mazabukae Kung, 1948 in the present study, we suggest greater sampling effort in other African amphibians to confirm the species status of the latter taxon. Finally, the new molecular data showed distant relationships between collected species of Camallanus and species parasitising fish and freshwater turtles."
"To evaluate the predictive value of time to sputum culture conversion (SCC) in predicting cure and factors associated with time to SCC and cure in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients, a retrospective study was conducted at programmatic management unit of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB), Peshawar. A total of 428 pulmonary MDR-TB patients enrolled at the study site from January 1, 2012 to August 31, 2014 were followed until treatment outcome was recorded. Survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards model and multivariate binary logistic regression were, respectively, used to identify factors associated with time to SCC and cure. APvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Overall, 90.9% patients achieved SCC, and 76.9% were cured. Previous use of second-line drugs (SLDs) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.637; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.429-0.947), ofloxacin resistance (HR = 0.656; 95% CI = 0.522-0.825) and lung cavitation (HR = 0.744; 95% CI = 0.595-0.931) were significantly associated with time to SCC. In predicting cure, sensitivities of SCC at 2, 4, and 6 months were 64.1% (95% CI = 58.69-69.32), 93.0% (95% CI = 89.69-95.52), and 97.6% (95% CI = 95.27-98.94), respectively, whereas specificities were 67.7% (95% CI = 57.53-76.73), 51.5% (95% CI = 41.25-61.68), and 44.4% (95% CI = 34.45-54.78), respectively. Furthermore, patients' age of 41-60 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.202; 95% CI = 0.067-0.605) and > 60 years (OR = 0.051; 95% CI = 0.011-0.224), body weight > 40 kg (OR = 2.950; 95% CI = 1.462-5.952), previous SLD use (OR = 0.270; 95% CI = 0.097-0.789), lung cavitation (OR = 0.196; 95% CI = 0.103-0.371) and ofloxacin resistance (OR = 0.386; 95% CI = 0.198-0.749) were significantly associated with cure. Association of SCC with cure was substantially stronger at 6 months (OR = 32.10; 95% CI = 14.34-71.85) than at 4 months (OR = 14.13; 95% CI = 7.92-25.21). However in predicting treatment outcomes, the combined sensitivity and specificity of SCC at 4 months was comparable to SCC at 6 months. Patients with risk factors for delayed SCC were also at high risk of unsuccessful outcomes."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, neurodegenerative pathology showing, among others, high cholinergic and neurotransmitter deficits, oxidative stress, inflammation, A?-aggregation resulting in senile plaques formation, and hyperphosphorylation of tau-protein leading to neurofibrillary tangles. Due to its multifactorial and complex nature, multitarget directed small-molecules able to simultaneously inhibit or bind diverse biological targets involved in the progress and development of AD are considered now the best therapeutic strategy to design new compounds for AD therapy. Among them, tacrine is a very well known standard-gold ligand, and natural products have been a traditional source of new agents for diverse therapeutic treatments. In this review we will update recent developments of multitarget tacrine-natural products hybrids for AD therapy."
"Lysosomes may have an important role in response to ionizing radiation. Moreover, radiation could affect autophagy, which process involves the activity of lysosomal enzymes. In the present study, the effect of ionizing radiation on the lysosomal compartment of mouse liver was investigated after in vivo exposure.Morphology and ultrastructure of hepatocytes were assessed by light and electron microscopy, and activities of selected lysosomal enzymes were assessed in 12, 36 and 120?h after exposure to the mean dose of 1?Gy. The levels of autophagy-related proteins LC3-II and p62 were compared by Western blotting between untreated and irradiated animals (120?h after exposure).Increased number of autophagic vacuoles in hepatocytes from exposed animals was documented in the ultrastructural study; destroyed mitochondria were the dominant component of such vacuoles. Moreover, an increased activity of lysosomal hydrolases was observed after exposure. However, levels of autophagy substrates LC3-II and p62 were barely affected in exposed animals 120?h after irradiation when the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles was observed.Effects of irradiation included an increased number of autophagic vacuoles, especially of autophagosomes, and increased activity of lysosomal enzymes. However, putative markers of autophagic flux were not observed, which suggested suppression of the completion of the radiation-mediated autophagy pathway."
"Simple cyclophanes containing four distant amino N atoms or ether O atoms behave as hosts for the threading of guest diarylguanidinium ions. The recognition system exhibits high synthetic flexibility, allowing unique O-free [2]rotaxanes to be synthesized efficiently (yields of up to 80%) through both ""threading-followed-by-stoppering"" and ""clipping"" approaches."
"Adipose tissue (AT) expands via both hypertrophy and hyperplasia during the development of obesity. While AT hypertrophy involves the increase in size of existing adipocytes, hyperplasia is the process of creating new adipocytes from the pool of adipocyte precursor cells (APCs), which includes adipocyte progenitor cells and preadipocytes. Prior studies have implicated a role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in regulation of hyperplasia in white adipose tissue (WAT). Here, we aimed to determine the mechanisms underlying SNS regulation of APC proliferation in mouse WAT. Using flow cytometry with antibodies against various cell surface markers, along with an intracellular marker of proliferation (Ki67), we quantitated the percentages and proliferative status of adipocyte progenitor cells and preadipocytes in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of WAT. In vivo SNS activation through cold exposure, as well as in vitro adrenergic stimulation via exposure to the canonical SNS neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE), inhibited preadipocyte proliferation. Pretreatment with propranolol, a ?1- and ?2-adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonist, trended toward rescuing the inhibitory effects of NE in primary cell culture. The selective ?1-AR agonist dobutamine diminished preadipocyte proliferation both in vivo and in vitro, whereas the selective ?2-AR agonist, salbutamol, promoted proliferation in vitro, suggesting that the ?1-AR may mediate the inhibitory effect of NE on preadipocyte proliferation. Taken together, we conclude that SNS activation suppresses preadipocyte proliferation via activation of the ?1 AR in WAT."
"Comorbid personality disorder (PD) worsens outcome in mental state disorders; however, the proportion of people with PD who have an alcohol use disorder (AUD) is poorly described. A systematic review of the literature for studies reporting on AUD in those with PD was completed. Lifetime prevalence figures were meta-analysed using multilevel models, accounting for type of PD and population examined. Sixteen unique studies contributed data to the analysis. PD type accounted for most of the heterogeneity in lifetime AUD prevalence. People with antisocial PD had the highest lifetime AUD prevalence, at 76.7%, followed by those with borderline PD at 52.2%, while those with other forms of PD, or undifferentiated PD, had a prevalence of 38.9%. Lifetime AUD prevalence was not significantly higher in clinical compared with population samples. The majority of people with PD experience an AUD at some time in the life course. This has clinical screening and management implications. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Cellular reprogramming, the process by which somatic cells regain pluripotency, is relevant in many disease modeling, therapeutic, and drug discovery applications. Molecular evaluation of reprogramming (e.g., polymerase chain reaction, immunostaining) is typically disruptive, and only provides snapshots of phenotypic traits. Gene reporter constructs facilitate live-cell evaluation but is labor intensive and may risk insertional mutagenesis during viral transfection. Herein, the utilization of a non-integrative nanosensor is demonstrated to visualize key reprogramming events in situ within live cells. Principally based on sustained intracellular release of encapsulated molecular probes, nanosensors successfully monitored mesenchymal-epithelial transition, pluripotency acquisition, and transdifferentiation events. Tracking the dynamic expression of four pivotal biomarkers (i.e., THY1, E-CADHERIN, OCT4, and GATA4 mRNA), nanosensor signal showed great agreement with polymerase chain reaction and gene reporter imaging (R2> 0.9). Overall, such facile, versatile nanosensor enables real-time monitoring of low-frequency reprogramming events, thereby useful for high-throughput assessment, optimization, and biomarker-specific cell enrichment."
"Avulsed teeth should be immediately replanted into the socket or otherwise kept in a physiologic storage medium to maintain periodontal ligament cell viability. A previous study has demonstrated that Thai propolis extract can maintain viability of human periodontal ligament cells. However, root resorption by osteoclasts often occurs when the avulsed teeth are replanted. The aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effect of Thai propolis extract on human osteoclastogenesis in vitro.Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated for osteoclast precursors and cultured in the presence or absence of various non-toxic concentrations of propolis extract, as determined by the alamarBlue®assay, during in vitro induction of osteoclastogenesis. Osteoclast formation was examined by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, actin ring formation, and real time polymerase chain reaction. The resorption pit assay was performed to determine osteoclast function.Non-toxic concentrations of propolis extract suppressed osteoclast formation by significantly decreasing the percentages of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinuclear cells and the ratios of cells with F-actin ring formation (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent fashion. Expression of several osteoclast-specific genes was significantly down-regulated by propolis in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). The percentages of resorption areas on dentin slices were significantly decreased by propolis (P < 0.05).Thai propolis can inhibit human osteoclast formation and function, which may be beneficial for prevention of root resorption following replantation of avulsed teeth.

"The exploration of 2D solids is one of our time's generators of materials discoveries. A recent addition to the 2D world is MXenes that possses a rich chemistry due to the large parent family of MAX phases. Recently, a new type of atomic laminated phases (coined i-MAX) is reported, in which two different transition metal atoms are ordered in the basal planes. Herein, these i-MAX phases are used in a new route for tailoriong the MXene structure and composition. By employing different etching protocols to the parent i-MAX phase (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlC, the resulting MXene can be either: i) (Mo2/3Y1/3)2C with in-plane elemental order through selective removal of Al atoms or ii) Mo1.33C with ordered vacancies through selective removal of both Al and Y atoms. When (Mo2/3Y1/3)2C (ideal stoichiometry) is used as an electrode in a supercapacitor-with KOH electrolyte-a volumetric capacitance exceeding 1500 F cm-3is obtained, which is 40% higher than that of its Mo1.33C counterpart. With H2SO4, the trend is reversed, with the latter exhibiting the higher capacitance (?1200 F cm-3). This additional ability for structural tailoring will indubitably prove to be a powerful tool in property-tailoring of 2D materials, as exemplified here for supercapacitors."
"Food webs and meso-scale motifs allow us to understand the structure of ecological communities and define species' roles within them. This species-level perspective on networks permits tests for relationships between species' traits and their patterns of direct and indirect interactions. Such relationships could allow us to predict food-web structure based on more easily obtained trait information. Here, we calculated the roles of species (as vectors of motif position frequencies) in six well-resolved marine food webs and identified the motif positions associated with the greatest variation in species' roles. We then tested whether the frequencies of these positions varied with species' traits. Despite the coarse-grained traits we used, our approach identified several strong associations between traits and motifs. Feeding environment was a key trait in our models and may shape species' roles by affecting encounter probabilities. Incorporating environment into future food-web models may improve predictions of an unknown network structure."
"Understanding how humans and other animals behave in response to changes in their environments is vital for predicting population dynamics and the trajectory of coupled social-ecological systems. Here, we present a novel framework for identifying emergent social behaviours in foragers (including humans engaged in fishing or hunting) in predator-prey contexts based on the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of a renewable natural resource. A qualitative framework is introduced that predicts when foragers should behave territorially, search collectively, act independently or switch among these states. To validate it, we derived quantitative predictions from two models of different structure: a generic mathematical model, and a lattice-based evolutionary model emphasising exploitation and exclusion costs. These models independently identified that the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of the natural resource controls the social behaviour of resource exploiters. Our theoretical predictions were finally compared to a diverse set of empirical cases focusing on fisheries and aquatic organisms across a range of taxa, substantiating the framework's predictions. Understanding social behaviour for given social-ecological characteristics has important implications, particularly for the design of governance structures and regulations to move exploited systems, such as fisheries, towards sustainability. Our framework provides concrete steps in this direction."
"We respond to seven criticisms made by Vermeij et al. () regarding Miller & Wiens (). Their criticisms generally reflect misunderstandings, unsupported speculations, and topics that were explicitly addressed in our paper."
"The allocation of metabolic energy to growth fundamentally influences all levels of biological organisation. Here we use a first-principles theoretical model to characterise the energetics of fish growth at distinct ontogenetic stages and in distinct thermal regimes. Empirically, we show that the mass scaling of growth rates follows that of metabolic rate, and is somewhat steeper at earlier ontogenetic stages. We also demonstrate that the cost of growth, Em, varies substantially among fishes, and that it may increase with temperature, trophic level and level of activity. Theoretically, we show that Emis a primary determinant of the efficiency of energy transfer across trophic levels, and that energy is transferred more efficiently between trophic levels if the prey are young and sedentary. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of characterising the energetics of individual growth in order to understand constraints on the structure of food webs and ecosystems."
"Miller & Wiens (2017) claim that low marine as compared with terrestrial diversity results from more frequent extinctions and insufficient time for diversification in marine clades. Their data on marine amniotes are unrepresentative of marine diversity, their analysis of clade dynamics is flawed, and they ignore previously proposed explanations for the diversity difference."
"The controlled functionalization of surfaces with proteins is crucial for many analytical methods in life science research and biomedical applications. Here, a coating for silica-based surfaces is established which enables stable and selective immobilization of proteins with controlled orientation and tunable surface density. The coating is reusable, retains functionality upon long-term storage in air, and is applicable to surfaces of complex geometry. The protein anchoring method is validated on planar surfaces, and then a method is developed to measure the anchoring process in real time using silicon nitride solid-state nanopores. For surface attachment, polyhistidine tags that are site specifically introduced into recombinant proteins are exploited, and the yeast nucleoporin Nsp1 is used as model protein. Contrary to the commonly used covalent thiol chemistry, the anchoring of proteins via polyhistidine tag is reversible, permitting to take proteins off and replace them by other ones. Such switching in real time in experiments on individual nanopores is monitored using ion conductivity. Finally, it is demonstrated that silica and gold surfaces can be orthogonally functionalized to accommodate polyhistidine-tagged proteins on silica but prevent protein binding to gold, which extends the applicability of this surface functionalization method to even more complex sensor devices."
"To compare the clinical and microbiological performance of minimally and moderately rough implants in patients with a history of severe periodontitis.Forty-eight minimally (Tur) and moderately (TiU) rough implants were placed in eighteen patients according to a split-mouth protocol. Marginal bone loss, probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing (BoP) were recorded, and microbial samples were analysed by means of quantitative PCR.The amount of bone loss over the 5 year period tended to be lower along Tur when compared to TiU surfaces (1.0 vs.1.7 mm, p=0.06). Although the clinical outcomes tended to be better for Tur surfaces, there were no significant differences between both surfaces in mean PPD (Tur: 3.1 vs. TiU: 4.2 mm, p=0.09) or CAL (Tur: 0.5 vs. TiU: 1.7 mm, p=0.06). More bone loss and deeper pockets were recorded for partially than for fully edentulous patients. The cumulative survival rate at 5-year follow-up was 95.8% for Tur, and 100% for TiU surface implants. No significant differences were found between the surfaces in counts for key-pathogens.In patients with a history of severe periodontitis minimally rough implants showed more favourable clinical parameters after 5 years of loading, when compared to moderately rough implants.

"Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) significantly influences plant growth, development and biomass. Increased photosynthesis rate, together with lower stomatal conductance, have been identified as the key factors that stimulate plant growth at elevated [CO2] (e[CO2]). However, variations in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance alone cannot fully explain the dynamic changes in plant growth. Stimulation of photosynthesis at e[CO2] is always associated with post-photosynthetic secondary metabolic processes that include carbon and nitrogen metabolism, cell cycle functions and hormonal regulation. Most studies have focused on photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in response to e[CO2], despite the emerging evidence of e[CO2]'s role in moderating secondary metabolism in plants. In this review, we briefly discuss the effects of e[CO2] on photosynthesis and stomatal conductance and then focus on the changes in other cellular mechanisms and growth processes at e[CO2] in relation to plant growth and development. Finally, knowledge gaps in understanding plant growth responses to e[CO2] have been identified with the aim of improving crop productivity under a CO2rich atmosphere."
"Many organisms - notably microbes - are embedded within complex communities where cooperative behaviours in the form of excreted public goods can benefit other species. Under such circumstances, intraspecific interactions are likely to be less important in driving the evolution of cooperation. We first illustrate this idea with a simple theoretical model, showing that relatedness - the extent to which individuals with the same cooperative alleles interact with each other - has a reduced impact on the evolution of cooperation when public goods are shared between species. We test this empirically using strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that vary in their production of metal-chelating siderophores in copper contaminated compost (an interspecific public good). We show that non-siderophore producers grow poorly relative to producers under high relatedness, but this cost can be alleviated by the presence of the isogenic producer (low relatedness) and/or the compost microbial community. Hence, relatedness can become unimportant when public goods provide interspecific benefits. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
"An estimated 3% of US pregnancies are affected by maternal thyroid dysfunction, with between one and three of every 1000 pregnancies being complicated by overactive maternal thyroid levels. Excess thyroid hormones are linked to neurological impairment and excessive craniofacial variation, affecting both endochondral and intramembranous bone. Using a geometric morphometric approach, this study evaluates the role of in utero thyroxine overexposure on the growth of offspring mandibles in a sample of 241 mice. Canonical variate analysis utilized 16 unilateral mandibular landmarks obtained from 3D micro-computed tomography to assess shape changes between unexposed controls (n?=?63) and exposed mice (n?=?178). By evaluating shape changes in the mandible among three age groups (15, 20 and 25?days postnatal) and different dosage levels (low, medium and high), this study found that excess maternal thyroxine alters offspring mandibular shape in both age- and dosage-dependent manners. Group differences in overall shape were significant (P?<?0.001), and showed major changes in regions of the mandible associated with muscle attachment (coronoid process, gonial angle) and regions of growth largely governed by articulation with the cranial base (condyle) and occlusion (alveolus). These results compliment recent studies demonstrating that maternal thyroxine levels can alter the cranial base and cranial vault of offspring, contributing to a better understanding of both normal and abnormal mandibular development, as well as the medical implications of craniofacial growth and development."
"Highly bioactive compounds of the snake venom make them particular sources for anticancer agent development. They contain very rich peptide-protein structures. Therefore, they are very susceptible to environmental conditions such as temperature, pH, and light. In this study, Vipera ammodytes transcaucasiana venom was encapsulated in PAMAM-G4 dendrimer by sol-gel method in order to prevent degradation of venom contents from the environmental conditions. For this purpose, nanoparticles were prepared by sol-gel methodology and SEM analyses were performed. U87MG and SHSY5Y neuronal cancer cell lines were treated with different concentrations of venom-containing nanoparticles and cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay. IC50values of nanoparticles with snake venom were calculated as 37.24 and 44.64 ?g/ml for U87MG and SHSY5Y cells, respectively. The IC50values of nanoparticles with snake venom were calculated as 10.07 and 7.9 ?g/ml for U87MG and SHSY5Y cells, respectively. As a result, nanoparticles with V. a. transcaucasiana venom showed remarkably high cytotoxicity. Encapsulation efficiency of nanoparticles with 1 mg/ml snake venom was determined as %67 via BCA protein analysis. In conclusion, this method is found to be convenient and useful for encapsulating snake venom as well as being suitable for drug delivery systems."
"Salinity is one of the major threats faced by the modern agriculture today. It causes multidimensional effects on plants. These effects depend upon the plant growth stage, intensity, and duration of the stress. All these lead to stunted growth and reduced yield, ultimately inducing economic loss to the farming community in particular and to the country in general. The soil conditions of agricultural land are deteriorating at an alarming rate. Plants assess the stress conditions, transmit the specific stress signals, and then initiate the response against that stress. A more complete understanding of plant response mechanisms and their practical incorporation in crop improvement is an essential step towards achieving the goal of sustainable agricultural development. Literature survey shows that investigations of plant stresses response mechanism are the focus area of research for plant scientists. Although these efforts lead to reveal different plant response mechanisms against salt stress, yet many questions still need to be answered to get a clear picture of plant strategy to cope with salt stress. Moreover, these studies have indicated the presence of a complicated network of different integrated pathways. In order to work in a progressive way, a review of current knowledge is critical. Therefore, this review aims to provide an overview of our understanding of plant response to salt stress and to indicate some important yet unexplored dynamics to improve our knowledge that could ultimately lead towards crop improvement."
"Chronic inflammation plays an essential role in the development of diabetic complications. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that support inflammation is a prerequisite for the design of novel anti-inflammatory therapies. These would take into consideration circulating levels of cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that include the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein which, in part, promotes the inflammatory response through TLR4 signaling. The liver, as the source of circulating cytokines and acute-phase proteins, contributes to the control of systemic inflammation. We previously found that liver injury in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats correlated with the level of oxidative stress, increased expression of HMGB1, and with the activation of TLR4-mediated cell death pathways. In the present work, we examined the effects of ethyl pyruvate (EP), an inhibitor of HMGB1 release/expression, on the modulation of activation of the HMGB1/TLR4 inflammatory cascade in diabetic liver. We observed that increased expression of inflammatory markers, TNF-?, IL-6, and haptoglobin in diabetic liver was associated with increased HMGB1/TLR4 interaction, activation of MAPK (p38, ERK, JNK)/NF-?B p65 and JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathways, and with decreased expression of Nrf2-regulated antioxidative enzymes. The reduction in HMGB1 expression as the result of EP administration reduced the pro-inflammatory activity of HMGB1 and exerted a protective effect on diabetic liver, which was observed as improved liver histology and antioxidant and inflammatory statuses. Our results suggest that prevention of HMGB1 release and blockage of the HMGB/TLR4 axis represents a potentially effective therapeutic strategy aimed at ameliorating diabetes-induced inflammation and ensuing liver injury."
"Lysosomes are degradation and signaling centers within the cell, and their dysfunction impairs a wide variety of cellular processes. To understand the cellular effect of lysosome damage, we screened natural small-molecule compounds that induce lysosomal abnormality using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as a model system. A group of vobasinyl-ibogan type bisindole alkaloids (ervachinines A-D) were identified that caused lysosome enlargement in C. elegans macrophage-like cells. Intriguingly, these compounds triggered cell death in the germ line independently of the canonical apoptosis pathway. In mammalian cells, ervachinines A-D induced lysosomal enlargement and damage, leading to leakage of cathepsin proteases, inhibition of autophagosome degradation and necrotic cell death. Further analysis revealed that this ervachinine-induced lysosome damage and lysosomal cell death depended on STAT3 signaling, but not RIP1 or RIP3 signaling. These findings suggest that lysosome-damaging compounds are promising reagents for dissecting signaling mechanisms underlying lysosome homeostasis and lysosome-related human disorders."

"(Z)-4-undecenal (Z4-11Al) is the volatile pheromone produced by females of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. Female flies emit Z4-11Al for species-specific communication and mate-finding. A sensory panel finds that synthetic Z4-11Al has a characteristic flavour, which can be perceived even at the small amounts produced by a single female fly. Since only females produce Z4-11Al, and not males, we can reliably distinguish between single D. melanogaster males and females, according to their scent. Females release Z4-11Al at 2.4 ng/h and we readily sense 1 ng synthetic Z4-11Al in a glass of wine (0.03 nmol/L), while a tenfold concentration is perceived as a loud off-flavour. This corroborates the observation that a glass of wine is spoilt by a single D. melanogaster fly falling into it, which we here show is caused by Z4-11Al. The biological role of Z4-11Al or structurally related aldehydes in humans and the basis for this semiochemical convergence remains yet unclear."
"Isaria cateniannulata and Euseius nicholsi are two important biological control agents currently being used in many areas of China to control a variety of pests. In order to determine the possibility of a concomitant application with the two agents in a biocontrol program involving the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, we quantified the pathogenicity of a strain of I. cateniannulata (08XS-1) against females of both T. urticae and E. nicholsi. We observed the infection process using scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy to distinguish differences in fungal performance. The female mites were infected by I. cateniannulata at 2?×?107conidia/ml. The mortality of T. urticae was 100% when treated with submerged conidia and 92% when treated with aerial conidia (spray), and that of E. nicholsi was 4.2 and 6.7%, correspondingly. Following infection with aerial or submerged conidia, mated E. nicholsi females displayed no significant differences between treatments and control, indicating the fungus had no obvious effect on their vitality and fertility. This demonstrates that I. cateniannulata is safe to E. nicholsi when used to control T. urticae. The two types of propagules of I. cateniannulata are readily produced by common culture, and the submerged conidia, because of their substantially higher mortality, are preferable to the aerial conidia. Our results indicate that I. cateniannulata and E. nicholsi are viable candidates to be concomitantly applied in the biocontrol programs of T. urticae."
"Cancer is a pathology characterized by increased cell progression and/or reduced programmed cell death. Melanoma shows a rapid increase in cell progression and its resistance to chemotherapy is associated with uncontrolled apoptosis and to mechanisms that increase the flow of the drug out of the cell. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) on the cell proliferation and cellular alterations in B16F10 murine melanoma. For that, four experimental groups were evaluated: the control group; laser group (??=?660 ?m, 40 mW, 2.4 J/cm2); photosensitizer group (solution containing methylene blue and toluidine blue 1:1-12.5 ?g/mL); PDT group. The incubation time was 30 min. Fluorescence microscopy assays were performed without fixation with the DAPI, monodansylcadaverine (MDC), and dihydroethidium (DHE) probes. Cell proliferation was also determined at 24-h time. The tests were performed in triplicate and the statistical test used was ANOVA with Tukey post-test. The results demonstrate that the plasma membrane of the cells of all the experimental groups remained intact, ROS production and autophagy significantly increased (p?<?0.0005 and p?<?0.0071, respectively) only in the PDT group. The cell proliferation essay showed a reduction of 74.2% on the PDT group in relation to the control group. The present study demonstrated that oxidative stress promoted by photodynamic therapy may induce autophagy and consequently reduce cell proliferation in B16F10 melanoma."
"Acquired coagulation factor inhibitors are rare. Among them, coagulation factor V (FV) inhibitor is particularly uncommon and presents with variable clinical manifestations. Certain acquired FV inhibitor patients have only mild bleeding or, in select cases, no symptoms at all, leading to spontaneous recovery. Others have life-threatening bleeding that requires medical attention. Thus, a prompt decision regarding diagnosis and clinical intervention is crucial for such patients. In five acquired FV inhibitor cases treated in our facility, each patient had a malignancy as an underlying disease and all unexpectedly showed prolongation of both prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). They all also displayed a discrepancy between PT and Normotest (Hepaplastintest, HPT) results. All but one patient experienced no bleeding at the time of diagnosis and achieved spontaneous recovery in 1-3 weeks. The patient with bleeding symptoms received plasma exchanges and a platelet transfusion. Useful markers in diagnosing the presence of an acquired FV inhibitor were a sudden prolongation of PT and APTT, and a discrepancy between the PT/APTT and HPT assays. Spontaneous recovery can be expected for patients with only minor bleeding."
"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have become a promising tool for therapeutic intervention. Their unique features, including self-renewal, multipotency and immunomodulatory properties draw the worldwide attention of researchers and physicians with respect to their application in disease treatment. However, the environment (so-called niche) from which MSCs are isolated may determine their usefulness. Many studies indicated the involvement of MSCs in ageing and disease. In this review, we have focused on how type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome (MS) affect MSC properties, and thus limit their therapeutic potential. Herein, we mainly focus on apoptosis, autophagy and mitochondria deterioration processes that indirectly affect MSC fate. Based on the data presented, special attention should be paid when considering autologous MSC therapy in T2D or MS treatments, as their therapeutic potential may be restricted."
"The discovery and creation of biocatalysts for plant biomass conversion are essential for industrial demand and scientific research of the plant cell wall. ?-1,2 and ?-1,3-L-arabinofuranosidases are debranching enzymes that catalyzing hydrolytic release of ?-L-arabinofuranosyl residues in plant cell wall. Gene database analyses shows that GH62 family only contains specific ?-L-arabinofuranosidases that play an important role in the degradation and structure of the plant cell wall. At present, there are only 22 enzymes in this group has been characterized. In this study, we cloned a novel ?-1,3-arabinofuranosidase gene (poabf62a) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 62 from Penicillium oxalicum sp. 68 and expressed it in Pichia pastoris. The molecular mass of recombinant PoAbf62A was estimated to be 32.9 kDa. Using p-nitrophenyl-?-l-arabinofuranoside (pNP?Abf) as substrate, purified PoAbf62A exhibited an optimal pH of 4.5 and temperature of 35 °C. Results of methylation and13C NMR analyses showed that PoAbf62A was exclusively ?-1,3-arabinofuranosidase, specific for cleavage of ?-1,3-arabinofuranosyl residues, and with the absence of activity towards ?-1,2-arabinofuranose and ?-1,5-arabinofuranose. Therefore, PoAbf62A exhibits high activity on sugar beet arabinan and wheat arabinoxylan, because their branched side chain are decorated with ?-1,3-arabinofuranose. On the other hand, there is a lack of activity with linear-?-L-1,5-arabinan and xylan that only contained ?-L-1,5-arabinofuranose or ?-1,4-xylose. The ?-1,3-arabinofuranosidase activity identified here provides a new biocatalytic tool to degrade hemicellulose and analyze the structure of plant cell walls."
"While thinning of the cortices or trabeculae weakens bone, age-related changes in matrix composition also lower fracture resistance. This review summarizes how the organic matrix, mineral phase, and water compartments influence the mechanical behavior of bone, thereby identifying characteristics important to fracture risk.In the synthesis of the organic matrix, tropocollagen experiences various post-translational modifications that facilitate a highly organized fibril of collagen I with a preferred orientation giving bone extensibility and several toughening mechanisms. Being a ceramic, mineral is brittle but increases the strength of bone as its content within the organic matrix increases. With time, hydroxyapatite-like crystals experience carbonate substitutions, the consequence of which remains to be understood. Water participates in hydrogen bonding with organic matrix and in electrostatic attractions with mineral phase, thereby providing stability to collagen-mineral interface and ductility to bone. Clinical tools sensitive to age- and disease-related changes in matrix composition that the affect mechanical behavior of bone could potentially improve fracture risk assessment."
"?-Lapachone (?-Lap), morphine (Mor), and electromagnetic field (EMF) generate reactive oxygen species. The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of Mor and EMF, in combination with ?-Lap on the cell growth inhibition and expression of several antioxidant genes. The 0.50 mT intensity of 50 Hz EMF and two exposure conditions (""15 min field-on/15 min field-off"" and ""30 min field-on continuously"") on SH-SY5Y cells were used. The effects of Mor and EMF, in combination with ?-Lap on cell growth inhibition and the expression levels of several antioxidant genes (NQO1, NQO2, SOD1, SOD2, CAT, GSTO1, GSTM2, GSTM3, GSTP1, MGST1, MGST3) in SH-SY5Y cells were measured. The relative mRNA levels were calculated according to the [Formula: see text]. Whereas NQO1 mRNA level decreased in the ""15 min field-on/15 min field-off"" condition, the expression level of NQO2 was increased. Both NQO1 and NQO2 expressions increased in Mor treated cells. IC50values of ?-Lap in combination with Mor, EMF, and ""Mor?+?EMF"" were higher than cells treated only with ?-Lap. The NQO1 expression level in the cells treated with ?-Lap was higher than the other treatments, indicating that ?-Lap induces the expression of NQO1. Moreover, multiple linear regression analysis indicated that NQO1 mRNA levels were associated positively with ?-Lap and negatively with EMF. At least in part, the mRNA levels of NQO1 were associated with IC50values of ?-Lap in designed treatments. There is a negative association between mRNA levels of NQO1 and IC50values of ?-Lap but not NQO2."
"A modified genomic DNA extraction method named the combination of lysozyme and ultrasonic lysis (CLU) method was used to analyze the fish intestinal microflora. In this method, the physical disruption and chemical lysis steps were combined, and some parameters in the key steps were adjusted. In addition, the results obtained by this method were compared with the results obtained by the Zirmil-beating cell disruption method and the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit. The OD260/OD280ratio and concentration of the DNA extracted using the CLU method were 2.02 and 282.8 µg/µL, respectively; when the incubation temperatures for lysozyme and RNase were adjusted to 37 °C, those values were 2.08 and 309.8 µg/µL, respectively. On the agarose gel, a major high-intensity, discrete band of more than 10 kb was found for the CLU method. However, the smearing intensity of degraded DNA was lower when the incubation temperatures were 60 °C for lysozyme and 30 °C for RNase than when incubation temperatures of 37 °C for lysozyme and 37 °C for RNase were used. The V3 variable region of the prokaryotic 16S rDNA was amplified, and an approximately 600-bp fragment was observed when the DNA extracted using the CLU method was used as a template. The CLU method is simple and cost effective, and it yields high-quality, unsheared, high-molecular-weight DNA, which is comparable to that obtained with a commercially available kit. The extracted DNA has potential for applications in critical molecular biology techniques."
"Much research on large herbivore movement has focused on the annual scale to distinguish between resident and migratory tactics, commonly assuming that individuals are sedentary at the within-season scale. However, apparently sedentary animals may occupy a number of sub-seasonal functional home ranges (sfHR), particularly when the environment is spatially heterogeneous and/or temporally unpredictable. The roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) experiences sharply contrasting environmental conditions due to its widespread distribution, but appears markedly sedentary over much of its range. Using GPS monitoring from 15 populations across Europe, we evaluated the propensity of this large herbivore to be truly sedentary at the seasonal scale in relation to variation in environmental conditions. We studied movement using net square displacement to identify the possible use of sfHR. We expected that roe deer should be less sedentary within seasons in heterogeneous and unpredictable environments, while migratory individuals should be seasonally more sedentary than residents. Our analyses revealed that, across the 15 populations, all individuals adopted a multi-range tactic, occupying between two and nine sfHR during a given season. In addition, we showed that (i) the number of sfHR was only marginally influenced by variation in resource distribution, but decreased with increasing sfHR size; and (ii) the distance between sfHR increased with increasing heterogeneity and predictability in resource distribution, as well as with increasing sfHR size. We suggest that the multi-range tactic is likely widespread among large herbivores, allowing animals to track spatio-temporal variation in resource distribution and, thereby, to cope with changes in their local environment."
"Rituximab has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with B-cell lymphoma. However, patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) still have a poor prognosis, and the choice between high-dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and allogeneic HCT remains controversial in these patients. We retrospectively analyzed the risk factors for outcomes in 162 R/R MCL patients who received autologous (n?=?111) or allogeneic (n?=?51) HCT between 2004 and 2014. The median overall survival (OS) rates were 48 and 65 months in the autologous and allogeneic HCT groups, respectively (P?=?0.20). Significant risk factors for overall survival in R/R MCL patients after autologous HCT were >?60 years of age at HCT (P?=?0.017), higher score of HCT-specific comorbidity index at HCT (P?=?0.033), and receiving MCEC (ranimustine?+?carboplatin?+?etoposide?+?cyclophosphamide) regimen (P?=?0.017), while higher performance status at HCT (P?=?0.011) and longer interval from diagnosis to HCT (P?=?0.0054) were risk factors after allogeneic HCT. Strategies that carefully select R/R MCL patients for autologous HCT may allow the identification of individuals suitable for allogeneic HCT."
"Avibacterium paragallinarum is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes infectious coryza in chicken. It was reported that the capsule polysaccharides extracted from Av. paragallinarum genotype A contained chondroitin. Chondroitin synthase of Av. paragallinarum (ApCS) encoded by one gene within the presumed capsule biosynthesis gene cluster exhibited considerable homology to identified bacterial chondroitin synthases. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of ApCS. This enzyme indeed displays chondroitin synthase activity involved in the biosynthesis of the capsule. ApCS is a bifunctional protein catalyzing the elongation of the chondroitin chain by alternatively transferring the glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) residues from their nucleotide forms to the non-reducing ends of the saccharide chains. GlcA with a para-nitrophenyl group (pNP) could serve as the acceptor for ApCS; this enzyme shows a stringent donor tolerance when the acceptor is as small as this monosaccharide. Then, UDP-GalNAc and GlcA-pNP were injected sequentially through the chip-immobilized chondroitin synthases, and the surface plasmon resonance data demonstrated that the up-regulated extent caused by the binding of the donor is one possibly essential factor in successful polymerization reaction. This conclusion will, therefore, enhance the understanding of the mode of action of glycosyltransferase. Surprisingly, high activity at near-zero temperature as well as weak temperature dependence of this novel bacterial chondroitin synthase indicate that ApCS was a cold-active enzyme. From all accounts, ApCS becomes the fourth known bacterial chondroitin synthase, and the potential applications in artificial chondroitin sulfate and glycosaminoglycan synthetic approaches make it an attractive glycosyltransferase for further investigation."
"Boxwood blight is an emerging disease of ornamental and native boxwood plants in the family Buxaceae. First documented in the 1990s at a single location in England, the disease is now reported throughout Europe, Asia, New Zealand, and North America. To address the growing concern over boxwood blight, ongoing research focuses on multiple biological and genetic aspects of the causal pathogens and susceptible host plants. Characterization of genetic variation among the Calonectria fungi that cause boxwood blight shows that two unique sister species with different geographic distributions incite the disease. Studies of the pathogen life cycle show the formation of long-lived survival structures and that host infection is dependent on inoculum density, temperature, and humidity. Host range investigations detail high levels of susceptibility among boxwood as well as the potential for asymptomatic boxwood infection and for other plants in the family Buxaceae to serve as additional hosts. Multiple DNA-based diagnostic assays are available, ranging from probe-based quantitative PCR assays to the use of comparative genomics to develop robust diagnostic markers or provide whole genome-scale identifications. Though many questions remain, the research that continues to address boxwood blight demonstrates the importance of applying a multidisciplinary approach to understand and control emerging plant diseases."
"Anaerobic technology has a wide scope of application in different areas such as manufacturing, food industry, and agriculture. Nowadays, it is mainly used to produce electrical and thermal energy from crop processing, solid waste treatment or wastewater treatment. More intensively, trend nowadays is usage of this technology biodegradable and biomass waste processing and biomethane or hydrogen production. In this paper, the diversities of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) under different imputed raw material to the bioreactors were characterized. These diversities at the beginning of sampling and after cultivation were compared. Desulfovibrio, Desulfobulbus, and Desulfomicrobium genus as dominant among sulfate reducers in the bioreactors were detected. The Desulfobulbus species were dominant among other SRB genera before cultivation, but these bacteria were detected only in three out of the seven bioreactors after cultivation dominant."
"The lymphatic vasculature act as the drainage system for most of our tissues and organs, clearing interstitial fluid and waste and returning them to the blood circulation. This is not the case for the central nervous system (CNS), which is devoid of parenchymal lymphatic vessels. Nevertheless, the brain is responsible for 25% of the body's metabolism and only compromises 2% of the body's mass. This high metabolic load requires an efficient system to remove waste products and maintain homeostasis. Well-described mechanisms of waste clearance include phagocytic immune cell functions as well as perivascular fluid flow; however, the need for active drainage of waste from the brain is becoming increasingly appreciated. Recent developments in lymphatic vascular biology challenge the proposition that the brain lacks lymphatic drainage or an equivalent. In this review, we describe the roles of the glymphatic system (a key drainage mechanism in the absence of lymphatics), the recently characterized meningeal lymphatic vessels, and explore an enigmatic cell population found in zebrafish called mural lymphatic endothelial cells. These systems may play important individual and collective roles in draining and clearing wastes from the brain."
"Vasculogenesis has been shown to contribute to the formation of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). However, the mechanism behind the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to CNV is not well understood. Therefore, we were interested to know whether integrin-linked kinase (ILK) plays a role in recruiting EPC to CNV, and its possible mechanism.We investigated the effect of hypoxia on retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells expressing ILK, hypoxia-inducible factor 1? (HIF-1?), stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and we further examined the effect of ILK small interfering RNA (siRNA) on their expression. The function of ILK expressed by RPE on EPC in vitro with regard to angiogenic effect was also studied. In vivo, we determined the expression levels of the above factors in CNV. We also examined the role of ILK on their expression, on EPC recruiting, and on the growth of CNV.We found that hypoxia strongly induced the expression of ILK, HIF-1?, SDF-1, and VEGF. Moreover, the silencing of ILK attenuated their expression. It also decreased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) and nearly abolished the proliferation, migration, and adhesion of EPC to RPE cells. In vivo, we showed that these factors were upregulated in CNV. Inhibiting the expression of ILK prohibited the ""homing"" of EPC to CNV lesions and attenuated the growth of CNV.We demonstrate that ILK controls the development of CNV by regulating the recruitment of EPC to CNV lesions, possibly through ILK-dependent expression of SDF-1 and VEGF in RPE."
"To determine whether human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (iPS-RPE) can suppress natural killer (NK) cell activation.iPS-RPE cells were cocultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or purified NK cells from healthy donors after stimulation with cytokines. To confirm expression of NK cell-specific markers, flow cytometry and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) were performed. NK cells (or PBMCs) cocultured with iPS-RPE cells were assessed for proliferation by Ki-67 expression with flow cytometry, and NK suppression by RPE cells was assessed for granzyme B production with ELISA. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression including HLA-E on iPS-RPE cells was evaluated with flow cytometry and qRT-PCR. The effect of HLA-E downregulation was also investigated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) systems. Following iPS-RPE cell transplantation in vivo, we evaluated NK cell invasion in the retina with immunohistochemistry.Activated NK cells expressed NK-related markers such as CD16, CD56, and CD11b, and NK cells produced cytotoxic agents such as granzyme B, perforin, and TNF-?. Human iPS-RPE cells inhibited cell proliferation and production of these cytotoxic agents by activated NK cells in vitro. iPS-RPE cells constitutively expressed HLA-E and suppressed NK cell activation through an interaction between HLA-E and CD94/NKG2A. Moreover, immunohistochemical evaluation of monkey RPE transplantation into in vivo immune rejection models showed no NK cell invasion in the retina in allografts or xenografts except for one xenografted eye.Cultured iPS cell-derived RPE cells greatly suppress NK cell activation. Thus, NK cells might be inactivated when exposed to this type of retinal cell."
"The nitric oxide/soluble guanylate cyclase/protein kinase G (NO/sGC/PKG) is known to be involved in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP) and may be dysregulated in glaucoma. The purpose is to demonstrate that the sGC activator MGV354 lowers IOP in a monkey model of glaucoma and could be considered as a possible new clinical drug candidate.Changes to cGMP were assessed in primary human trabecular meshwork (hNTM) cells and binding studies were conducted using human sGC full-length protein. Ocular safety tolerability, exposure, and efficacy studies were conducted in rabbit and monkey models following topical ocular dosing of MGV354.sGC was highly expressed in the human and cynomolgus monkey outflow pathways. MGV354 had a 7-fold greater Bmax to oxidized sGC compared to that of reduced sGC and generated an 8- to 10-fold greater cGMP compared to that of a reduced condition in hTM cells. A single topical ocular dose with MGV354 caused a significant dose-dependent reduction of 20% to 40% (versus vehicle), lasting up to 6 hours in pigmented rabbits and 24 hours postdose in a cynomolgus monkey model of glaucoma. The MGV354-induced IOP lowering was sustained up to 7 days following once-daily dosing in a monkey model of glaucoma and was greater in magnitude compared to Travatan (travoprost)-induced IOP reduction. Mild to moderate ocular hyperemia was the main adverse effect noted.MGV354 represents a novel class of sGC activators that can lower IOP in preclinical models of glaucoma. The potential for sGC activators to be used as effective IOP-lowering drugs in glaucoma patients could be further determined in clinical studies."
"In aerobic organisms, mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP-synthase is the major site of ATP production. Beside this fundamental role, the protein complex is involved in shaping and maintenance of cristae. Previous electron microscopic studies identified the dissociation of F1Fo-ATP-synthase dimers and oligomers during organismic aging correlating with a massive remodeling of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here we report results aimed to experimentally proof this impact and to obtain further insights into the control of these processes. We focused on the role of the two dimer assembly factors PaATPE and PaATPG of the aging modelPodospora anserina. Ablation of either protein strongly affects mitochondrial function and leads to an accumulation of senescence markers demonstrating that the inhibition of dimer formation negatively influences vital functions and accelerates organismic aging. Our data validate a model that links mitochondrial membrane remodeling to aging and identify specific molecular components triggering this process."
"Several yeast species, belonging toSaccharomycesand non-Saccharomycesgenera, play fundamental roles during spontaneous must grape fermentation, and recent studies have shown that mixed fermentations, co-inoculated withS. cerevisiaeand non-Saccharomycesstrains, can improve wine organoleptic properties. During active dry yeast (ADY) production, antioxidant systems play an essential role in yeast survival and vitality as both biomass propagation and dehydration cause cellular oxidative stress and negatively affect technological performance. Mechanisms for adaptation and resistance to desiccation have been described forS. cerevisiae,but no data are available on the physiology and oxidative stress response of non-Saccharomyceswine yeasts and their potential impact on ADY production. In this study we analyzed the oxidative stress response in several non-Saccharomycesyeast species by measuring the activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes, e.g., catalase and glutathione reductase, accumulation of protective metabolites, e.g., trehalose and reduced glutathione (GSH), and lipid and protein oxidation levels. Our data suggest that non-canonical regulation of glutathione and trehalose biosynthesis could cause poor fermentative performance after ADY production, as it corroborates the corrective effect of antioxidant treatments, during biomass propagation, with both pure chemicals and food-grade argan oil."
"The species of poorly known but charismatic generaHaematodesLaporte, 1835 andWeiserianumBernhauer, 1927 are revised.Weiserianumsyn. nov.is considered a junior synonym ofHaematodes, withHaematodes kuntzeni(Scheerpeltz, 1936)comb. nov.Weiserianum woltersiBernhauer, 1927syn. nov.is treated as a synonym ofHaematodes tenuipesKraatz, 1858.Haematodes myterossp. nov., is described from Paraguay and Brazil. As the type series ofHaematodes bicolorLaporte, 1835 is considered lost, a neotype, selected from the original type locality is designated. We also designate a lectotype forH. tenuipesKraatz, 1858 to stabilize nomenclature for this species, which is similar toH. myteros. As far as known,Haematodesis restricted to the southern Neotropical region and may be nest parasites withinAcromyrmexandAttaant nests as are species of the related genusScariphaeus, but no direct observations are yet available. We provide a key to the four known species ofHaematodesand illustrate their diagnostic features."
"Non-aureus staphylococci (NAS) are most commonly isolated from subclinical mastitis. Different NAS species may, however, have diverse effects on the inflammatory response in the udder. We determined the genome sequences of 20 staphylococcal isolates from clinical or subclinical bovine mastitis, belonging to the NAS speciesStaphylococcus agnetis, S. chromogenes,andS. simulans, and focused on the putative virulence factor genes present in the genomes. For comparison we used our previously published genome sequences of fourS. aureusisolates from bovine mastitis. The pan-genome and core genomes of the non-aureus isolates were characterized. After that, putative virulence factor orthologues were searchedin silico. We compared the presence of putative virulence factors in the NAS species andS. aureusand evaluated the potential association between bacterial genotype and type of mastitis (clinical vs. subclinical). The NAS isolates had much less virulence gene orthologues than theS. aureusisolates. One third of the virulence genes were detected only inS. aureus. About 100 virulence genes were present in allS. aureusisolates, compared to about 40 to 50 in each NAS isolate.S. simulansdiffered the most. Several of the virulence genes detected among NAS were harbored only byS. simulans, but it also lacked a number of genes present both inS. agnetisandS. chromogenes. The type of mastitis was not associated with any specific virulence gene profile. It seems that the virulence gene profiles or cumulative number of different virulence genes are not directly associated with the type of mastitis (clinical or subclinical), indicating that host derived factors such as the immune status play a pivotal role in the manifestation of mastitis."
"The Longdong Stream SalamanderBatrachuperus londongensis, living in a mountain stream environment at Mt. Emei in Sichuan Province, China, represents a rare species that is facultatively neotenic in the family Hynobiidae. Although the species has been known to science for some 40 years since its initial discovery in the late 1970s, anatomical details of its osteology remain poorly understood and developmental information is still lacking for the species. This study (1) provides a detailed osteological account ofB. londongensisbased on micro-CT scanning and clearing and staining of multiple specimens from the type locality; (2) provides a discussion of intraspecific variation related to life-history differences; and (3) presents a discussion on limb features related to morphological evolution of limb patterns correlative with ecological adaptation to mountain stream environments. Osteological comparisons with congeneric species has led to recognition of several diagnostic features that are unique toB. londongensis, including: vomers widely separated from one another, lacking a midline contact; presence of uncommon perichondral ossification of the ascending process of the palatoquadrate as part of the suspensorium; and presence of a prominent posterodorsal process of the scapular blade, which serves as a ligamentous insertion of the levator muscle of the scapula. In addition, some but not all neotenic individuals retain the palatine as a discrete element, indicative of its delayed absorption after sexual maturity. Postmetamorphic and neotenic individuals are strikingly different in the complexity of hyobranchial structures. Neotenes display a high degree of ossification of hyobranchial elements, tend to increase ossification of both hypobranchial I and ceratobranchial I during aging, and retain fully ossified ceratobranchial III and IV; in contrast, these elements remain entirely cartilaginous or are totally lost by resorption in postmetamorphic individuals. In addition, all postmetamorphic forms display an inverted ""T""-shaped basibranchial II, whereas neotenes show transformation from a ""fork""-shaped to the ""T""-shaped configuration after sexual maturity.B. londongensisdisplays a mosaic of apomorphic and plesiomorphic states in its limb ossifications: presence of a single centrale element in both the manus and pes is a derived condition in Hynobiidae and other families as well, whereas retention of a postminimus in the pes is obviously plesiomorphic within Urodela. Reduction in number of digits from five to four in the pes and possession of a cornified sheath covering the terminal phalanges are also derived features shared with some but not all mountain stream salamanders that are adapted to a similar type of environment."
"Biological wastewater treatment is economically feasible and ecofriendly. This study was aimed at isolating bacteria from brewery wastes and evaluating their bioremediation potential as individual isolate and/or their consortium in reducing the pollutants of brewery effluents. A total of 40 bacterial isolates were recovered and of these the three best isolates were selected. The selected bacteria were identified to genus level by using morphological and biochemical characteristics. Accordingly, the isolates were identified asAeromonassp.,Pseudomonassp., andBacillussp. After 12 days of incubation, the removal efficiency of these three isolates and their combinations for biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand varied from 73.55% to 94.85% and 76.78% to 93.25%, respectively. Total nitrogen and phosphorus removal was within the range of 54.43% to 77.21% and 41.80% to 78.18%, respectively. Total suspended solid, total solid, and total dissolved solids removal ranged from 66.74% to 90.3%, 54.69% to 88.5%, and 53.02% to 88.2%, respectively. The pH and electrical conductivity values ranged from 6.81 to 8.65 and 3.31?mS/cm to 3.67?mS/cm, respectively. The treated effluent increasedBeta vulgarisseeds germination from 80% to 100%, with mean germination time of 3.1 to 5.2 days and seedlings length of 2.3?cm to 6.3?cm. Therefore, the development of this finding into a large scale offers an attractive technology for brewery waste treatment."
"Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. According to global genomic status, colorectal cancer can be classified into two main types: microsatellite-stable and microsatellite-instable tumors. Moreover, the two subtypes also exhibit different responses to chemotherapeutic agents through distinctive molecular mechanisms. Recently, mitochondrial DNA depletion has been shown to induce apoptotic resistance in microsatellite-instable colorectal cancer. However, the effects of altered mitochondrial DNA copy number on the progression of microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer, which accounts for the majority of colorectal cancer, remain unclear. In this study, we systematically investigated the functional role of altered mitochondrial DNA copy number in the survival and metastasis of microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, the underlying molecular mechanisms were also explored. Our results demonstrated that increased mitochondrial DNA copy number by forced mitochondrial transcription factor A expression significantly facilitated cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that increased mitochondrial DNA copy number enhanced the metastasis of microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer cells. Mechanistically, the survival advantage conferred by increased mitochondrial DNA copy number was caused in large part by elevated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, treatment with oligomycin significantly suppressed the survival and metastasis of microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer cells with increased mitochondrial DNA copy number. Our study provides evidence supporting a possible tumor-promoting role for mitochondrial DNA and uncovers the underlying mechanism, which suggests a potential novel therapeutic target for microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer."
"Canine DNA-testing has become an important tool in purebred dog breeding and many breeders use genetic testing results when planning their breeding strategies. In addition, information obtained from testing of hundreds dogs in one breed gives valuable information about the breed-wide genotype frequency of disease associated allele. Lafora disease is a late onset, recessively inherited genetic disease which is diagnosed in Miniature Wirehaired Dachshunds (MWHD). It is one of the most severe forms of canine epilepsy leading to neurodegeneration and, frequently euthanasia within a few years of diagnosis. Canine Lafora disease is caused by a dodecamer repeat expansion mutation in theNHLRC1gene and a DNA test is available to identify homozygous dogs at risk, carriers and dogs free of the mutation.Blood samples were collected from 733 MWHDs worldwide, mostly of UK origin, for canine Lafora disease testing. Among the tested MWHD population 7.0% were homozygous for the mutation and at risk for Lafora disease. In addition, 234 dogs were heterozygous, indicating a carrier frequency of 31.9% in the tested population. Among the tested MWHDs, the mutant allele frequency was 0.2. In addition, data from the tested dogs over 6 years (2012-2017) indicated that the frequency of the homozygous and carrier dogs has decreased from 10.4% to 2.7% and 41.5% to 25.7%, respectively among MWHDs tested. As a consequence, the frequency of dogs free of the mutation has increased from 48.1% to 71.6%.This study provides valuable data for the MWHD community and shows that the DNA test is a useful tool for the breeders to prevent occurrence of Lafora disease in MWHDs. DNA testing has, over 6 years, helped to decrease the frequency of carriers and dogs at risk. Additionally, the DNA test can continue to be used to slowly eradicate the disease-causing mutation in the breed. However, this should be done carefully, over time, to avoid further compromising the genetic diversity of the breed. The DNA test also provides a diagnostic tool for veterinarians if they are presented with a dog that shows clinical signs associated with canine Lafora disease."
"The extent to which seasonal changes in food availability affect small-scale movements in free-ranging populations of birds of prey is relatively little studied. Here we describe a seasonal ""micro-migration"" of a farm-island population of striated caracaras (Phalcoboenus australis) in the Falkland Islands in response to seasonal changes in the availability of seabird carcasses. We banded more than 450 individuals on Saunders Island, deployed archival and satellite GPS data loggers on 17 individuals, and monitored movements within and between two feeding areas on Saunders Island, a ""marine-subsidized"" site near seabird colonies and an anthropogenic ""human-subsidized"" farm site 16 km to the southeast.During 67 observation days between 2010 and 2015, resightings of 312 banded caracaras were greater at the marine-subsidized site during austral summer than winter, and the total daily resightings varied significantly between spring versus summer, summer versus winter, autumn versus spring, and autumn versus winter. Resightings were higher at the human-subsidized site in austral winter than summer and the total daily resightings varied significantly across all bi-seasonal comparisons. Resightings indicated that at least 12 of 197 birds (6.1%) moved between the human- and marine-subsidized sites at least once during the same winter, 15 of 335 birds (4.5%) did so in spring, none of 164 birds did so in summer, and 16 of 297 birds (5.4%) did so in autumn. Individuals fitted with archival GPS data loggers at the marine-subsidized site in summer maintained highly localized 95% kernel core areas (0.55?±?0.12 km2[mean?±?SD]), whereas those at the human-subsidized site in winter maintained larger 95% kernel core areas (3.8?±?4.6 km2). Two of 6 satellite-tagged individuals that summered at known caracara breeding colonies 80 km WNW of Saunders Island were subsequently resighted in winter at the human-subsidized site.Our results suggest that seasonal shifts in food resource availability drive seasonal micro-migrations in a farm-island population of striated caracaras, and that farm sites can be critical in providing nutritional resources for caracaras when naturally occurring marine-subsidized resources become less available. Our results have important implications for striated caracara spatial ecology and conservation, as increased winter survival could improve the status of this globally Near-Threatened population."
"The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors is one of the largest superfamilies of regulatory transcription factors and is widely used in eukaryotic organisms. They play an essential role in a range of metabolic, physiological, and developmental processes, including the development of the nervous system (NS). These transcription factors have been studied in many metazoans, especially in vertebrates but also in early branching metazoan clades such as the cnidarians and sponges. However, currently very little is known about their expression in the most basally branching bilaterian group, the xenacoelomorphs. Recently, our laboratory has characterized the full complement of bHLH in the genome of two members of the Xenacoelomorpha, the xenoturbellidXenoturbella bockiand the acoelSymsagittifera roscoffensis. Understanding the patterns of bHLH gene expression in members of this phylum (in space and time) provides critical new insights into the conserved roles of the bHLH and their putative specificities in this group. Our focus is on deciphering the specific roles that these genes have in the process of neurogenesis.Here, we analyze the developmental expression of the whole complement of bHLH genes identified in the acoelS. roscoffensis.Based on their expression patterns, several members of bHLH class A appear to have specific conserved roles in neurogenesis, while other class A genes (as well as members of other classes) have likely taken on more generalized functions. All gene expression patterns are described in embryos and early juveniles.Our results suggest that the main roles of the bHLH genes ofS. roscoffensisare evolutionarily conserved, with a specific subset dedicated to patterning the nervous system: SrAscA, SrAscB, SrHes/Hey, SrNscl, SrSrebp, SrE12/E47 and SrOlig."
"Ovarian endometriotic cysts, also known as 'chocolate' cysts or ovarian endometriomas, appear as endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity which grows inside ovaries. Endometriotic cysts can cause chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, impairment of ovarian function in regards to subfertility, etc. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is effectively treating subfertility associated with endometriosis for years, and the treatment gives positive results in achieving pregnancy. With the acupuncture treatment, blood circulation is promoted, external physical factors - eliminated, the stasis is dissolved, the menstrual cycle is regulated, and inflammation is diminished.Our treated patient is 29-year-old woman diagnosed with ovarian endometrioma, slightly - elevated prolactin levels and inability to get pregnant after trying for two years. Ningteen acupuncture treatments were done on the meridians of Pericardium, Spleen, Stomach, Liver, Ren Mai, Kidney, Large intestine, Du Mai and Bladder. After the acupuncture treatments, the endometrioma was decreased in size and the patient got pregnant spontaneously in a short period.Acupuncture, as part of the TCM, gives positive results and can successfully add up to variety of non - surgical infertility treatment options in women with endometrioma(s)."
"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) accounts for 80% of the thyroid malignancies that are characterised by slow growth and an excellent prognosis. Over-expression of SMAD4 protein restores TGF-? signalling, determines a strong increase in anti-proliferative effect and reduces invasive potential of tumour cells expressing it.The study aimed to analyse the immunohistochemical expression of TGF-?1 and its downstream phosphorylated SMAD4, element and of the inhibitory SMAD7 PTC variants and their association with the localisation of TAMs within the tumour microenvironment.For this retrospective study we investigated 69 patients immunohistochemistry with antibodies against TGF-?, TGF - ?-RII, SMAD4, SMAD7, CD68+ macrophages.Patients with low infiltration with CD68+ cells in tumour stroma has significantly shorter survival (median of 129.267 months) compared to those with high CD68+ cells infiltration (p = 0.034). From the analysis of CD68+ cells in tumour border and tumour stroma correlated with expression of TGF-?1 / SMAD proteins, we observed that the positive expression of TGF-?1 in tumour cytoplasm, significantly correlated with increased number of CD68+ cells in tumour border (X2= 5,945; p = 0.015).TGF-? enhances motility and stimulates recruitment of monocytes, macrophages and other immune cells while directly inhibiting their anti-tumour effector functions."
"Surgery has its origins in caring for patients suffering from injury or infection. In the last decade, a huge amount of published data has been describing a wide range of conditions resulting from trauma or infection, from minor, local reactions to a surgical operation and leading to a systemic stress response, systemic inflammatory response and finally to multiple organ failure. Our aim was to highlight the main immunological aspects of liver resections. There are many types of liver resections, ranging from small, isolated resections for benign diseases (e.g., small cysts or angyoma) to segmentectomies, bi- or trisegmentectomies to hepatectomies in the end. Patients undergoing such resections are subjected to a large amount of surgical stress and in some cases, postoperative complications ranging from light to severe. The main links between immunology and liver resections is surgical stress that can be evaluated through various immunological methods, which will be presented in this article."
"Development of molecular techniques for rapid detection of drug resistant tuberculosis allows for the prompt initiation of appropriate anti-TB treatment. We aimed to assess high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the detection of rpsL, rrs and embB mutations to identify streptomycin and ethambutol resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.A total of 76 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis including 25 SM-R, 21 EB-R and 30 drug susceptible - determined by the proportion method of drug susceptibility testing (DST) - were analyzed by HRM analysis, and the results were confirmed using DNA sequencing.The sensitivity and specificity of the HRMA compared to phenotypic DST were 88% and 100.0%, respectively for the detection of streptomycin resistance (SM-R), and 90.4% and 96.6%, respectively for ethambutol resistance (EB-R). Three SM-R and two EB-R isolates had no mutations in the studied regions of rpsL, rrs and embB genes determined by DNA sequencing and therefore were not identified as resistant by HRM assay. Interestingly, one phenotypic EM-S isolate was found by sequencing to have a mutation at codon 423 (Met->Ilu) of embB gene and was clustered as resistant by HRM as well.The sensitivity and specificity of HRM curve assay was consistent with DNA sequencing, which is the gold standard method for genotypic DST. This assay can be utilized as a screening method for detection of drug-resistant tuberculosis, offering the advantages of a high throughput, single step, cost effectiveness, and rapid work flow method."
"LINE-1 (L1) is the dominant autonomously replicating non-LTR retrotransposon in mammals. Although our knowledge of L1 evolution across the tree of life has considerably improved in recent years, what we know of L1 evolution in mammals is biased and comes mostly from studies in primates (mostly human) and rodents (mostly mouse). It is unclear if patterns of evolution that are shared between those two groups apply to other mammalian orders. Here we performed a detailed study on the evolution of L1 in perissodactyls by making use of the complete genome of the domestic horse and of the white rhinoceros. This mammalian order offers an excellent model to study the extinction of L1 since the rhinoceros is one of the few mammalian species to have lost active L1.We found that multiple L1 lineages, carrying different 5'UTRs, have been simultaneously active during the evolution of perissodactyls. We also found that L1 has continuously amplified and diversified in horse. In rhinoceros, L1 was very prolific early on. Two successful families were simultaneously active until ~20my ago but became extinct suddenly at exactly the same time.The general pattern of L1 evolution in perissodactyls is very similar to what was previously described in mouse and human, suggesting some commonalities in the way mammalian genomes interact with L1. We confirmed the extinction of L1 in rhinoceros and we discuss several possible mechanisms."
"Pancreatic cancer exhibits a worst prognosis owed to an aggressive tumor progression i.a. driven by chemoresistance or tumor-stroma-interactions. The identification of candidate genes, which promote this progression, can lead to new therapeutic targets and might improve patient's outcome. The identification of these candidates in a plethora of genes requires suitable screening protocols. The aim of the present study was to establish a universally usable device which ensures versatile cultivation, screening and handling protocols of cancer cells with the 3D spheroid model, an approved model to study tumor biology. By surface modification and alternative handling of a commercial 384-well plate, a modified device enabling (i) 3D cultivation either by liquid overlay or by a modified hanging drop method for (ii) screening of substances as well as for tumor-stroma-interactions (iii) either with manual or automated handling was established. The here presented preliminary results of cell line dependent dose-response-relations and a stromal-induced spheroid-formation of the pancreatic cancer cells demonstrate the proof-of-principle of the versatile functionality of this device. By adapting the protocols to automation, a higher reproducibility and the ability for high-throughput analyses were ensured."
"The present study was carried out to investigate the hypoglycemic effect of soy isoflavones from hypocotyl in GK diabetic rats. A single administration and long-term administration tests were conducted in GK diabetic rats to test the hypoglycemic effect of soy isoflavones. At the end of long-term administration trial, blood protein, cholesterol, triglyceride, glycosylated serum protein, C-reactive protein, insulin, aminotransferase, lipid peroxide, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-? were estimated. Inhibition of soy isoflavones against ?-amylase and ?-glucosidase, as well as on glucose uptake into brush border membrane vesicles or Caco-2 cells were determinedin vitro. In single administration experiment, soy isoflavones reduced postprandial blood glucose levels in GK rats. In long-term administration, hypoglycemic effect of soy isoflavones was first observed at week 12 and maintained till week 16. A significant reduction in fasting blood glucose, C-reactive protein, and lipid peroxide was noted at week 16. However, there was no significant treatment effect on blood insulin. Furthermore, soy isoflavone administration resulted in significant decreases in glycosylated serum protein, tumor necrosis factor-?, and interleukin-6. Other biochemical parameters, such as protein, cholesterol, triglyceride and aminotransferases were not modified, however. The resultsin vitroshowed that soy isoflavones showed a potent inhibitory effect on intestinal ?-glucosidase, but not on pancreatic ?-amylase. Soy isoflavones also decreased glucose transport potency into brush border membrane vesicles or Caco-2 cells. It is concluded that soy isoflavones from hypocotyl, performs hypoglycemic function in GK rats with type 2 diabetes, maybe via suppression of carbohydrate digestion and glucose uptake in small intestine."
"Hyperproduced prostaglandin E2by cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 evokes several pathophysiological responses such as inflammation and carcinogenesis. Our recent study demonstrated thatDioscorea japonicaextract suppressed the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 and induced apoptosis in lung carcinoma A549 cells. In the present study, we investigated the effects ofDioscorea japonicaon squamous cell carcinoma of mouse skin.Dioscorea japonicafeeding andDioscorea japonicaextract topical application suppressed the expression of cyclooxygenase-2, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1, interleukin-1? and interleukin-6 and inhibited tumor formation, hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration. Immunohistochemical analyses showed the immunoreactivities of cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 in tumor keratinocytes and stronger immunoreactivities of cyclooxygenase-2 and hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase in epidermal dendritic cells (Langerhans cells). Treatment withDioscorea japonicadecreased the immunoreactivity of cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1. These results indicate thatDioscorea japonicamay have inhibitory effects on inflammation and carcinogenesis via suppression of the prostaglandin E2synthetic pathway."
"Students' ability to accurately self-assess their performance and select a suitable subsequent learning task in response is imperative for effective self-regulated learning. Video modeling examples have proven effective for training self-assessment and task-selection skills, and-importantly-such training fostered self-regulated learning outcomes. It is unclear, however, whether trained skills would transfer across domains. We investigated whether skills acquired from training with either a specific, algorithmic task-selection rule or a more general heuristic task-selection rule in biology would transfer to self-regulated learning in math. A manipulation check performed after the training confirmed that both algorithmic and heuristic training improved task-selection skills on the biology problems compared with the control condition. However, we found no evidence that students subsequently applied the acquired skills during self-regulated learning in math. Future research should investigate how to support transfer of task-selection skills across domains."
"Students tend to be very interested in medical issues that affect them and their friends and family. Using cancer as a hook, the ART of Reproductive Medicine: Oncofertility curriculum (free, online, and NIH sponsored) has been developed to supplement the teaching of basic biological concepts and to connect biology and biomedical research. This approach allows integration of up-to-date information on cancer and cancer treatment, cell division, male and female reproductive anatomy and physiology, cryopreservation, fertility preservation, stem cells, ethics, and epigenetics into an existing biology curriculum. Many of the topics covered in the curriculum relate to other scientific disciplines, such as the latest developments in stem cell research including tissue bioengineering and gene therapy for inherited mitochondrial disease, how epigenetics occurs chemically to affect gene expression or suppression and how it can be passed down through the generations, and the variety of biomedical careers students could pursue. The labs are designed to be open-ended and inquiry-based, and extensions to the experiments are provided so that students can explore questions further. Case studies and ethical dilemmas are provided to encourage thoughtful discussion. In addition, each chapter of the curriculum includes links to scientific papers, additional resources on each topic, and NGSS alignment."
"Photosystem I (PSI), a large protein complex located in the thylakoid membrane, mediates the final step in light-driven electron transfer to the stromal electron carrier protein ferredoxin (Fd). Here, we report the first structural description of the PSI-Fd complex from Thermosynechococcus elongatus. The trimeric PSI complex binds three Fds in a non-equivalent manner. While each is recognized by a PSI protomer in a similar orientation, the distances between Fds and the PSI redox centres differ. Fd binding thus entails loss of the exact three-fold symmetry of the PSI's soluble subunits, inducing structural perturbations which are transferred to the lumen through PsaF. Affinity chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of PSI-Fd complexes support the existence of two different Fd-binding states, with one Fd being more tightly bound than the others. We propose a dynamic structural basis for productive complex formation, which supports fast electron transfer between PSI and Fd."
"The potential for maternal nanoparticle (NP) exposures to cause developmental toxicity in the fetus without the direct passage of NPs has previously been shown, but the mechanism remained elusive. We now demonstrate that exposure of cobalt and chromium NPs to BeWo cell barriers, an in vitro model of the human placenta, triggers impairment of the autophagic flux and release of interleukin-6. This contributes to the altered differentiation of human neural progenitor cells and DNA damage in the derived neurons and astrocytes. Crucially, neuronal DNA damage is mediated by astrocytes. Inhibiting the autophagic degradation in the BeWo barrier by overexpression of the dominant-negative human ATG4BC74Asignificantly reduces the levels of DNA damage in astrocytes. In vivo, indirect NP toxicity in mice results in neurodevelopmental abnormalities with reactive astrogliosis and increased DNA damage in the fetal hippocampus. Our results demonstrate the potential importance of autophagy to elicit NP toxicity and the risk of indirect developmental neurotoxicity after maternal NP exposure."
"ABCG2 is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that protects tissues against xenobiotics, affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs and contributes to multidrug resistance. Although many inhibitors and modulators of ABCG2 have been developed, understanding their structure-activity relationship requires high-resolution structural insight. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of human ABCG2 bound to synthetic derivatives of the fumitremorgin C-related inhibitor Ko143 or the multidrug resistance modulator tariquidar. Both compounds are bound to the central, inward-facing cavity of ABCG2, blocking access for substrates and preventing conformational changes required for ATP hydrolysis. The high resolutions allowed for de novo building of the entire transporter and also revealed tightly bound phospholipids and cholesterol interacting with the lipid-exposed surface of the transmembrane domains (TMDs). Extensive chemical modifications of the Ko143 scaffold combined with in vitro functional analyses revealed the details of ABCG2 interactions with this compound family and provide a basis for the design of novel inhibitors and modulators."
"Thermostable cross-? structures are characteristic of pathological amyloid fibrils, but these structures cannot explain the reversible nature of fibrils formed by RNA-binding proteins such as fused in sarcoma (FUS), involved in RNA granule assembly. Here, we find that two tandem (S/G)Y(S/G) motifs of the human FUS low-complexity domain (FUS LC) form reversible fibrils in a temperature- and phosphorylation-dependent manner. We named these motifs reversible amyloid cores, or RAC1 and RAC2, and determined their atomic structures in fibrillar forms, using microelectron and X-ray diffraction techniques. The RAC1 structure features an ordered-coil fibril spine rather than the extended ?-strand typical of amyloids. Ser42, a phosphorylation site of FUS, is critical in the maintenance of the ordered-coil structure, which explains how phosphorylation controls fibril formation. The RAC2 structure shows a labile fibril spine with a wet interface. These structures illuminate the mechanism of reversible fibril formation and dynamic assembly of RNA granules."
"Although cancer genomes are replete with noncoding mutations, the effects of these mutations remain poorly characterized. Here we perform an integrative analysis of 930 tumor whole genomes and matched transcriptomes, identifying a network of 193 noncoding loci in which mutations disrupt target gene expression. These 'somatic eQTLs' (expression quantitative trait loci) are frequently mutated in specific cancer tissues, and the majority can be validated in an independent cohort of 3,382 tumors. Among these, we find that the effects of noncoding mutations on DAAM1, MTG2 and HYI transcription are recapitulated in multiple cancer cell lines and that increasing DAAM1 expression leads to invasive cell migration. Collectively, the noncoding loci converge on a set of core pathways, permitting a classification of tumors into pathway-based subtypes. The somatic eQTL network is disrupted in 88% of tumors, suggesting widespread impact of noncoding mutations in cancer."
"The functional impact of most genomic alterations found in cancer, alone or in combination, remains largely unknown. Here we integrate tumor barcoding, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing and ultra-deep barcode sequencing to interrogate pairwise combinations of tumor suppressor alterations in autochthonous mouse models of human lung adenocarcinoma. We map the tumor suppressive effects of 31 common lung adenocarcinoma genotypes and identify a landscape of context dependence and differential effect strengths."
"Comprehensive genomic characterization of prostate cancer has identified recurrent alterations in genes involved in androgen signaling, DNA repair, and PI3K signaling, among others. However, larger and uniform genomic analysis may identify additional recurrently mutated genes at lower frequencies. Here we aggregate and uniformly analyze exome sequencing data from 1,013 prostate cancers. We identify and validate a new class of E26 transformation-specific (ETS)-fusion-negative tumors defined by mutations in epigenetic regulators, as well as alterations in pathways not previously implicated in prostate cancer, such as the spliceosome pathway. We find that the incidence of significantly mutated genes (SMGs) follows a long-tail distribution, with many genes mutated in less than 3% of cases. We identify a total of 97 SMGs, including 70 not previously implicated in prostate cancer, such as the ubiquitin ligase CUL3 and the transcription factor SPEN. Finally, comparing primary and metastatic prostate cancer identifies a set of genomic markers that may inform risk stratification."
"To understand ecological phenomena, it is necessary to observe their behaviour across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Since this need was first highlighted in the 1980s, technology has opened previously inaccessible scales to observation. To help to determine whether there have been corresponding changes in the scales observed by modern ecologists, we analysed the resolution, extent, interval and duration of observations (excluding experiments) in 348 studies that have been published between 2004 and 2014. We found that observational scales were generally narrow, because ecologists still primarily use conventional field techniques. In the spatial domain, most observations had resolutions ?1?m2and extents ?10,000?ha. In the temporal domain, most observations were either unreplicated or infrequently repeated (>1?month interval) and ?1 year in duration. Compared with studies conducted before 2004, observational durations and resolutions appear largely unchanged, but intervals have become finer and extents larger. We also found a large gulf between the scales at which phenomena are actually observed and the scales those observations ostensibly represent, raising concerns about observational comprehensiveness. Furthermore, most studies did not clearly report scale, suggesting that it remains a minor concern. Ecologists can better understand the scales represented by observations by incorporating autocorrelation measures, while journals can promote attentiveness to scale by implementing scale-reporting standards."
"Hox genes exert fundamental roles for proper regional specification along the main rostro-caudal axis of animal embryos. They are generally expressed in restricted spatial domains according to their position in the cluster (spatial colinearity)-a feature that is conserved across bilaterians. In jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), the position in the cluster also determines the onset of expression of Hox genes (a feature known as whole-cluster temporal colinearity (WTC)), while in invertebrates this phenomenon is displayed as a subcluster-level temporal colinearity. However, little is known about the expression profile of Hox genes in jawless vertebrates (cyclostomes); therefore, the evolutionary origin of WTC, as seen in gnathostomes, remains a mystery. Here, we show that Hox genes in cyclostomes are expressed according to WTC during development. We investigated the Hox repertoire and Hox gene expression profiles in three different species-a hagfish, a lamprey and a shark-encompassing the two major groups of vertebrates, and found that these are expressed following a whole-cluster, temporally staggered pattern, indicating that WTC has been conserved during the past 500?million years despite drastically different genome evolution and morphological outputs between jawless and jawed vertebrates."
"DNA-encoded libraries have emerged as a widely used resource for the discovery of bioactive small molecules, and offer substantial advantages compared with conventional small-molecule libraries. Here, we have developed and streamlined multiple fundamental aspects of DNA-encoded and DNA-templated library synthesis methodology, including computational identification and experimental validation of a 20?×?20?×?20?×?80 set of orthogonal codons, chemical and computational tools for enhancing the structural diversity and drug-likeness of library members, a highly efficient polymerase-mediated template library assembly strategy, and library isolation and purification methods. We have integrated these improved methods to produce a second-generation DNA-templated library of 256,000 small-molecule macrocycles with improved drug-like physical properties. In vitro selection of this library for insulin-degrading enzyme affinity resulted in novel insulin-degrading enzyme inhibitors, including one of unusual potency and novel macrocycle stereochemistry (IC50?=?40?nM). Collectively, these developments enable DNA-templated small-molecule libraries to serve as more powerful, accessible, streamlined and cost-effective tools for bioactive small-molecule discovery."
"Schwann cell differentiation and myelination in the peripheral nervous system are the result of fine-tuning of positive and negative transcriptional regulators. As myelination starts, negative regulators are down-regulated whereas positive ones are up-regulated. Fully differentiated Schwann cells maintain an extraordinary plasticity, and can transdifferentiate into ""repair"" Schwann cells after nerve injury. Reactivation of negative regulators of myelination is essential to generate repair Schwann cells. Negative regulators have also been implicated in demyelinating neuropathies, although their role in disease remains elusive. Here we show that in a mouse model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1B, the P0S63del mouse characterized by ER-stress and the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), adult Schwann cells are in a partial differentiation state as they overexpress transcription factors that are normally expressed only prior to myelination. We provide evidence that two of these factors, namely Sox2 and Id2, act as negative regulators of myelinationin vivo.However, their sustained expression in neuropathy is protective, as ablation of Sox2 or/and Id2 from S63del mice of both sexes results in worsening of the dysmyelinating phenotype. This is accompanied by increased levels of mutant P0 expression and exacerbation of ER-stress, suggesting that limited differentiation may represent a novel adaptive mechanism through which Schwann cells counter the toxic effect of a mutant terminal differentiation protein.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn many neuropathies, Schwann cells express high levels of early differentiation genes, but the significance of these altered expression remained unclear. Since many of these factors may act as negative regulators of myelination it was suggested that their mis-expression could contribute to dysmyelination. Here we show that the transcription factors Sox2 and Id2 act as negative regulators of myelinationin vivo, but that their sustained expression in CMT1B represents an adaptive response activated by the Schwann cells to reduce mutant protein toxicity and prevent demyelination."
"Cardiovascular disease and susceptibility to infection are leading causes of morbidity and mortality for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). A major contributor to these is autonomic dysreflexia (AD), an amplified reaction of the autonomic nervous system (hallmarked by severe hypertension) in response to sensory stimuli below the injury. Maladaptive plasticity of the spinal sympathetic reflex circuit below the SCI results in AD intensification over time. Mechanisms underlying this maladaptive plasticity are poorly understood, restricting the identification of treatments. Thus, no preventative treatments are currently available. Neuroinflammation has been implicated in other pathologies associated with hyper-excitable neural circuits. Specifically, the soluble form of tumor necrosis ? (sTNF?) is known to play a role in neuroplasticity. We hypothesize that persistent expression of sTNF? in spinal cord underlies AD exacerbation. To test this, we intrathecally administered XPro1595, a biologic that renders sTNF? non-functional, after complete, high-level SCI in female rats. This dramatically attenuated the intensification of colorectal distension-induced and naturally-occurring AD events. This improvement is mediated via decreased sprouting of nociceptive primary afferents and activation of the spinal sympathetic reflex circuit. We also examined peripheral vascular function usingex vivopressurized arterial preparations and immune function via flow cytometric analysis of splenocytes. Diminishing AD via pharmacological inhibition of sTNF? mitigated ensuing vascular hyper-sensitivity and immune dysfunction. This is the first demonstration that neuroinflammation-induced sTNF? is critical for altering the spinal sympathetic reflex circuit, elucidating a novel mechanism for AD. Importantly, we identify the first potential pharmacological, prophylactic treatment for this life-threatening syndrome.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAutonomic dysreflexia (AD), a disorder that develops after spinal cord injury (SCI) and is hallmarked by sudden, extreme hypertension, contributes to cardiovascular disease and susceptibility to infection, respectively, two leading causes of mortality and morbidity in SCI patients. We demonstrate that neuroinflammation-induced expression of soluble TNF? (sTNF?) plays a critical role in AD, elucidating a novel underlying mechanism. We found that intrathecal administration post-SCI of a biologic that inhibits sTNF? signaling dramatically attenuates AD and significantly reduces AD-associated peripheral vascular and immune dysfunction. We identified mechanisms behind diminished plasticity of neuronal populations within the spinal sympathetic reflex circuit. This study is the first to pinpoint a potential pharmacological, prophylactic strategy to attenuate AD and ensuing cardiovascular and immune dysfunction."
"Innate lymphocytes play critical roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis and integrity of the host at steady state and during pathogenic insults. The successive identification of new innate lymphocyte subsets has revealed an incredible diversity within the family. While this heterogeneous population can be grouped based on their cytotoxic potential into exclusively cytokine-producing helpers and cytolytic killers, the exact developmental relationships between the subsets are not fully understood. The former group is enriched at mucosal surfaces, whereas innate lymphocytes with cytotoxic potential can be identified in a wider array of tissues, including tumors. Although their cytotoxicity suggests an antitumor role, the nature of tumor-elicited innate lymphocyte responses has only begun to be investigated, and the identities of participating subsets still remain contentious. In this review, we provide a brief overview of innate lymphocyte biology, review the current knowledge on their ontogeny, and discuss their roles in tumor immunosurveillance.Cancer Immunol Res; 6(4); 372-7. ©2018 AACR."
"                    Background
Ischemia during kidney transplant causes chronic allograft injury and adversely affects outcome, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. In tumors, oxygen shortage reduces the DNA demethylating activity of the ten-11 translocation (TET) enzymes, yielding hypermethylated genomes that promote tumor progression. We investigated whether ischemia similarly induces DNA hypermethylation in kidney transplants and contributes to chronic injury.MethodsWe profiled genome-wide DNA methylation in three cohorts of brain-dead donor kidney allograft biopsy specimens: a longitudinal cohort with paired biopsy specimens obtained at allograft procurement (preischemia;n=13), after implantation and reperfusion (postischemia;n=13), and at 3 or 12 months after transplant (n=5 each); a cross-sectional cohort with preimplantation biopsy specimens (n=82); and a cross-sectional cohort with postreperfusion biopsy specimens (n=46).ResultsAnalysis of the paired preischemia and postischemia specimens revealed that methylation increased drastically in all allografts on ischemia. Hypermethylation was caused by loss of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, the product of TET activity, and it was stable 1 year after transplant. In the preimplantation cohort, CpG hypermethylation directly correlated with ischemia time and for some CpGs, increased 2.6% per additional hour of ischemia. Hypermethylation preferentially affected and reduced the expression of genes involved in suppressing kidney injury and fibrosis. Moreover, CpG hypermethylation in preimplantation specimens predicted chronic injury, particularly fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis, 1 year after transplant. This finding was validated in the independent postreperfusion cohort, in which hypermethylation also predicted reduced allograft function 1 year after transplant, outperforming established clinical variables.ConclusionsWe highlight a novel epigenetic basis for ischemia-induced chronic allograft injury with biomarker potential."
"                    Background
Reabsorption of amino acids (AAs) across the renal proximal tubule is crucial for intracellular and whole organism AA homeostasis. Although the luminal transport step is well understood, with several diseases caused by dysregulation of this process, the basolateral transport step is not understood. In humans, only cationic aminoaciduria due to malfunction of the basolateral transporter y+LAT1/CD98hc (SLC7A7/SLC3A2), which mediates the export of cationic AAs, has been described. Thus, the physiologic roles of basolateral transporters of neutral AAs, such as the antiporter LAT2/CD98hc (SLC7A8/SLC3A2), a heterodimer that exports most neutral AAs, and the uniporter TAT1 (SLC16A10), which exports only aromatic AAs, remain unclear. Functional cooperation between TAT1 and LAT2/CD98hc has been suggested byin vitrostudies but has not been evaluatedin vivoMethodsTo study the functional relationship of TAT1 and LAT2/CD98hcin vivo, we generated a double-knockout mouse model lacking TAT1 and LAT2, the catalytic subunit of LAT2/CD98hc (dKO LAT2-TAT1 mice).ResultsCompared with mice lacking only TAT1 or LAT2, dKO LAT2-TAT1 mice lost larger amounts of aromatic and other neutral AAs in their urine due to a tubular reabsorption defect. Notably, dKO mice also displayed decreased tubular reabsorption of cationic AAs and increased expression of y+LAT1/CD98hc.ConclusionsThe LAT2/CD98hc and TAT1 transporters functionally cooperatein vivo, and y+LAT1/CD98hc may compensate for the loss of LAT2/CD98hc and TAT1, functioning as a neutral AA exporter at the expense of some urinary loss of cationic AAs. Cooperative and compensatory mechanisms of AA transporters may explain the lack of basolateral neutral aminoacidurias in humans."
"SummaryKeratins-types I and II-are the intermediate-filament-forming proteins expressed in epithelial cells. They are encoded by 54 evolutionarily conserved genes (28 type I, 26 type II) and regulated in a pairwise and tissue type-, differentiation-, and context-dependent manner. Here, we review how keratins serve multiple homeostatic and stress-triggered mechanical and nonmechanical functions, including maintenance of cellular integrity, regulation of cell growth and migration, and protection from apoptosis. These functions are tightly regulated by posttranslational modifications and keratin-associated proteins. Genetically determined alterations in keratin-coding sequences underlie highly penetrant and rare disorders whose pathophysiology reflects cell fragility or altered tissue homeostasis. Furthermore, keratin mutation or misregulation represents risk factors or genetic modifiers for several additional acute and chronic diseases."
"Metastatic adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Because of their slow growth and relative rarity, there is limited evidence for systemic therapy regimens. Recently, molecular profiling studies have begun to reveal the genetic landscape of these poorly understood cancers, and new treatment possibilities are beginning to emerge. The objective is to use whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing and analysis to better understand the genetic alterations underlying the pathology of metastatic and rare ACCs and determine potentially actionable therapeutic targets. We report five cases of metastatic ACC, not originating in the salivary glands, in patients enrolled in the Personalized Oncogenomics (POG) Program at the BC Cancer Agency. Genomic workup included whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, detailed analysis of tumor alterations, and integration with existing knowledge of drug-target combinations to identify potential therapeutic targets. Analysis reveals low mutational burden in these five ACC cases, and mutation signatures that are commonly observed in multiple cancer types. Notably, the only recurrent structural aberration identified was the well-describedMYB-NFIBfusion that was present in four of five cases, and one case exhibited a closely relatedMYBL1-NFIBfusion. Recurrent mutations were also identified in BAP1 and BCOR, with additional mutations in individual samples affecting NOTCH1 and the epigenetic regulators ARID2, SMARCA2, and SMARCB1. Copy changes were rare, and they included amplification of MYC and homozygous loss of CDKN2A in individual samples. Genomic analysis revealed therapeutic targets in all five cases and served to inform a therapeutic choice in three of the cases to date."
"Radioactive reagents have been gradually replaced by nonisotopic reagents for some tasks in molecular biology. Concern over laboratory safety and the economic and environmental aspects of radioactive waste disposal have been key factors in this change. Generally, the new nonisotopic systems have improved in terms of analytical sensitivity and the time required to obtain a result. The most prominent nonisotopic analytical methods exploit chemiluminescence, described here. This technique has been particularly effective when used in combination with an enzyme label, so that the amplifying properties of an enzyme label and the high sensitivity of a chemiluminescent detection reaction are combined to produce an ultrasensitive assay (e.g., chemiluminescent detection of peroxidase- and alkaline phosphatase-labeled proteins and nucleic acid probes). In all of the commonly used applications in molecular biology, the analytical performance of the chemiluminescent systems approaches that of125I- or32P-based systems. Chemiluminescent systems also avoid the lengthy signal detection times required with32P-based methods, yielding results in minutes rather than days. In addition, chemiluminescent probes can be easily stripped from membranes, allowing the membranes to be reprobed many times without significant loss of resolution. Experimental protocols for directly attaching nonisotopic labels to nucleic acids and indirect labeling methods based on biotin, fluorescein, and digoxigenin labels are now well established. The ancillary reagents (e.g., avidin, streptavidin, antidigoxigenin, and antifluorescein enzyme conjugates) required for the indirect methods are widely available."
"Recent studies point out the link between altered mitochondrial metabolism and cancer, and detailed understanding of mitochondrial metabolism requires real-time detection of its metabolites. Employing heteronuclear 2D NMR spectroscopy and13C3-pyruvate, we propose in-organelle metabolomics that allows for the monitoring of mitochondrial metabolic changes in real time. The approach identified acetyl phosphate from human mitochondria, whose production has been largely neglected in eukaryotic metabolism since its first description about 70 years ago in bacteria. The kinetic profile of acetyl phosphate formation was biphasic, and its transient nature suggested its role as a metabolic intermediate. The method also allowed for the estimation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme activity through monitoring of the acetyl-CoA formation, independent of competing cytosolic metabolism. The results confirmed the positive regulation of mitochondrial PDH activity by p53, a well-known tumor suppressor. Our approach can easily be applied to other organelle-specific metabolic studies."
"By tethering their circular genomes (episomes) to host chromatin, DNA tumor viruses ensure retention and segregation of their genetic material during cell divisions. Despite functional genetic and crystallographic studies, there is little information addressing the 3D structure of these tethers in cells, issues critical for understanding persistent infection by these viruses. Here, we have applied direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) to establish the nanoarchitecture of tethers within cells latently infected with the oncogenic human pathogen, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Each KSHV tether comprises a series of homodimers of the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) that bind with their C termini to the tandem array of episomal terminal repeats (TRs) and with their N termini to host chromatin. Superresolution imaging revealed that individual KSHV tethers possess similar overall dimensions and, in aggregate, fold to occupy the volume of a prolate ellipsoid. Using plasmids with increasing numbers of TRs, we found that tethers display polymer power law scaling behavior with a scaling exponent characteristic of active chromatin. For plasmids containing a two-TR tether, we determined the size, separation, and relative orientation of two distinct clusters of bound LANA, each corresponding to a single TR. From these data, we have generated a 3D model of the episomal half of the tether that integrates and extends previously established findings from epifluorescent, crystallographic, and epigenetic approaches. Our findings also validate the use of dSTORM in establishing novel structural insights into the physical basis of molecular connections linking host and pathogen genomes."
"We report the dynamic spatial organization ofCaulobacter crescentusRNase E (RNA degradosome) and ribosomal protein L1 (ribosome) using 3D single-particle tracking and superresolution microscopy. RNase E formed clusters along the central axis of the cell, while weak clusters of ribosomal protein L1 were deployed throughout the cytoplasm. These results contrast with RNase E and ribosome distribution inEscherichia coli, where RNase E colocalizes with the cytoplasmic membrane and ribosomes accumulate in polar nucleoid-free zones. For both RNase E and ribosomes inCaulobacter, we observed a decrease in confinement and clustering upon transcription inhibition and subsequent depletion of nascent RNA, suggesting that RNA substrate availability for processing, degradation, and translation facilitates confinement and clustering. Importantly, RNase E cluster positions correlated with the subcellular location of chromosomal loci of two highly transcribed rRNA genes, suggesting that RNase E's function in rRNA processing occurs at the site of rRNA synthesis. Thus, components of the RNA degradosome and ribosome assembly are spatiotemporally organized inCaulobacter, with chromosomal readout serving as the template for this organization."
"Reactive oxygen species formed within the mammalian cell can produce 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) in mRNA, which can cause base mispairing during gene expression. Here we found that administration of 8-oxoGTP in MTH1-knockdown cells results in increased 8-oxoG content in mRNA. Under this condition, an amber mutation of the reporter luciferase is suppressed. Using second-generation sequencing techniques, we found that U-to-G changes at preassigned sites of the luciferase transcript increased when 8-oxoGTP was supplied. In addition, an increased level of 8-oxoG content in RNA induced the accumulation of aggregable amyloid ? peptides in cells expressing amyloid precursor protein. Our findings indicate that 8-oxoG accumulation in mRNA can alter protein synthesis in mammalian cells. Further work is required to assess the significance of these findings under normal physiological conditions."
"Epidemics, flame propagation, and cardiac rhythms are classic examples of reaction-diffusion waves that describe a switch from one alternative state to another. Only two types of waves are known: pulled, driven by the leading edge, and pushed, driven by the bulk of the wave. Here, we report a distinct class of semipushed waves for which both the bulk and the leading edge contribute to the dynamics. These hybrid waves have the kinetics of pushed waves, but exhibit giant fluctuations similar to pulled waves. The transitions between pulled, semipushed, and fully pushed waves occur at universal ratios of the wave velocity to the Fisher velocity. We derive these results in the context of a species invading a new habitat by examining front diffusion, rate of diversity loss, and fluctuation-induced corrections to the expansion velocity. All three quantities decrease as a power law of the population density with the same exponent. We analytically calculate this exponent, taking into account the fluctuations in the shape of the wave front. For fully pushed waves, the exponent is -1, consistent with the central limit theorem. In semipushed waves, however, the fluctuations average out much more slowly, and the exponent approaches 0 toward the transition to pulled waves. As a result, a rapid loss of genetic diversity and large fluctuations in the position of the front occur, even for populations with cooperative growth and other forms of an Allee effect. The evolutionary outcome of spatial spreading in such populations could therefore be less predictable than previously thought."
"Host-associated microbiota help defend against bacterial pathogens; however, the mechanisms by which pathogens overcome this defense remain largely unknown. We developed a zebrafish model and used live imaging to directly study how the human pathogenVibrio choleraeinvades the intestine. The gut microbiota of fish monocolonized by symbiotic strainAeromonas veroniiwas displaced byV. choleraeexpressing its type VI secretion system (T6SS), a syringe-like apparatus that deploys effector proteins into target cells. Surprisingly, displacement was independent of T6SS-mediated killing ofA. veronii, driven instead by T6SS-induced enhancement of zebrafish intestinal movements that led to expulsion of the resident microbiota by the host. Deleting an actin cross-linking domain from the T6SS apparatus returned intestinal motility to normal and thwarted expulsion, without weakeningV. cholerae's ability to killA. veroniiin vitro. Our finding that bacteria can manipulate host physiology to influence intermicrobial competition has implications for both pathogenesis and microbiome engineering."
"The dispersal of modern humans from Africa is now well documented with genetic data that track population history, as well as gene flow between populations. Phenetic skeletal data, such as cranial and pelvic morphologies, also exhibit a dispersal-from-Africa signal, which, however, tends to be blurred by the effects of local adaptation and in vivo phenotypic plasticity, and that is often deteriorated by postmortem damage to skeletal remains. These complexities raise the question of which skeletal structures most effectively track neutral population history. The cavity system of the inner ear (the so-called bony labyrinth) is a good candidate structure for such analyses. It is already fully formed by birth, which minimizes postnatal phenotypic plasticity, and it is generally well preserved in archaeological samples. Here we use morphometric data of the bony labyrinth to show that it is a surprisingly good marker of the global dispersal of modern humans from Africa. Labyrinthine morphology tracks genetic distances and geography in accordance with an isolation-by-distance model with dispersal from Africa. Our data further indicate that the neutral-like pattern of variation is compatible with stabilizing selection on labyrinth morphology. Given the increasingly important role of the petrous bone for ancient DNA recovery from archaeological specimens, we encourage researchers to acquire 3D morphological data of the inner ear structures before any invasive sampling. Such data will constitute an important archive of phenotypic variation in present and past populations, and will permit individual-based genotype-phenotype comparisons."
"The fidelity of DNA replication is a critical factor in the rate at which cells incur mutations. Due to the antiparallel orientation of the two chromosomal DNA strands, one strand (leading strand) is replicated in a mostly processive manner, while the other (lagging strand) is synthesized in short sections called Okazaki fragments. A fundamental question that remains to be answered is whether the two strands are copied with the same intrinsic fidelity. In most experimental systems, this question is difficult to answer, as the replication complex contains a different DNA polymerase for each strand, such as, for example, DNA polymerases ? and ? in eukaryotes. Here we have investigated this question in the bacteriumEscherichia coli, in which the replicase (DNA polymerase III holoenzyme) contains two copies of the same polymerase (Pol III, thednaEgene product), and hence the two strands are copied by the same polymerase. Our in vivo mutagenesis data indicate that the two DNA strands are not copied with the same accuracy, and that, remarkably, the lagging strand has the highest fidelity. We postulate that this effect results from the greater dissociative character of the lagging-strand polymerase, which provides additional options for error removal. Our conclusion is strongly supported by results withdnaEantimutator polymerases characterized by increased dissociation rates."
"Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to genomic DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Mutations in TF binding sites are increasingly found to be associated with human disease, yet we currently lack robust methods to predict these sites. Here, we developed a versatile maximum likelihood framework named No Read Left Behind (NRLB) that infers a biophysical model of protein-DNA recognition across the full affinity range from a library of in vitro selected DNA binding sites. NRLB predicts human Max homodimer binding in near-perfect agreement with existing low-throughput measurements. It can capture the specificity of the p53 tetramer and distinguish multiple binding modes within a single sample. Additionally, we confirm that newly identified low-affinity enhancer binding sites are functional in vivo, and that their contribution to gene expression matches their predicted affinity. Our results establish a powerful paradigm for identifying protein binding sites and interpreting gene regulatory sequences in eukaryotic genomes."
"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder often associated with seizure that affects ?0.7% of pregnant women. During pregnancy, most epileptic patients are prescribed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as valproic acid (VPA) to control seizure activity. Here, we show that prenatal exposure to VPA in mice increases seizure susceptibility in adult offspring through mislocalization of newborn neurons in the hippocampus. We confirmed that neurons newly generated from neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) are integrated into the granular cell layer in the adult hippocampus; however, prenatal VPA treatment altered the expression in NS/PCs of genes associated with cell migration, includingCXC motif chemokine receptor 4(Cxcr4), consequently increasing the ectopic localization of newborn neurons in the hilus. We also found that voluntary exercise in a running wheel suppressed this ectopic neurogenesis and countered the enhanced seizure susceptibility caused by prenatal VPA exposure, probably by normalizing the VPA-disrupted expression of multiple genes includingCxcr4in adult NS/PCs. ReplenishingCxcr4expression alone in NS/PCs was sufficient to overcome the aberrant migration of newborn neurons and increased seizure susceptibility in VPA-exposed mice. Thus, prenatal exposure to an AED, VPA, has a long-term effect on the behavior of NS/PCs in offspring, but this effect can be counteracted by a simple physical activity. Our findings offer a step to developing strategies for managing detrimental effects in offspring exposed to VPA in utero."
"The influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion during viral entry in host cells. Blocking these key steps in viral infection has applications for development of novel antiinfluenza therapeutics as well as vaccines. However, the lack of structural information on how small molecules can gain a foothold in the small, shallow receptor-binding site (RBS) has hindered drug design against this important target on the viral pathogen. Here, we report on the serendipitous crystallization-based discovery of a small-moleculeN-cyclohexyltaurine, commonly known as the buffering agent CHES, that is able to bind to both group-1 and group-2 HAs of influenza A viruses. X-ray structural characterization of group-1 H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5/Viet) and group-2 H3N2 A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3/HK68) HAs at 2.0-Å and 2.57-Å resolution, respectively, revealed thatN-cyclohexyltaurine binds to the heart of the conserved HA RBS.N-cyclohexyltaurine mimics the binding mode of the natural receptor sialic acid and RBS-targeting bnAbs through formation of similar hydrogen bonds and CH-? interactions with the HA. In H3/HK68,N-cyclohexyltaurine also binds to a conserved pocket in the stem region, thereby exhibiting a dual-binding mode in group-2 HAs. These long-awaited structural insights into RBS recognition by a noncarbohydrate-based small molecule enhance our knowledge of how to target this important functional site and can serve as a template to guide the development of novel broad-spectrum small-molecule therapeutics against influenza virus."
"Humans are set apart from other organisms by the realization of their own mortality. Thus, determining the prehistoric emergence of this capacity is of significant interest to understanding the uniqueness of the human animal. Tracing that capacity chronologically is possible through archaeological investigations that focus on physical markers that reflect ""mortality salience."" Among these markers is the deliberate and culturally mediated disposal of corpses. Some Neandertal bone assemblages are among the earliest reasonable claims for the deliberate disposal of hominins, but even these are vigorously debated. More dramatic assertions center on the Middle Pleistocene sites of Sima de los Huesos (SH, Spain) and the Dinaledi Chamber (DC, South Africa), where the remains of multiple hominin individuals were found in deep caves, and under reported taphonomic circumstances that seem to discount the possibility that nonhominin actors and processes contributed to their formation. These claims, with significant implications for charting the evolution of the ""human condition,"" deserve scrutiny. We test these assertions through machine-learning analyses of hominin skeletal part representation in the SH and DC assemblages. Our results indicate that nonanthropogenic agents and abiotic processes cannot yet be ruled out as significant contributors to the ultimate condition of both collections. This finding does not falsify hypotheses of deliberate disposal for the SH and DC corpses, but does indicate that the data also support partially or completely nonanthropogenic formational histories."
"                    Borrelia burgdorferi
is one of the few extracellular pathogens capable of establishing persistent infection in mammals. The mechanisms that sustain long-term survival of this bacterium are largely unknown. Here we report a unique innate immune evasion strategy ofB. burgdorferi, orchestrated by a surface protein annotated as BBA57, through its modulation of multiple spirochete virulent determinants. BBA57 function is critical for early infection but largely redundant for later stages of spirochetal persistence, either in mammals or in ticks. The protein influences host IFN responses as well as suppresses multiple host microbicidal activities involving serum complement, neutrophils, and antimicrobial peptides. We also discovered a remarkable plasticity in BBA57-mediated spirochete immune evasion strategy because its loss, although resulting in near clearance of pathogens at the inoculum site, triggers nonheritable adaptive changes that exclude detectable nucleotide alterations in the genome but incorporate transcriptional reprograming events. Understanding the malleability in spirochetal immune evasion mechanisms that ensures their host persistence is critical for the development of novel therapeutic and preventive approaches to combat long-term infections like Lyme borreliosis."
"Endogenous circadian clocks control 24-h physiological and behavioral rhythms in mammals. Here, we report a real-time in vivo fluorescence recording system that enables long-term monitoring of circadian rhythms in the brains of freely moving mice. With a designed reporter of circadian clock gene expression, we tracked robustCry1transcription reporter rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of WT,Cry1

                    mice in LD (12 h light, 12 h dark) and DD (constant darkness) conditions and verified that signals remained stable for over 6 mo. Further, we recordedCry1transcriptional rhythms in the subparaventricular zone (SPZ) and hippocampal CA1/2 regions of WT mice housed under LD and DD conditions. By using a Cre-loxP system, we recordedPer2andCry1transcription rhythms specifically in vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons of the SCN. Finally, we demonstrated the dynamics ofPer2andCry1transcriptional rhythms in SCN VIP neurons following an 8-h phase advance in the light/dark cycle."
"It is widely acknowledged that faster-growing bacteria are killed faster by ?-lactam antibiotics. This notion serves as the foundation for the concept of bacterial persistence: dormant bacterial cells that do not grow are phenotypically tolerant against ?-lactam treatment. Such correlation has often been invoked in the mathematical modeling of bacterial responses to antibiotics. Due to the lack of thorough quantification, however, it is unclear whether and to what extent the bacterial growth rate can predict the lysis rate upon ?-lactam treatment under diverse conditions. Enabled by experimental automation, here we measured >1,000 growth/killing curves for eight combinations of antibiotics and bacterial species and strains, including clinical isolates of bacterial pathogens. We found that the lysis rate of a bacterial population linearly depends on the instantaneous growth rate of the population, regardless of how the latter is modulated. We further demonstrate that this predictive power at the population level can be explained by accounting for bacterial responses to the antibiotic treatment by single cells. This linear dependence of the lysis rate on the growth rate represents a dynamic signature associated with each bacterium-antibiotic pair and serves as the quantitative foundation for designing combination antibiotic therapy and predicting the population-structure change in a population with mixed phenotypes."
"The succession from aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria to obligate anaerobes in the infant gut along with the differences between the compositions of the mucosally adherent vs. luminal microbiota suggests that the gut microbes consume oxygen, which diffuses into the lumen from the intestinal tissue, maintaining the lumen in a deeply anaerobic state. Remarkably, measurements of luminal oxygen levels show nearly identical pO2(partial pressure of oxygen) profiles in conventional and germ-free mice, pointing to the existence of oxygen consumption mechanisms other than microbial respiration. In vitro experiments confirmed that the luminal contents of germ-free mice are able to chemically consume oxygen (e.g., via lipid oxidation reactions), although at rates significantly lower than those observed in the case of conventionally housed mice. For conventional mice, we also show that the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota adherent to the gut mucosa and in the lumen throughout the length of the gut correlates with oxygen levels. At the same time, an increase in the biomass of the gut microbiota provides an explanation for the reduction of luminal oxygen in the distal vs. proximal gut. These results demonstrate how oxygen from the mammalian host is used by the gut microbiota, while both the microbes and the oxidative chemical reactions regulate luminal oxygen levels, shaping the composition of the microbial community throughout different regions of the gut."
"The evolutionary emergence of humans' remarkably economical walking gait remains a focus of research and debate, but experimentally validated approaches linking locomotor capability to postcranial anatomy are limited. In this study, we integrated 3D morphometrics of hominoid pelvic shape with experimental measurements of hip kinematics and kinetics during walking and climbing, hamstring activity, and passive range of hip extension in humans, apes, and other primates to assess arboreal-terrestrial trade-offs in ischium morphology among living taxa. We show that hamstring-powered hip extension during habitual walking and climbing in living apes and humans is strongly predicted, and likely constrained, by the relative length and orientation of the ischium. Ape pelves permit greater extensor moments at the hip, enhancing climbing capability, but limit their range of hip extension, resulting in a crouched gait. Human pelves reduce hip extensor moments but permit a greater degree of hip extension, which greatly improves walking economy (i.e., distance traveled/energy consumed). Applying these results to fossil pelves suggests that early hominins differed from both humans and extant apes in having an economical walking gait without sacrificing climbing capability.Ardipithecuswas capable of nearly human-like hip extension during bipedal walking, but retained the capacity for powerful, ape-like hip extension during vertical climbing. Hip extension capability was essentially human-like inAustralopithecus afarensisandAustralopithecus africanus, suggesting an economical walking gait but reduced mechanical advantage for powered hip extension during climbing."
"Allelic loss of the autophagy gene,beclin 1/BECN1, increases the risk of patients developing aggressive, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, breast cancers; however, it is not known whether autophagy induction may be beneficial in preventing HER2-positive breast tumor growth. We explored the regulation of autophagy in breast cancer cells by HER2 in vitro and the effects of genetic and pharmacological strategies to increase autophagy on HER2-driven breast cancer growth in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that HER2 interacts with Beclin 1 in breast cancer cells and inhibits autophagy. Mice with increased basal autophagy due to a genetically engineered mutation inBecn1are protected from HER2-driven mammary tumorigenesis, and HER2 fails to inhibit autophagy in primary cells derived from these mice. Moreover, treatment of mice with HER2-positive human breast cancer xenografts with the Tat-Beclin 1 autophagy-inducing peptide inhibits tumor growth as effectively as a clinically used HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). This inhibition of tumor growth is associated with a robust induction of autophagy, a disruption of HER2/Beclin 1 binding, and a transcriptional signature in the tumors distinct from that observed with HER2 TKI treatment. Taken together, these findings indicate that the HER2-mediated inhibition of Beclin 1 and autophagy likely contributes to HER2-mediated tumorigenesis and that strategies to block HER2/Beclin 1 binding and/or increase autophagy may represent a new therapeutic approach for HER2-positive breast cancers."
"Inactivation of the retinoblastoma gene (RB1) product, pRB, is common in many human cancers. Targeting downstream effectors of pRB that are central to tumorigenesis is a promising strategy to block the growth of tumors harboring loss-of-functionRB1mutations. One such effector is retinoblastoma-binding protein 2 (RBP2, also called JARID1A or KDM5A), which encodes an H3K4 demethylase. Binding of pRB to RBP2 has been linked to the ability of pRB to promote senescence and differentiation. Importantly, genetic ablation of RBP2 is sufficient to phenocopy pRB's ability to induce these cellular changes in cell culture experiments. Moreover, germlineRbp2deletion significantly impedes tumorigenesis inRb1+/-mice. The value of RBP2 as a therapeutic target in cancer, however, hinges on whether loss of RBP2 could block the growth of established tumors as opposed to simply delaying their onset. Here we show that conditional, systemic ablation of RBP2 in tumor-bearingRb1+/-mice is sufficient to slow tumor growth and significantly extend survival without causing obvious toxicity to the host. These findings show that establishedRb1-null tumors require RBP2 for growth and further credential RBP2 as a therapeutic target in human cancers driven byRB1inactivation."
"Accurate evaluation of the effect of point mutations on protein function is essential to assessing the genesis and prognosis of many inherited diseases and cancer types. Currently, a wealth of computational tools has been developed for pathogenicity prediction. Two major types of data are used to this aim: sequence conservation/evolution and structural properties. Here, we demonstrate in a systematic way that another determinant of the functional impact of missense variants is the protein's structural dynamics. Measurable improvement is shown in pathogenicity prediction by taking into consideration the dynamical context and implications of the mutation. Our study suggests that the class of dynamics descriptors introduced here may be used in conjunction with existing features to not only increase the prediction accuracy of the impact of variants on biological function, but also gain insight into the physical basis of the effect of missense variants."
"Expansions of simple sequence repeats, or microsatellites, have been linked to ?30 neurological-neuromuscular diseases. While these expansions occur in coding and noncoding regions, microsatellite sequence and repeat length diversity is more prominent in introns with eight different trinucleotide to hexanucleotide repeats, causing hereditary diseases such as myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), andC9orf72amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). Here, we test the hypothesis that these GC-rich intronic microsatellite expansions selectively trigger host intron retention (IR). Using DM2, FECD, and C9-ALS/FTD as examples, we demonstrate that retention is readily detectable in affected tissues and peripheral blood lymphocytes and conclude that IR screening constitutes a rapid and inexpensive biomarker for intronic repeat expansion disease."
"Sterile alpha motif and HD-domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) blocks replication of retroviruses and certain DNA viruses by reducing the intracellular dNTP pool. SAMHD1 has been suggested to down-regulate IFN and inflammatory responses to viral infections, although the functions and mechanisms of SAMHD1 in modulating innate immunity remain unclear. Here, we show that SAMHD1 suppresses the innate immune responses to viral infections and inflammatory stimuli by inhibiting nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) activation and type I interferon (IFN-I) induction. Compared with control cells, infection of SAMHD1-silenced human monocytic cells or primary macrophages with Sendai virus (SeV) or HIV-1, or treatment with inflammatory stimuli, induces significantly higher levels of NF-?B activation and IFN-I induction. Exogenous SAMHD1 expression in cells or SAMHD1 reconstitution in knockout cells suppresses NF-?B activation and IFN-I induction by SeV infection or inflammatory stimuli. Mechanistically, SAMHD1 inhibits NF-?B activation by interacting with NF-?B1/2 and reducing phosphorylation of the NF-?B inhibitory protein I?B?. SAMHD1 also interacts with the inhibitor-?B kinase ? (IKK?) and IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), leading to the suppression of the IFN-I induction pathway by reducing IKK?-mediated IRF7 phosphorylation. Interactions of endogenous SAMHD1 with NF-?B and IFN-I pathway proteins were validated in human monocytic cells and primary macrophages. Comparing splenocytes fromSAMHD1knockout and heterozygous mice, we further confirmed SAMHD1-mediated suppression of NF-?B activation, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved property of SAMHD1. Our findings reveal functions of SAMHD1 in down-regulating innate immune responses to viral infections and inflammatory stimuli, highlighting the importance of SAMHD1 in modulating antiviral immunity."
"Predicting how increasing atmospheric CO2will affect the hydrologic cycle is of utmost importance for a range of applications ranging from ecological services to human life and activities. A typical perspective is that hydrologic change is driven by precipitation and radiation changes due to climate change, and that the land surface will adjust. Using Earth system models with decoupled surface (vegetation physiology) and atmospheric (radiative) CO2responses, we here show that the CO2physiological response has a dominant role in evapotranspiration and evaporative fraction changes and has a major effect on long-term runoff compared with radiative or precipitation changes due to increased atmospheric CO2This major effect is true for most hydrological stress variables over the largest fraction of the globe, except for soil moisture, which exhibits a more nonlinear response. This highlights the key role of vegetation in controlling future terrestrial hydrologic response and emphasizes that the carbon and water cycles are intimately coupled over land."
"The cell adhesion glycoprotein E-cadherin (CDH1) is commonly inactivated in breast tumors. Precision medicine approaches that exploit this characteristic are not available. Using perturbation screens in breast tumor cells with CRISPR/Cas9-engineeredCDH1mutations, we identified synthetic lethality between E-cadherin deficiency and inhibition of the tyrosine kinase ROS1. Data from large-scale genetic screens in molecularly diverse breast tumor cell lines established that the E-cadherin/ROS1 synthetic lethality was not only robust in the face of considerable molecular heterogeneity but was also elicited with clinical ROS1 inhibitors, including foretinib and crizotinib. ROS1 inhibitors induced mitotic abnormalities and multinucleation in E-cadherin-defective cells, phenotypes associated with a defect in cytokinesis and aberrant p120 catenin phosphorylation and localization.In vivo, ROS1 inhibitors produced profound antitumor effects in multiple models of E-cadherin-defective breast cancer. These data therefore provide the preclinical rationale for assessing ROS1 inhibitors, such as the licensed drug crizotinib, in appropriately stratified patients.Significance:E-cadherin defects are common in breast cancer but are currently not targeted with a precision medicine approach. Our preclinical data indicate that licensed ROS1 inhibitors, including crizotinib, should be repurposed to target E-cadherin-defective breast cancers, thus providing the rationale for the assessment of these agents in molecularly stratified phase II clinical trials.Cancer Discov; 8(4); 498-515. ©2018 AACR.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 371."
"Cell division of rod-shaped bacteria requires the Z ring, a ring of FtsZ filaments associated with the inner-membrane wall. The MinCDE proteins help localize the Z ring to the center of theEscherichia colicell. MinC, which inhibits Z-ring assembly, is a passenger on MinD. Previous studies have shown that MinC-MinD fromE. coliandAquifex aeolicusassemblein vitrointo extended filaments with a 1:1 stoichiometry. However, a recent study has raised questions about the function of the MinC-MinD copolymerin vivo, since its assembly appears to require a high concentration of these two proteins, has a long lag time, and its blockade does not affectin vivoactivities. Here, we found that MinC and MinD fromPseudomonas aeruginosacoassemble into filaments with a 1:1 stoichiometry. We also found that the minimal concentration of ~4 ?M required for assembly applies only to MinD because above 4 ?M MinD, even very low MinC concentrations sustained coassembly. As previously reported, the MinC-MinD coassembly exhibited a long lag of ~100 s when initiated by ATP. Premixing MinD with ATP eliminated this lag, suggesting that it may be due to slow MinD dimerization following ATP activation. We also discovered that MinC-MinD copolymers quickly bound and formed huge bundles with FtsZ filaments. Our results resolve previous questions about the low concentration of MinC and the lag time, insights that may inform future investigations into the exact role of the MinC-MinD copolymerin vivo."
"G protein-coupled receptors that signal through G?q (Gq receptors), such as ?1-adrenergic receptors (?1-ARs) or angiotensin receptors, share a common proximal signaling pathway that activates phospholipase C?1 (PLC?1), which cleaves phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. Despite these common proximal signaling mechanisms, Gq receptors produce distinct physiological responses, yet the mechanistic basis for this remains unclear. In the heart, Gq receptors are thought to induce myocyte hypertrophy through a mechanism termed excitation-transcription coupling, which provides a mechanistic basis for compartmentalization of calcium required for contraction versus IP3-dependent intranuclear calcium required for hypertrophy. Here, we identified subcellular compartmentalization of Gq-receptor signaling as a mechanistic basis for unique Gq receptor-induced hypertrophic phenotypes in cardiac myocytes. We show that ?1-adrenergic receptors (?1-ARs) co-localize with PLC?1 and PIP2 at the nuclear membrane. Further, nuclear ?1-ARs induced intranuclear PLC?1 activity, leading to histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) export and a robust transcriptional response, i.e. significant up- or down-regulation of 806 genes. Conversely, we found that angiotensin receptors localize to the sarcolemma and induce sarcolemmal PLC?1 activity, but fail to promote HDAC5 nuclear export, while producing a transcriptional response that is mostly a subset of ?1-AR-induced transcription. In summary, these results link Gq-receptor compartmentalization in cardiac myocytes to unique hypertrophic transcription. They suggest a new model of excitation-transcription coupling in adult cardiac myocytes that accounts for differential Gq-receptor localization and better explains distinct physiological functions of Gq receptors."
"Periodontal diseases are among the most prevalent worldwide, but largely silent, chronic diseases. They affect the tooth-supporting tissues with multiple ramifications on life quality. Their early diagnosis is still challenging, due to lack of appropriate molecular diagnostic methods. Saliva offers a non-invasively collectable reservoir of clinically relevant biomarkers, which, if utilized efficiently, could facilitate early diagnosis and monitoring of ongoing disease. Despite several novel protein markers being recently enlisted by discovery proteomics, their routine diagnostic application is hampered by the lack of validation platforms that allow for rapid, accurate and simultaneous quantification of multiple proteins in large cohorts. We carried out a pipeline of two proteomic platforms; firstly, we applied open ended label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics for discovery in saliva (n=67, health, gingivitis, and periodontitis), followed by selected-reaction monitoring (SRM)-targeted proteomics for validation in an independent cohort (n=82). The LFQ platform led to the discovery of 119 proteins with at least two-fold significant difference between health and disease. The 65 proteins chosen for the subsequent SRM platform included 50 related proteins derived from the significantly enriched processes of the LFQ data, 11 from literature-mining, and four house-keeping ones. Among those, 60 were reproducibly quantifiable proteins (92% success rate), represented by a total of 143 peptides. Machine-learning modeling led to a narrowed-down panel of five proteins of high predictive value for periodontal diseases (higher in disease: Matrix metalloproteinase-9, Ras-related protein-1, Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 5; lower in disease: Clusterin, Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumors 1), with maximum area under the receiver operating curve >0.97. This panel enriches the pool of credible clinical biomarker candidates for diagnostic assay development. Yet, the quantum leap brought in periodontal diagnostics by this study lies in the introduction of the well established discovery-through-verification pipeline for periodontal biomarker discovery and validation in further periodontal patient cohorts."
"Diabetic pregnancy is correlated with increased risk of metabolic and neurological disorders in the offspring putatively mediated epigenetically. Little is known about epigenetic changes already present in fetuses of diabetic pregnancies. We aimed at characterizing the perinatal environment after preexisting maternal diabetes mellitus and at identifying relevant epigenetic changes in the fetus. We focused on the transcription factorSrebf2(sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2), a master gene in regulation of cholesterol metabolism. We tested whether diabetic pregnancy induces epigenetic changes in theSrebf2promoter and if they become manifest in alteredSrebf2gene expression. We worked with a transgenic rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Tet29) in which the insulin receptor is knocked down by doxycycline-induced RNA interference. Doxycycline was administered preconceptionally to Tet29 and wild-type control rats. Only Tet29 doxycycline dams were hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, and hyperlipidemic. Gene expression was analyzed with quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and CpG promoter methylation with pyrosequencing. Immunohistochemistry was performed on fetal brains. Fetuses from diabetic Tet29 dams were hyperglycemic and growth restricted at the end of pregnancy. They further displayed decreased liver and brain weight with concomitant decreased microglial activation in the hippocampus in comparison to fetuses of normoglycemic mothers. Importantly, diabetic pregnancy induced CpG hypermethylation of theSrebf2promoter in the fetal liver and brain, which was associated with decreasedSrebf2gene expression. In conclusion, diabetic and hyperlipidemic pregnancy induces neurological, metabolic, and epigenetic alterations in the rat fetus.Srebf2is a potential candidate mediating intrauterine environment-driven epigenetic changes and later diabetic offspring health."
"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is implicated in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. An association between anEDN1gene polymorphism with high ET-1 and preeclampsia was reported in humans, but their cause and effect relationships have not been defined. We examined the pregnancy effects in mice with a modifiedEdn1allele that increases mRNA stability and thus ET-1 production. HeterozygousEdn1
                        H/+
                    females showed no obvious abnormalities before pregnancy, but when mated with wild-type (WT) males developed a full spectrum of preeclampsia-like phenotypes, including increased systolic blood pressure, proteinuria, glomerular endotheliosis, and intrauterine fetal growth restriction. At 7.5 days post-coitus, the embryos fromEdn1
                        H/+
                    dams, regardless of theirEdn1genotype, lagged 12 hours in development compared with embryos from WT dams, had disoriented ectoplacental cones, and retained high E-cadherin expression. In contrast, WT females mated withEdn1
                        H/+
                    males, which also carried half of the fetuses withEdn1
                        H/+
                    genotype, showed a mild systolic blood pressure increase only. These WT dams had 2× higher plasma soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 than WT dams mated with WT males. In human first trimester trophoblast cells, pharmacological doses of ET-1 increased the cellularsFlt1transcripts and protein secretion via both type A and B ET-1 receptors. Our data demonstrate that high maternal ET-1 production causes preeclampsia-like phenotypes during pregnancy, affecting both initial stage of trophoblast differentiation/invasion and maternal peripheral vasculature during late gestation. High fetal ET-1 production, however, could cause increased soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 in the maternal circulation and contribute to blood pressure elevation."
"                    Leishmania donovani
(L. donovani) is a causative pathogen of potentially-fatal visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Therapeutic agents are available; however, their use is limited due to high cost, serious side effects, and development of antimicrobial resistance. Protective immunity against VL depends on CD4+Th1 cell-mediated immunity. Studies have shown that progression of VL is due to exhaustion of T cells; however, the mechanism involved is not clearly understood. Here, we examined the role of PD1/PDL-1 in the pathogenesis of VL using murine model of VL. Our data indicated thatL. donovaniis able to elicit initial expansion of IFN-? producing CD4+Th1 and CD8+T cells at day 7 post infection (p.i.); however, the frequency of those cells and inflammatory response decreased at day 21 p.i., despite persistence of parasites. Persistent infection induced expansion of IL-10+FOXP3+Treg and CD4+and CD8+T cells expressing PD1. Blocking PDL-1 signalingin vivoresulted in restoration of protective type 1 responses by both CD4+and CD8+T cells, which resulted in a significant decrease in the parasitic burden. Mechanistically, PDL-1 blocking inhibited autophagy, a cellular degradation process hijacked byLeishmaniato acquire host cell nutrients for their survival. Inhibition of autophagy was marked by decreased lipidation of microtubule-associated-protein-1-Light Chain 3 (LC3), marker of autophagsome formation, and P62 accumulation. Together, our study shows for the first time that anti-PDL-1 is an effective therapeutic approach for restoration of effector arms of protective immunity against VL and subsequent parasite clearance."
"Satellite DNAs are simple tandem repeats that exist at centromeric and pericentromeric regions on eukaryotic chromosomes. Unlike the centromeric satellite DNA that comprises the vast majority of natural centromeres, function(s) for the much more abundant pericentromeric satellite repeats are poorly understood. In fact, the lack of coding potential allied with rapid divergence of repeat sequences across eukaryotes has led to their dismissal as ""junk DNA"" or ""selfish parasites."" Although implicated in various biological processes, a conserved function for pericentromeric satellite DNA remains unidentified. We have addressed the role of satellite DNA through studying chromocenters, a cytological aggregation of pericentromeric satellite DNA from multiple chromosomes into DNA-dense nuclear foci. We have shown that multivalent satellite DNA-binding proteins cross-link pericentromeric satellite DNA on chromosomes into chromocenters. Disruption of chromocenters results in the formation of micronuclei, which arise by budding off the nucleus during interphase. We propose a model that satellite DNAs are critical chromosome elements that are recognized by satellite DNA-binding proteins and incorporated into chromocenters. We suggest that chromocenters function to preserve the entire chromosomal complement in a single nucleus, a fundamental and unquestioned feature of eukaryotic genomes. We speculate that the rapid divergence of satellite DNA sequences between closely related species results in discordant chromocenter function and may underlie speciation and hybrid incompatibility."
"Panicle size is a critical determinant of grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa) and other grain crops. During rice growth and development, spikelet abortion often occurs at either the top or the basal part of the panicle under unfavorable conditions, causing a reduction in fertile spikelet number and thus grain yield. In this study, we report the isolation and functional characterization of a panicle abortion mutant named panicle apical abortion1-1 (paab1-1). paab1-1 exhibits degeneration of spikelets on the apical portion of panicles during late stage of panicle development. Cellular and physiological analyses revealed that the apical spikelets in the paab1-1 mutant undergo programmed cell death (PCD), accompanied by nuclear DNA fragmentation and accumulation of higher levels of H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA). Molecular cloning revealed that paab1-1 harbors a mutation in OsALMT7, which encodes a putative aluminum-activated malate transporter (OsALMT7) localized to the plasma membrane, and is preferentially expressed in the vascular tissues of developing panicles. Consistent with a function for OsALMT7 as a malate transporter, the panicle of the paab1-1 mutant contained less malate than wild type, particularly at the apical portions, and injection of malate into the paab1-1 panicle could alleviate the spikelet degeneration phenotype. Together, these results suggest that OsALMT7-mediated transport of malate into the apical portion of panicle is required for normal panicle development, thus highlighting a key role of malate in maintaining the sink size and grain yield in rice, and probably other grain crops."
"The imipenem-relebactam combination is in development as a potential treatment regimen for infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae possessing complex ?-lactamase backgrounds. Relebactam is a ?-lactamase inhibitor that possesses the diazabicyclooctane core similar to avibactam, however relebactam's R1 side chain also includes a piperidine ring compared to the carboxyamide of avibactam. Here, we investigated the inactivation ofKlebsiella pneumoniaecarbapenemase (KPC-2), the most widespread class A carbapenemase, by relebactam and performed susceptibility testing with imipenem-relebactam using KPC-producing clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements using agar dilution methods revealed that all 101 clinical isolates of KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae (K. pneumoniae,Klebsiellaoxytoca,Enterobacter cloacae,Enterobacteraerogenes,Citrobacter freundii,Citrobacter koseri, andEscherichia coli) were highly susceptible to imipenem-relebactam (MICs ? 2 mg/L). Relebactam inhibited KPC-2 with ak2/Kvalue of 24,750 M-1s-1and demonstrated a slowkoffof 0.0002 s-1Biochemical analysis using time-based mass spectrometry to map intermediates revealed that the KPC-2-relebactam acyl-enzyme complex was stable for up to 24 hours. Importantly, desulfation of relebactam was not observed using mass spectrometry. Desulfation and subsequent deacylation has been observed during the reaction of KPC-2 with avibactam. Upon molecular dynamics simulations of relebactam in the KPC-2 active site, we found that in comparison to the KPC-2-avibactam, the positioning of active site water molecules is less favorable for desulfation. In the acyl-complexes, the water molecules are within 2.5-3 Å of the avibactam sulfate, however more than 5-6 Å from the relebactam sulfate. As a result, we propose that the KPC-2-relebactam acyl-complex is more stable than the KPC-2-avibactam acyl-enzyme complex. The clinical implications of this difference are not currently known."
"The obligate intracellular bacteriumChlamydiais a widespread human pathogen that causes serious problems including (but not limited to) infertility and blindness. Our search for novel antichlamydial metabolites from marine-derived microorganisms led to isolation of pyocyanin, a small compound fromPseudomonas aeruginosaPyocyanin is an effective antichlamydial for all threeChlamydiaspp. tested. It has an IC50of 0.019 ? 0.028 ?M, which is comparable to the IC50of tetracycline. At concentrations as low as 0.0039 ?M, pyocyanin disables infectivity of the chlamydial elementary body (EB). At 0.5 ?M or higher concentrations, continuous presence of pyocyanin also inhibits chlamydial growth in the inclusion during later stages of the developmental cycle. Oxidative stress, a major known antimicrobial mechanism of pyocyanin, appears to be responsible for only the inhibition of bacterial growth but not the disinfection of EBs. Pyocyanin is well-tolerated by probiotic vaginalLactobacillusspp. Our findings suggest that pyocyanin is of therapeutic value for chlamydial infections, and can serve as a valuable chemical probe for studying chlamydial biology."
"The antifungal drug 5-flucytosine (5FC), a derivative of the nucleobase cytosine, is licenced for treatment of fungal diseases however it is rarely used as a monotherapeutic to treatAspergillusinfection. Despite being potent against other fungal pathogens, 5FC has limited activity againstA. fumigatuswhen standardin vitroassays are used to determine susceptibility. However, in modifiedin vitroassays where the pH is set to pH 5 the activity of 5FC increases significantly.Here we provide evidence thatfcyB, a gene that encodes a purine-cytosine permease orthologous to known 5FC importers is downregulated at pH 7 and is the primary factor responsible for the low efficacy of 5FC at pH 7. We also uncover two transcriptional regulators that are responsible for repression offcyBand consequently mediators of 5FC resistance, the CCAAT binding complex (CBC) and the pH regulatory protein PacC. We propose that the activity of 5FC might be enhanced by perturbation of factors that repressfcyBexpression such as PacC or other components of the pH sensing machinery."
"This study aims to investigate whether the addition of fosfomycin or cloxacillin to daptomycin provides better outcomes in the treatment of methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA) experimental aortic endocarditis in rabbits. Five MRSA strains were used to performin vitrotime-kill studies at standard (105) and high (108) inocula. Combined therapy was compared with daptomycin monotherapy treatment in the MRSA experimental endocarditis model. A human-like pharmacokinetics model was applied and the equivalents of cloxacillin 2g/4hiv, fosfomycin 2g/6h iv and daptomycin 6-10mg/kg/d iv were administered. The combination of daptomycin and fosfomycin or cloxacillin was synergistic in the five strains tested at both inocula. A bactericidal effect was detected in four out of five strains tested with both combinations. The MRSA-277 strain (vancomycin MIC, 2 mcg/mL) was used for the experimental endocarditis model. Daptomycin plus fosfomycin significantly improved the efficacy of daptomycin monotherapy at 6 mg/kg/d in terms of both the proportion of sterile vegetations (100% vs. 72%,P=.046) and the decrease in the density of bacteria within the vegetations (P=.025). Daptomycin plus fosfomycin was as effective as daptomycin monotherapy at 10 mg/kg/d (100% vs. 93%,P=1.00) and had similar activity to daptomycin plus cloxacillin when daptomycin was administered at 6 mg/kg/d (100% vs. 88%,P=0.48). Daptomycin non-susceptibility was not detected in any of the isolates recovered from vegetations. In conclusion, for the treatment of MRSA experimental endocarditis, the combination of daptomycin plus fosfomycin showed synergistic and bactericidal activity."
"Translation is a key step in the regulation of gene expression and one of the most energy consuming processes in the cell. In response to various stimuli, multiple signaling pathways converge on the translational machinery to regulate its function. To date, the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in the regulation of translation is among the best understood. Both pathways engage the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) to regulate a variety of components of the translational machinery. While these pathways regulate protein synthesis in homeostasis, their dysregulation results in aberrant translation leading to human diseases, including diabetes, neurological disorders and cancer. Herein, we review the role of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways in the regulation of mRNA translation. We also highlight additional signaling mechanisms that have recently emerged as regulators of the translational apparatus."
"The guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Son-of-Sevenless (SOS) plays a critical role in metazoan signaling by converting RasGDP (guanosine diphosphate) to RasGTP (guanosine triphosphate) in response to tyrosine kinase activation. Structural studies have shown that SOS differs from other Ras-specific GEFs in that SOS is itself activated by RasGTP binding to an allosteric site, distal to the site of nucleotide exchange. The activation of SOS involves membrane recruitment and conformational changes, triggered by lipid binding, that open the allosteric binding site for RasGTP. This is in contrast to other Ras-specific GEFs, which are activated by second messengers that more directly affect the active site. Allosteric RasGTP binding stabilizes SOS at the membrane, where it can turn over other Ras molecules processively, leading to an ultrasensitive response that is distinct from that of other Ras-specific GEFs."
"Upon recognition of a microbial pathogen, the innate and adaptive immune systems are linked to generate a cell-mediated immune response against the foreign invader. The culture filtrate ofMycobacterium tuberculosiscontains ligands, such asM. tuberculosistRNA, that activate the innate immune response and secreted Ags recognized by T cells to drive adaptive immune responses. In this study, bioinformatics analysis of gene-expression profiles derived from human PBMCs treated with distinct microbial ligands identified a mycobacterial tRNA-induced innate immune network resulting in the robust production of IL-12p70, a cytokine required to instruct an adaptive Th1 response for host defense against intracellular bacteria. As validated by functional studies, this pathway contained a feed-forward loop, whereby the early production of IL-18, type I IFNs, and IL-12p70 primed NK cells to respond to IL-18 and produce IFN-?, enhancing further production of IL-12p70. Mechanistically, tRNA activates TLR3 and TLR8, and this synergistic induction of IL-12p70 was recapitulated by the addition of a specific TLR8 agonist with a TLR3 ligand to PBMCs. These data indicate thatM. tuberculosistRNA activates a gene network involving the integration of multiple innate signals, including types I and II IFNs, as well as distinct cell types to induce IL-12p70."
"In this review, we highlight the current understanding of translation elongation and recoding in eukaryotes. In addition to providing an overview of the process, recent advances in our understanding of the role of the factor eIF5A in both translation elongation and termination are discussed. We also highlight mechanisms of translation recoding with a focus on ribosomal frameshifting during elongation. We see that the balance between the basic steps in elongation and the less common recoding events is determined by the kinetics of the different processes as well as by specific sequence determinants."
"Fish sperm cryopreservation is a well-established technique allowing for artificial insemination on a commercial scale. The extent of proteome alterations in seminal plasma and sperm due to cryopreservation, however, is not known. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of cryopreservation on motility variables of sterlet Acipenser ruthenus sperm and to detect the differences in protein profiles of fresh and cryopreserved sterlet sperm and seminal plasma. Fresh sperm had 89?±?3% motility and 160?±?14??m/s curvilinear velocity at 15?s post-activation. The motility rate of cryopreserved sperm (37?±?5%) was less at 15?s post-activation. No difference (ANOVA; P?>?0.05) in mean curvilinear velocity of fresh and cryopreserved sperm was detected. The protein profiles of seminal plasma and sperm were characterized using comparative proteomics to determine the influence of cryopreservation. Six altered protein spots in seminal plasma and thirteen altered spots in sperm were detected in fresh and thawed sperm. Subsequent protein characterization suggested that the proteins identified were involved in sperm metabolism, cytoskeleton, and stress response. The results broaden the understanding of the effects of cryopreservation and identify the proteins associated with cryo-injury. These data may help to determine the function of altered proteins and provide new insights into improving sperm cryopreservation."
"In this study, we attempted to detect Rickettsia, Coxiella and Anaplasma bacteria in one hundred and fourteen-Dermacentor and thirty three-Amblyomma unfed adult ticks that were collected from under leaves along animal trails at different places across Thailand. PCR amplification was used to identify bacterial infection with general conserved sequences of bacteria. The results revealed single infection in Amblyomma testudinarium ticks with Rickettsia (24%) and Coxiella (6%). Anaplasma bacteria were often detected in Dermacentor auratus ticks (32%). Coxiella spp. were detected in Dermacentor atrosignatus (6%) and D. auratus ticks (3%) in this study. Moreover, we found co-infection by Coxiella and Rickettsia bacteria (39%) in Am. testudinarium. In contrast, D. atrosignatus ticks were co-infected with Coxiella and Anaplasma bacteria (3%) and Dermacentor compactus ticks were co-infected with Rickettsia and Anaplasma spp. (25%). Interestingly, Am. testudinarium ticks (12%) were found for the first time to exhibit triple infection by these three bacteria. Phylogenetic studies showed the rickettsiae from ticks causing both single and multiple infections had sequence similarity with spotted fever group rickettsial strains, including Rickettsia massilliae, R. raoultii and R. tamurae. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene of Coxiella bacteria showed that they were closely grouped with Coxiella endosymbionts in both Dermacentor and Amblyomma. Moreover, the Anaplasma identified in a D. auratus tick was grouped in the same clade with the pathogenic bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Bacterial co-infections in Dermacentor and Amblyomma ticks may cause co-transmission of some tick-borne microorganisms (pathogen and endosymbiont, whether enhance or reduce) in humans and animals and they could affect medical and veterinary health."
"Increasing numbers of women are being identified at 'high-risk' of breast cancer, defined by The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as a 10-year risk of ?8%. Classically women have been so identified through family history based risk algorithms or genetic testing of high-risk genes. Recent research has shown that assessment of mammographic density and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), when combined with established risk factors, trebles the number of women reaching the high risk threshold. The options for risk reduction in such women include endocrine chemoprevention with the selective estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen and raloxifene or the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole or exemestane. NICE recommends offering anastrozole to postmenopausal women at high-risk of breast cancer as cost effectiveness analysis showed this to be cost saving to the National Health Service. Overall uptake to chemoprevention has been disappointingly low but this may improve with the improved efficacy of aromatase inhibitors, particularly the lack of toxicity to the endometrium and thrombogenic risks. Novel approaches to chemoprevention under investigation include lower dose and topical tamoxifen, denosumab, anti-progestins and metformin. Although oophorectomy is usually only recommended to women at increased risk of ovarian cancer it has been shown in numerous studies to reduce breast cancer risks in the general population and in those with mutations in BRCA1/2. However, recent evidence from studies that have confined analysis to true prospective follow up have cast doubt on the efficacy of oophorectomy to reduce breast cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers, at least in the short-term."
"We previously reported an interim analysis of the DADI (dasatinib discontinuation) trial. The results showed that 48% of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase who maintained a deep molecular response (DMR) for ? 1 year could discontinue second- or subsequent-line dasatinib treatment safely at a median follow-up of 20 months. However, the results from longer follow-up periods would be much more useful from a clinical perspective.The DADI trial was a prospective, multicenter trial conducted in Japan. After confirming a stable DMR for ? 1 year, dasatinib treatment subsequent to imatinib or nilotinib was discontinued. After discontinuation, the loss of DMR (even of 1 point) was defined as stringent molecular relapse, thereby triggering therapy resumption. The predictive factors of treatment-free remission (TFR) were analyzed.The median follow-up period was 44.0 months (interquartile range, 40.5-48.0 months). The estimated overall TFR rate at 36 months was 44.4% (95% confidence interval, 32.0%-56.2%). Only 2 patients developed a molecular relapse after the 1-year cutoff point. The presence of imatinib resistance was a significant risk factor for molecular relapse. Moreover, high natural killer cell and low ??+T-cell and CD4+regulatory T-cell (CD25+CD127low) counts before discontinuation correlated significantly with successful therapy discontinuation.These findings suggest that discontinuation of second- or subsequent-line dasatinib after a sustained DMR of ? 1 year is feasible, especially for patients with no history of imatinib resistance. In addition, the natural killer cell count was associated with the TFR."
