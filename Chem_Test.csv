"The challenges facing the rapid developments of highly integrated electronics, photonics, and microelectromechanical systems suggest that effective fabrication technologies are urgently needed to produce ordered structures using components with high performance potential. Inspired by the spontaneous organization of molecular units into ordered structures by noncovalent interactions, we succeed for the first time in synthesizing a two-dimensional superordered structure (2DSOS). As demonstrated by graphene, the 2DSOS was prepared via self-assembly of high-quality graphene single crystals under mutual electrostatic force between the adjacent crystals assisted by airflow-induced hydrodynamic forces at the liquid metal surface. The as-obtained 2DSOS exhibits tunable periodicity in the crystal space and outstanding uniformity in size and orientation. Moreover, the intrinsic property of each building block is preserved. With simplicity, scalability, and continuously adjustable feature size, the presented approach may open new territory for the precise assembly of 2D atomic crystals and facilitate its application in structurally derived integrated systems."
"A major goal of energy research is to use visible light to cleave water directly, without an applied voltage, into hydrogen and oxygen. Although SrTiO3 requires ultraviolet light, after four decades, it is still the \xe2\x80\x9cgold standard\xe2\x80\x9d for the photo-catalytic splitting of water. It is chemically robust and can carry out both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions without an applied bias. While ultrahigh vacuum surface science techniques have provided useful insights, we still know relatively little about the structure of these electrodes in contact with electrolytes under operating conditions. Here, we report the surface structure evolution of a n-SrTiO3 electrode during water splitting, before and after \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d with an applied positive bias. Operando high-energy X-ray reflectivity measurements demonstrate that training the electrode irreversibly reorders the surface. Scanning electrochemical microscopy at open circuit correlates this training with a 3-fold increase of the activity toward the photo-induced water splitting. A novel first-principles joint density functional theory simulation, constrained to the X-ray data via a generalized penalty function, identifies an anatase-like structure as the more active, trained surface."
"The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO is a reaction of central importance for sustainable energy conversion and storage. Herein, structure\xe2\x80\x93activity relationships of a series of imidazolium-based cocatalysts for this reaction are described, which demonstrate that the C4- and C5-protons on the imidazolium ring are vital for efficient catalysis. Further investigation of these findings led to the discovery of new imidazolium salts, which show superior activity as cocatalysts for the reaction, i.e., CO is selectively produced at significantly lower overpotentials with nearly quantitative faradaic yields for CO."
Nickel-catalyzed enantioselective cross-couplings between symmetric cyclic sulfates and aromatic Grignard reagents are described. These reactions are effective with a broad range of substituted cyclic sulfates and deliver products with asymmetric tertiary carbon centers. Mechanistic experiments point to a stereoinvertive SN2-like oxidative addition of a nickel complex to the electrophilic substrate.
"Using recently developed full-dimensional coupled quasi-diabatic ab initio potential energy surfaces including four electronic (1\xcf\x80\xcf\x80, 1\xcf\x80\xcf\x80*, 11\xcf\x80\xcf\x83*, and 21\xcf\x80\xcf\x83*) states, the tunneling dynamics of phenol photodissociation via its first excited singlet state (S1 \xe2\x86\x90 S0) is investigated quantum mechanically using a three-dimensional model. The lifetimes of several low-lying vibrational states are examined and compared with experiment. The deuteration of the phenoxyl hydrogen is found to dramatically increase the lifetime, attesting to the tunneling nature of the nonadiabatic dissociation. Importantly, it is shown that owing to the conical intersection topography tunneling in this system cannot be described in the standard adiabatic approximation, which eschews the geometric phase effect since the nonadiabatically computed lifetimes, validated by comparison with experiment, differ significantly from those obtained in that limit."
"We report here experiments showing that the hexadehydro-Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder (HDDA) cycloisomerization reaction proceeds in a stepwise manner\xe2\x80\x94i.e., via a diradical intermediate. Judicious use of substituent effects was decisive. We prepared (i) a series of triyne HDDA substrates that differed only in the R group present on the remote terminus of the diynophilic alkyne and (ii) an analogous series of dienophilic alkynes (n-C7H15COC\xe2\x89\xa1CR) for use in classical Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder (DA) reactions (with 1,3-cyclopentadiene). The R groups were CF3, CHO, COMe/Et, CO2Me, CONMe2/Et2, H, and 1-propynyl. The relative rates of both the HDDA cyclization reactions and the simple DA cycloadditions were measured. The reactivity trends revealed a dramatic difference in the behaviors of the CF3 (slowest HDDA and nearly fastest DA) and 1-propynyl (fastest HDDA and slowest DA) containing members of each series. These differences can be explained by invoking radical-stabilizing energies rather than electron-withdrawing effects as the dominating feature of the HDDA reaction."
"Constructing small molecule systems that mimic the functionality exhibited in biological reaction networks is a key objective of systems chemistry. Herein, we report the development of a dynamic catalytic system where the catalyst activity is modulated through a dynamic covalent bond. By connecting a thermodynamically controlled rearrangement process to resolution under kinetic control, the catalyst system underwent kinetic self-sorting, resulting in amplification of a more reactive catalyst while establishing a catalytic feedback mechanism. The dynamic catalyst system furthermore responded to catalytic events by self-perturbation to regulate its own activity, which in the case of upregulation gave rise to systemic autocatalytic behavior."
A combination of NHC organocatalysis and transition-metal catalysis gives rise to fundamentally new cooperative reactivity and enables the regio- and enantioselective annulation reaction between enals and vinyl benzoxazinanones. The cooperative umpolung annulation eliminates mutual deactivation and leads to a diverse set of benzazepine derivatives in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). The development of such a cooperative catalytic system dramatically expands the scope of NHC organocatalysis by opening up new metal-catalyzed reaction pathways for homoenolate intermediates.
"A new pathway for homogeneous electrocatalytic H2 evolution and H2 oxidation has been developed using a redox active thiosemicarbazone and its zinc complex as seminal metal-free and transition-metal-free examples. Diacetyl-bis(N-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone) and zinc diacetyl-bis(N-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazide) display the highest reported TOFs of any homogeneous ligand-centered H2 evolution catalyst, 1320 and 1170 s\xe2\x80\x931, respectively, while the zinc complex also displays one of the highest reported TOF values for H2 oxidation, 72 s\xe2\x80\x931, of any homogeneous catalyst. Catalysis proceeds via ligand-centered proton-transfer and electron-transfer events while avoiding traditional metal-hydride intermediates. The unique mechanism is consistent with electrochemical results and is further supported by density functional theory. The results identify a new direction for the design of electrocatalysts for H2 evolution and H2 oxidation that are not reliant on metal-hydride intermediates."
"We report the total structure determination of a large bimetallic nanocluster with an overall composition of [Au80Ag30(C\xe2\x89\xa1CPh)42Cl9]Cl. It is the largest structurally characterized bimetallic coinage nanocluster so far. The 110 metal atoms are distributed in a concentric four-shell Russian doll arrangement, Au6@Au35@Ag30Au18@Au21. There are 42 PhC\xe2\x89\xa1C\xe2\x80\x94 ligands and 9 \xce\xbc2-chloride ligands clamping on the cluster surface. The chloride is proven to be critical for the formation of this giant cluster, as the control experiment in the absence of halide gives only smaller species. This work demonstrates that the halide can play a key role in the formation of a large metal nanocluster, and the halide effect should be considered in the design and synthesis of metal nanoclusters."
"The pseudouridine synthases isomerize (U) in RNA to pseudouridine (\xce\xa8), and the mechanism that they follow has long been a question of interest. The recent elucidation of a product of the mechanistic probe 5-fluorouridine that had been epimerized to the arabino isomer suggested that the \xce\xa8 synthases might operate through a glycal intermediate formed by deprotonation of C2\xe2\x80\xb2. When that position in substrate U is deuterated, a primary kinetic isotope effect is observed, which indisputably indicates that the proposed deprotonation occurs during the isomerization of U to \xce\xa8 and establishes the mechanism followed by the \xce\xa8 synthases."
"We report the synthesis, crystal structure, and physical properties of a quinary iron arsenide fluoride, KCa2Fe4As4F2. The new compound crystallizes in a body-centered tetragonal lattice (space group I4/mmm, a = 3.8684(2) \xc3\x85, c = 31.007(1) \xc3\x85, Z = 2) that contains double Fe2As2 conducting layers separated by insulating Ca2F2 layers. Our measurements of electrical resistivity, direct-current magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity demonstrate bulk superconductivity at 33 K in KCa2Fe4As4F2."
"Chiral, neutral H-bond donors have found widespread use as catalysts in enantioselective reactions involving ion-pair intermediates. Herein, a systematic mechanistic study of a prototypical anion-binding reaction, the thiourea-catalyzed enantioselective alkylation of \xce\xb1-chloroethers, is detailed. This study reveals that the catalyst resting state is an inactive dimeric aggregate that must dissociate and then reassemble to form a 2:1 catalyst\xe2\x80\x93substrate complex in the rate-determining transition structure. Insight into this mode of catalyst cooperativity sheds light on the practical limitations that have plagued many of the H-bond donor-catalyzed reactions developed to date and suggests design strategies for new, highly efficient catalyst structures."
"A novel chiral 3D bioMOF exhibiting functional channels with thio-alkyl chains derived from the natural amino acid l-methionine (1) has been rationally prepared. The well-known strong affinity of gold for sulfur derivatives, together with the extremely high flexibility of the thioether \xe2\x80\x9carms\xe2\x80\x9d decorating the channels, account for a selective capture of gold(III) and gold(I) salts in the presence of other metal cations typically found in electronic wastes. The X-ray single-crystal structures of the different gold adsorbates AuIII@1 and AuI@1 suggest that the selective metal capture occurs in a metal ion recognition process somehow mimicking what happens in biological systems and protein receptors. Both AuIII@1 and AuI@1 display high activity as heterogeneous catalyst for the hydroalkoxylation of alkynes, further expanding the application of these novel hybrid materials."
"A counterintuitive approach to electrophilic aromatic substitution with silicon electrophiles is disclosed. A strong Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid that would usually promote the reverse reaction, i.e., protodesilylation, was found to initiate the C\xe2\x80\x93H silylation of electron-rich (hetero)arenes with hydrosilanes. Protonation of the hydrosilane followed by liberation of dihydrogen is key to success, fulfilling two purposes: to generate the stabilized silylium ion and to remove the proton released from the Wheland intermediate."
"The asymmetric (3 + 3) annulations of \xce\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2-acetoxy allenoates with either 3-oxo-nitriles or pyrazolones have been realized by using 6\xe2\x80\xb2-deoxy-6\xe2\x80\xb2-[(l)-N,N-(2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-oxidiethyl)-valine amido]quinine (6h) as the catalyst. The three functions of catalyst 6h, including Lewis base (quinuclidine N), H-bond donor (amide NH), and Br\xc3\xb8nsted base (morpholine N), cooperatively take crucial roles on the chemo- and enantioselectivity, allowing for the construction of 4H-pyran and 4H-pyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole in high yields and enantioselectivity."
"Anion\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interactions have been introduced to catalysis only recently, and evidence for their significance is so far limited to one classical model reaction in enolate and enamine chemistry. In this report, asymmetric anion\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 catalysis is achieved for the first time for a more demanding cascade process. The selected example affords six-membered carbocycles with five stereogenic centers in a single step from achiral and acyclic substrates. Rates, yields, turnover, diastereo- and enantioselectivity are comparable with conventional catalysts. Rates and stereoselectivity increase with the \xcf\x80-acidity of the new anion\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 catalysts. Further support for operational anion\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interactions in catalysis is obtained from inhibition with nitrate. As part of the stereogenic cascade reaction, iminium chemistry and conjugate additions are added to the emerging repertoire of asymmetric anion\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 catalysis."
"This work delineates the first example for controlling product selectivity in metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of biomass by zeolite crystals. The key to this success is to combine the advantages of both Pd nanoparticles (highly active sites) and zeolite micropores (controllable diffusion of reactants and products), which was achieved from encapsulation of the Pd nanoparticles inside of silicalite-I zeolite crystals as a core\xe2\x80\x93shell structure (Pd@S-1). In the hydrogenation of biomass-derived furfural, the furan selectivity over the Pd@S-1 is as high as 98.7%, outperforming the furan selectivity (5.6%) over conventional Pd nanoparticles impregnated with S-1 zeolite crystals (Pd/S-1). The extraordinary furan selectivity in the hydrogenation over the Pd@S-1 is reasonably attributed to the distinguishable mass transfer of the hydrogenated products in the zeolite micropores."
"A versatile methodology, involving readily available starting materials, allows for the synthesis of stable hemilabile bidentate cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) featuring alkene, ether, amine, imine, and phosphine functionalities. The stability of the free carbenes has been exploited for the synthesis of copper(I) and gold(I) complexes. It is shown that the pendant imine moiety stabilizes the gold(III) oxidation state and enables the C\xe2\x80\x93C bond oxidative addition of biphenylene to the corresponding cationic gold(I) complex. The latter and the corresponding copper(I) complex show high catalytic activity for the hydroarylation of \xce\xb1-methylstyrene with N,N-dimethylaniline, and the copper(I) complex promotes the anti-Markovnikov hydrohydrazination of phenyl acetylene with high selectivity."
"Use of a macrocyclic tetracarbene ligand, which is topologically reminiscent of tetrapyrrole macrocycles though electronically distinct, has allowed for the isolation, X-ray crystallographic characterization and comprehensive spectroscopic investigation of a complete set of {FeNO}x complexes (x = 6, 7, 8). Electrochemical reduction, or chemical reduction with CoCp2, of the {FeNO}7 complex 1 leads to the organometallic {FeNO}8 species 2. Its crystallographic structure determination is the first for a nonheme iron nitroxyl {FeNO}8 and has allowed to identify structural trends among the series of {FeNO}x complexes. Combined experimental data including 57Fe M\xc3\xb6ssbauer, IR, UV\xe2\x80\x93vis\xe2\x80\x93NIR, NMR and K\xce\xb2 X-ray emission spectroscopies in concert with DFT calculations suggest a largely metal centered reduction of 1 to form the low spin (S = 0) {FeNO}8 species 2. The very strong \xcf\x83-donor character of the tetracarbene ligand imparts unusual properties and spectroscopic signatures such as low 57Fe M\xc3\xb6ssbauer isomer shifts and linear Fe\xe2\x80\x93N\xe2\x80\x93O units with high IR stretching frequencies for the NO ligand. The observed metal-centered reduction leads to distinct reactivity patterns of the {FeNO}8 species. In contrast to literature reported {FeNO}8 complexes, 2 does not undergo NO protonation under strictly anaerobic conditions. Only in the presence of both dioxygen and protons is rapid and clean oxidation to the {FeNO}7 complex 1 observed. While 1 is stable toward dioxygen, its reaction with dioxygen under NO atmosphere forms the {FeNO}6(ONO) complex 3 that features an unusual O-nitrito ligand trans to the NO. 3 is a rare example of a nonheme octahedral {FeNO}6 complex. Its electrochemical or chemical reduction triggers dissociation of the O-nitrito ligand and sequential formation of the {FeNO}7 and {FeNO}8 compounds 1 and 2. A consistent electronic structure picture has been derived for these unique organometallic variants of the key bioinorganic {FeNO}x functional units."
"The process of silver immobilization onto and/or into bovine lactoferrin (LTF), the physicochemical properties of bovine lactoferrin and obtained silver-lactoferrin complexes, as well as antibacterial activity of silver-lactoferrin complexes were investigated in this work. Kinetic study of the silver immobilization into lactoferrin was carried out using batch sorption techniques. Spectrometric (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS, ICP-MS), spectroscopic (FTIR, SERS), electron microscopic (TEM) and electrophoretic (I-DE) techniques, as well as zeta potential measurements, were applied for characterization of LTF and binding nature of silver in Ag-LTF complexes. On the basis of the results of the kinetics study, it was established that the silver binding to LTF is a heterogeneous process involving two main stages: (i) internal diffusion and sorption onto external surface of lactoferrin globules; and (ii) internal diffusion and binding into lactoferrin globule structure. Spectroscopic techniques combined with TEM analysis confirmed the binding process. Molecular dynamics (MD) analysis was carried out in order to simulate the mechanism of the binding process, and locate potential binding sites, as well as complement the experimental findings. Quantum mechanics (QM) simulations were performed utilizing density functional theory (DFT) in order to support the reduction mechanism of silver ions to elemental silver. Antimicrobial activity of synthesized lactoferrin complexes against selected clinical bacteria was confirmed using flow cytometry and antibiograms."
"BINOL-derived phosphoric acids provide effective asymmetric catalysis for many organic reactions. Catalysts based on this scaffold show a large structural diversity, especially in the 3,3\xe2\x80\xb2 substituents, and little is known about the molecular requirements for high selectivity. As a result, selection of the best catalyst for a particular transformation requires a trial and error screening process, as the size of the 3,3\xe2\x80\xb2 substituents is not simply related to their efficacy: the right choice is neither too large nor too small. We have developed an approach to identify and quantify structural features on the catalyst that determine selectivity. We show that the application of quantitative steric parameters (a new measure, AREA(\xce\xb8), and rotation barrier) to an imine hydrogenation reaction allows the identification of catalyst features necessary for efficient stereoinduction, validated by QM/MM hybrid calculations."
"The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) of the high capacity anode material Si is monitored over multiple electrochemical cycles by 7Li, 19F, and 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, with the organics dominating the SEI. Homonuclear correlation experiments are used to identify the organic fragments \xe2\x88\x92OCH2CH2O\xe2\x80\x93, \xe2\x88\x92OCH2CH2\xe2\x80\x93, \xe2\x88\x92OCH2CH3, and \xe2\x88\x92CH2CH3 contained in both oligomeric species and lithium semicarbonates ROCO2Li, RCO2Li. The SEI growth is correlated with increasing electrode tortuosity by using focused ion beam and scanning electron microscopy. A two-stage model for lithiation capacity loss is developed: initially, the lithiation capacity steadily decreases, Li+ is irreversibly consumed at a steady rate, and pronounced SEI growth is seen. Later, below 50% of the initial lithiation capacity, less Si is (de)lithiated resulting in less volume expansion and contraction; the rate of Li+ being irreversibly consumed declines, and the Si SEI thickness stabilizes. The decreasing lithiation capacity is primarily attributed to kinetics, the increased electrode tortuousity severely limiting Li+ ion diffusion through the bulk of the electrode. The resulting changes in the lithiation processes seen in the electrochemical capacity curves are ascribed to non-uniform lithiation, the reaction commencing near the separator/on the surface of the particles."
"The highly enantio-, diastereo-, and regioselective dynamic kinetic resolution of \xce\xb2-ketoesters and 1,3-diketones was achieved via a chiral N-heterocyclic carbene catalyzed intramolecular cross-benzoin reaction. A variety of tetralone derivatives bearing two contiguous stereocenters and multiple functionalities were liberated in moderate to excellent yields and with high levels of stereoselectivity (>95% ee and >20:1 dr in most cases). In addition, the excellent regioselectivity control for aryl/alkyl 1,3-diketones, and the superior electronic differentiation of 1,3-diarylketones were highlighted. Moreover, a set of new mechanistic rationale that differs with the currently widely accepted understanding of intramolecular benzoin reactions was established to demonstrate the superior preference of benzoin over aldol transformation: (1) A coexistence of competitive aldol and benzoin reactions was detected, but a retro-aldol-irreversible benzoin process performs a vital role in the generation of predominant benzoin products. (2) The most essential role of an N-electron-withdrawing substituent in triazolium catalysts was revealed to be accelerating the rate of the benzoin transformation, rather than suppressing the aldol process through reducing the inherent basicity of the catalyst."
"We report the development of a new class of guanidine-containing peptides as multifunctional ligands for transition-metal catalysis and its application in the remote desymmetrization of diarylmethanes via copper-catalyzed Ullman cross-coupling. Through design of these peptides, high levels of enantioinduction and good isolated yields were achieved in the long-range asymmetric cross-coupling (up to 93:7 er and 76% yield) between aryl bromides and malonates. Our mechanistic studies suggest that distal stereocontrol is achieved through a Cs-bridged interaction between the Lewis-basic C-terminal carboxylate of the peptides with the distal arene of the substrate."
"Quantitating and understanding the physical forces responsible for the interactions of biomolecules are fundamental to the biological sciences. This is especially challenging for membrane proteins because they are embedded within cellular bilayers that provide a unique medium in which hydrophobic sequences must fold. Knowledge of the energetics of protein\xe2\x80\x93lipid interactions is thus vital to understand cellular processes involving membrane proteins. Here we used a host\xe2\x80\x93guest mutational strategy to calculate the Gibbs free energy changes of water-to-lipid transfer for the aromatic side chains Trp, Tyr, and Phe as a function of depth in the membrane. This work reveals an energetic gradient in the transfer free energies for Trp and Tyr, where transfer was most favorable to the membrane interfacial region and comparatively less favorable into the bilayer center. The transfer energetics follows the concentration gradient of polar atoms across the bilayer normal that naturally occurs in biological membranes. Additional measurements revealed nearest-neighbor coupling in the data set are influenced by a network of aromatic side chains in the host protein. Taken together, these results show that aromatic side chains contribute significantly to membrane protein stability through either aromatic\xe2\x80\x93aromatic interactions or placement at the membrane interface."
"Fluorinated tyrosines (FnY\xe2\x80\x99s, n = 2 and 3) have been site-specifically incorporated into E. coli class Ia ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) using the recently evolved M. jannaschii Y-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. Class Ia RNRs require four redox active Y\xe2\x80\x99s, a stable Y radical (Y\xc2\xb7) in the \xce\xb2 subunit (position 122 in E. coli), and three transiently oxidized Y\xe2\x80\x99s (356 in \xce\xb2 and 731 and 730 in \xce\xb1) to initiate the radical-dependent nucleotide reduction process. FnY (3,5; 2,3; 2,3,5; and 2,3,6) incorporation in place of Y122-\xce\xb2 and the X-ray structures of each resulting \xce\xb2 with a diferric cluster are reported and compared with wt-\xce\xb22 crystallized under the same conditions. The essential diferric-FnY\xc2\xb7 cofactor is self-assembled from apo FnY-\xce\xb22, Fe2+, and O2 to produce \xe2\x88\xbc1 Y\xc2\xb7/\xce\xb22 and \xe2\x88\xbc3 Fe3+/\xce\xb22. The FnY\xc2\xb7 are stable and active in nucleotide reduction with activities that vary from 5% to 85% that of wt-\xce\xb22. Each FnY\xc2\xb7-\xce\xb22 has been characterized by 9 and 130 GHz electron paramagnetic resonance and high-field electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopies. The hyperfine interactions associated with the 19F nucleus provide unique signatures of each FnY\xc2\xb7 that are readily distinguishable from unlabeled Y\xc2\xb7\xe2\x80\x99s. The variability of the abiotic FnY pKa\xe2\x80\x99s (6.4 to 7.8) and reduction potentials (\xe2\x88\x9230 to +130 mV relative to Y at pH 7.5) provide probes of enzymatic reactions proposed to involve Y\xc2\xb7\xe2\x80\x99s in catalysis and to investigate the importance and identity of hopping Y\xc2\xb7\xe2\x80\x99s within redox active proteins proposed to protect them from uncoupled radical chemistry."
"Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a promising nonprecious catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that has been extensively studied due to its excellent performance, but the lack of understanding of the factors that impact its catalytic activity hinders further design and enhancement of MoS2-based electrocatalysts. Here, by using novel porous (holey) metallic 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets synthesized by a liquid-ammonia-assisted lithiation route, we systematically investigated the contributions of crystal structure (phase), edges, and sulfur vacancies (S-vacancies) to the catalytic activity toward HER from five representative MoS2 nanosheet samples, including 2H and 1T phase, porous 2H and 1T phase, and sulfur-compensated porous 2H phase. Superior HER catalytic activity was achieved in the porous 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets that have even more edges and S-vacancies than conventional 1T phase MoS2. A comparative study revealed that the phase serves as the key role in determining the HER performance, as 1T phase MoS2 always outperforms the corresponding 2H phase MoS2 samples, and that both edges and S-vacancies also contribute significantly to the catalytic activity in porous MoS2 samples. Then, using combined defect characterization techniques of electron spin resonance spectroscopy and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy to quantify the S-vacancies, the contributions of each factor were individually elucidated. This study presents new insights and opens up new avenues for designing electrocatalysts based on MoS2 or other layered materials with enhanced HER performance."
"The reactivity of the homo- and heteronuclear oxide clusters [XYO2]+ (X, Y = Al, Si, Mg) toward methane was studied using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, in conjunction with high-level quantum mechanical calculations. The most reactive cluster by both experiment and theory is [Al2O2]\xe2\x80\xa2+. In its favorable pathway, this cluster abstracts a hydrogen atom by means of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) instead of following the conventional hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) route. This mechanistic choice originates in the strong Lewis acidity of the aluminum site of [Al2O2]\xe2\x80\xa2+, which cleaves the C\xe2\x80\x93H bond heterolytically to form an Al\xe2\x80\x93CH3 entity, while the proton is transferred to the bridging oxygen atom of the cluster ion. In addition, a comparison of the reactivity of heteronuclear and homonuclear oxide clusters [XYO2]+ (X, Y = Al, Si, Mg) reveals a striking doping effect by aluminum. Thus, the vacant s\xe2\x80\x93p hybrid orbital on Al acts as an acceptor of the electron pair from methyl anion (CH3\xe2\x80\x93) and is therefore eminently important for bringing about thermal methane activation by PCET. For the Al-doped cluster ions, the spin density at an oxygen atom, which is crucial for the HAT mechanism, acts here as a spectator during the course of the PCET mediated C\xe2\x80\x93H bond cleavage. A diagnostic plot of the deformation energy vis-\xc3\xa0-vis the barrier shows the different HAT/PCET reactivity map for the entire series. This is a strong connection to the recently discussed mechanism of oxidative coupling of methane on magnesium oxide surfaces proceeding through Grignard-type intermediates."
"A new, highly selective, bond functionalization strategy, achieved via relay of two transition metal catalysts and the use of traceless acetal directing groups, has been employed to provide facile formation of C\xe2\x80\x93Si bonds and concomitant functionalization of a silicon group in a single vessel. Specifically, this approach involves the relay of Ir-catalyzed hydrosilylation of inexpensive and readily available phenyl acetates, exploiting disubstituted silyl synthons to afford silyl acetals and Rh-catalyzed ortho-C\xe2\x80\x93H silylation to provide dioxasilines. A subsequent nucleophilic addition to silicon removes the acetal directing groups and directly provides unmasked phenol products and, thus, useful functional groups at silicon achieved in a single vessel. This traceless acetal directing group strategy for catalytic ortho-C\xe2\x80\x93H silylation of phenols was also successfully applied to preparation of multisubstituted arenes. Remarkably, a new formal \xce\xb1-chloroacetyl directing group has been developed that allows catalytic reductive C\xe2\x80\x93H silylation of sterically hindered phenols. In particular, this new method permits access to highly versatile and nicely differentiated 1,2,3-trisubstituted arenes that are difficult to access by other catalytic routes. In addition, the resulting dioxasilines can serve as chromatographically stable halosilane equivalents, which allow not only removal of acetal directing groups but also introduce useful functional groups leading to silicon-bridged biaryls. We demonstrated that this catalytic C\xe2\x80\x93H bond silylation strategy has powerful synthetic potential by creating direct applications of dioxasilines to other important transformations, examples of which include aryne chemistry, Au-catalyzed direct arylation, sequential orthogonal cross-couplings, and late-stage silylation of phenolic bioactive molecules and BINOL scaffolds."
"Accurate modeling of Li-ion batteries performance, particularly during the transient conditions experienced in automotive applications, requires knowledge of electrolyte transport properties (ionic conductivity \xce\xba, salt diffusivity D, and lithium ion transference number t+) over a wide range of salt concentrations and temperatures. While specific conductivity data can be easily obtained with modern computerized instrumentation, this is not the case for D and t+. A combination of NMR and MRI techniques was used to solve the problem. The main advantage of such an approach over classical electrochemical methods is its ability to provide spatially resolved details regarding the chemical and dynamic features of charged species in solution, hence the ability to present a more accurate characterization of processes in an electrolyte under operational conditions. We demonstrate herein data on ion transport properties (D and t+) of concentrated LiPF6 solutions in a binary ethylene carbonate (EC)\xe2\x80\x93dimethyl carbonate (DMC) 1:1 v/v solvent mixture, obtained by the proposed technique. The buildup of steady-state (time-invariant) ion concentration profiles during galvanostatic experiments with graphite\xe2\x80\x93lithium metal cells containing the electrolyte was monitored by pure phase-encoding single point imaging MRI. We then derived the salt diffusivity and Li+ transference number over the salt concentration range 0.78\xe2\x80\x931.27 M from a pseudo-3D combined PFG-NMR and MRI technique. The results obtained with our novel methodology agree with those obtained by electrochemical methods, but in contrast to them, the concentration dependences of salt diffusivity and Li+ transference number were obtained simultaneously within the single in situ experiment."
"Location recognition at the molecular scale provides valuable information about the nature of functional molecular materials. This study presents a novel location sensing approach based on an endohedral metallofullerene, Ce@C82, using its anisotropic magnetic properties, which lead to temperature-dependent paramagnetic shifts in 1H NMR spectra. Five site-isomers of Ce@C82CH2-3,5-C6H3Me2 were synthesized to demonstrate the spatial sensing ability of Ce@C82. Single-crystal structures, absorption spectra, and density functional theory calculations were used to select the plausible addition positions in the radical coupling reaction, which preferentially happens on the carbon atoms with high electron density of the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) and positive charge. Temperature-dependent NMR measurements demonstrated unique paramagnetic shifts of the 1H peaks, which were derived from the anisotropic magnetism of the f-electron in the Ce atom of the isomers. It was found that the magnetic anisotropy axes can be easily predicted by theoretical calculations using the Gaussian 09 package. Further analysis revealed that the temperature-dependent trend in the shifts is clearly predictable from the distance and relative position of the proton from the Ce atom. Hence, the Ce-encapsulated metallofullerene Ce@C82 can provide spatial location information about nearby atoms through the temperature-dependent paramagnetic shifts of its NMR signals. It can act as a molecular probe for location sensing by utilizing the anisotropic magnetism of the encapsulated Ce atom. The potentially low toxicity and stability of the endohedral fullerene would make Ce@C82 suitable for applications in biology and material science."
"An E unsaturated fumaramide linkage may be introduced into Aib peptide foldamer structures by standard coupling methods and photoisomerized to its Z (maleamide) isomer by irradiation with UV light. As a result of the photoisomerization, a new hydrogen-bonded contact becomes possible between the peptide domains located on either side of the unsaturated linkage. Using the fumaramide/maleamide linker to couple a chiral and an achiral fragment allows the change in hydrogen bond network to communicate a conformational preference, inducing a screw sense preference in the achiral domain of the maleamide-linked foldamers that is absent from the fumaramides. Evidence for the induced screw sense preference is provided by NMR and CD, and also by the turning on by light of the diastereoselectivity of a peptide chain extension reaction. The fumaramide/maleamide linker thus acts as a \xe2\x80\x9cconformational photodiode\xe2\x80\x9d that conducts stereochemical information as a result of irradiation by UV light."
"Herein we describe our efforts to elucidate the key mechanistic aspects of the previously reported enantioselective photochemical \xce\xb1-alkylation of aldehydes with electron-poor organic halides. The chemistry exploits the potential of chiral enamines, key organocatalytic intermediates in thermal asymmetric processes, to directly participate in the photoexcitation of substrates either by forming a photoactive electron donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor complex or by directly reaching an electronically excited state upon light absorption. These photochemical mechanisms generate radicals from closed-shell precursors under mild conditions. At the same time, the ground-state chiral enamines provide effective stereochemical control over the enantioselective radical-trapping process. We use a combination of conventional photophysical investigations, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and kinetic studies to gain a better understanding of the factors governing these enantioselective photochemical catalytic processes. Measurements of the quantum yield reveal that a radical chain mechanism is operative, while reaction-profile analysis and rate-order assessment indicate the trapping of the carbon-centered radical by the enamine, to form the carbon\xe2\x80\x93carbon bond, as rate-determining. Our kinetic studies unveil the existence of a delicate interplay between the light-triggered initiation step and the radical chain propagation manifold, both mediated by the chiral enamines."
"The exploitable properties of many materials are intimately linked to symmetry-lowering structural phase transitions. We present an automated and exhaustive symmetry-mode method for systematically exploring and solving such structures which will be widely applicable to a range of functional materials. We exemplify the method with an investigation of the Bi2Sn2O7 pyrochlore, which has been shown to undergo transitions from a parent \xce\xb3 cubic phase to \xce\xb2 and \xce\xb1 structures on cooling. The results include the first reliable structural model for \xce\xb2-Bi2Sn2O7 (orthorhombic Aba2, a = 7.571833(8), b = 21.41262(2), and c = 15.132459(14) \xc3\x85) and a much simpler description of \xce\xb1-Bi2Sn2O7 (monoclinic Cc, a = 13.15493(6), b = 7.54118(4), and c = 15.07672(7) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 125.0120(3)\xc2\xb0) than has been presented previously. We use the symmetry-mode basis to describe the phase transition in terms of coupled rotations of the Bi2O\xe2\x80\xb2 anti-cristobalite framework, which allow Bi atoms to adopt low-symmetry coordination environments favored by lone-pair cations."
An effort to improve charge carrier transport in low-crystalline conjugated polymers reveals superior field-effect mobility compared to a highly crystalline conjugated polymer.
"Linear free energy relationship (LFER) parameters are routinely used to parametrize physicochemical effects while investigating reaction mechanisms. In this Communication, we describe an alternate application for LFERs: training sets for model building in an analytical application. In this study, the sterics, quantified by Charton parameters (\xce\x94v), of nine secondary chiral alcohol analytes were correlated to the circular dichroism output from a chiral alcohol optical sensor. To test the validity of the model, the correlative linear model was applied to determine the enantiomeric excess of samples of two alcohols without a priori knowledge of a calibration curve. The error in this method was comparable to those of previous experimental methods (<5%)."
"Hydroxylation reactions of aromatic rings are key reactions in various biological and chemical processes. In spite of their significance, no consensus mechanism has been established. Here we performed Marcus plot analysis for aromatic hydroxylation reactions with oxoiron(IV) porphyrin \xcf\x80-cation radical complexes (compound I). Although many recent studies support the mechanism involving direct electrophilic attack of compound I, the slopes of the Marcus plots indicate a significant contribution of an electron transfer process in the rate-limiting step, leading us to propose a new reaction mechanism in which the electron transfer process between an aromatic compound and compound I is in equilibrium in a solvent cage and coupled with the subsequent bond formation process."
"Immobilized enzymes typically have greater thermal and operational stability than their soluble form. Here we report that for the first time, a nerve agent detoxifying enzyme, organophosphorus acid anhydrolase (OPAA), has been successfully encapsulated into a water-stable zirconium metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework (MOF). This MOF features a hierarchical mesoporous channel structure and exhibits a 12 wt % loading capacity of OPAA. The thermal and long-term stabilities of OPAA are both significantly enhanced after immobilization."
"Thymidylate synthase is an attractive target for antibiotic and anticancer drugs due to its essential role in the de novo biosynthesis of the DNA nucleotide thymine. The enzymatic reaction is initiated by a nucleophilic activation of the substrate via formation of a covalent bond to an active site cysteine. The traditionally accepted mechanism is then followed by a series of covalently bound intermediates, where that bond is only cleaved upon product release. Recent computational and experimental studies suggest that the covalent bond between the protein and substrate is actually quite labile. Importantly, these findings predict the existence of a noncovalently bound bisubstrate intermediate, not previously anticipated, which could be the target of a novel class of drugs inhibiting DNA biosynthesis. Here we report the synthesis of the proposed intermediate and findings supporting its chemical and kinetic competence. These findings substantiate the predicted nontraditional mechanism and the potential of this intermediate as a new drug lead."
"The combination of molecular dyes and catalysts with semiconductors into dye-sensitized solar fuel devices (DSSFDs) requires control of efficient interfacial and surface charge transfer between the components. The present study reports on the light-induced electron transfer processes of p-type NiO films cosensitized with coumarin C343 and a bioinspired proton reduction catalyst, [FeFe](mcbdt)(CO)6 (mcbdt = 3-carboxybenzene-1,2-dithiolate). By transient optical spectroscopy we find that ultrafast interfacial electron transfer (\xcf\x84 \xe2\x89\x88 200 fs) from NiO to the excited C343 (\xe2\x80\x9chole injection\xe2\x80\x9d) is followed by rapid (t1/2 \xe2\x89\x88 10 ps) and efficient surface electron transfer from C343\xe2\x80\x93 to the coadsorbed [FeFe](mcbdt)(CO)6. The reduced catalyst has a clear spectroscopic signature that persists for several tens of microseconds, before charge recombination with NiO holes occurs. The demonstration of rapid surface electron transfer from dye to catalyst on NiO, and the relatively long lifetime of the resulting charge separated state, suggests the possibility to use these systems for photocathodes on DSSFDs."
"Mixing cyclic pentagonal pillar[5]quinone with cyclic hexagonal pillar[6]arene in a 12:20 molar feed ratio resulted in spontaneous production of vesicles, while assembly of pillar[6]arene and pillar[5]quinone alone produced hexagonal disks and wires, respectively. Incorporation of pentagonal pillar[5]quinone rings into hexagonal pillar[6]arene sheets gave curvature and contributed to the formation of vesicles. Conventional vesicles are generally synthesized by assembly of amphiphilic molecules containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. Therefore, the co-assembly of pentagonal and hexagonal molecules to obtain spherical vesicles demonstrated in this study is a new concept based on geometric design."
"Nickel-catalyzed additions of arylboronic acids to alkynes, followed by enantioselective cyclizations of the alkenylnickel species onto tethered ketones or enones, are reported. These reactions are reliant upon the formal anti-carbonickelation of the alkyne, which is postulated to occur by the reversible E/Z isomerization of an alkenylnickel species."
"Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have emerged as a novel class of porous metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs) for catalysis application because of their exceptional thermal and chemical stability. Inspired by the broad absorption of ZIF-67 in UV\xe2\x80\x93vis-near IR region, we explored its excited state and charge separation dynamics, properties essential for photocatalytic applications, using optical (OTA) and X-ray transient absorption (XTA) spectroscopy. OTA results show that an exceptionally long-lived excited state is formed after photoexcitation. This long-lived excited state was confirmed to be the charge-separated (CS) state with ligand-to-metal charge-transfer character using XTA. The surprisingly long-lived CS state, together with its intrinsic hybrid nature, all point to its potential application in heterogeneous photocatalysis and energy conversion."
"Exploration of heterogeneous molecular catalysts combining the atomic-level tunability of molecular structures and the practical handling advantages of heterogeneous catalysts represents an attractive approach to developing high-performance catalysts for important and challenging chemical reactions such as electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction which holds the promise for converting emissions back to fuels utilizing renewable energy. Thus, far, efficient and selective electroreduction of CO2 to deeply reduced products such as hydrocarbons remains a big challenge. Here, we report a molecular copper-porphyrin complex (copper(II)-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)porphyrin) that can be used as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst with high activity and selectivity for reducing CO2 to hydrocarbons in aqueous media. At \xe2\x88\x920.976 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode, the catalyst is able to drive partial current densities of 13.2 and 8.4 mA cm\xe2\x80\x932 for methane and ethylene production from CO2 reduction, corresponding to turnover frequencies of 4.3 and 1.8 molecules\xc2\xb7site\xe2\x80\x931\xc2\xb7s\xe2\x80\x931 for methane and ethylene, respectively. This represents the highest catalytic activity to date for hydrocarbon production over a molecular CO2 reduction electrocatalyst. The unprecedented catalytic performance is attributed to the built-in hydroxyl groups in the porphyrin structure and the reactivity of the copper(I) metal center."
"Direct NMR hyperpolarization of naturally abundant 15N sites in metronidazole is demonstrated using SABRE-SHEATH (Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei). In only a few tens of seconds, nuclear spin polarization P15N of up to \xe2\x88\xbc24% is achieved using parahydrogen with 80% para fraction corresponding to P15N \xe2\x89\x88 32% if \xe2\x88\xbc100% parahydrogen were employed (which would translate to a signal enhancement of \xe2\x88\xbc0.1-million-fold at 9.4 T). In addition to this demonstration on the directly binding 15N site (using J2H-15N), we also hyperpolarized more distant 15N sites in metronidazole using longer-range spin\xe2\x80\x93spin couplings (J4H-15N and J5H-15N). Taken together, these results significantly expand the range of molecular structures and sites amenable to hyperpolarization via low-cost parahydrogen-based methods. In particular, hyperpolarized nitroimidazole and its derivatives have powerful potential applications such as direct in vivo imaging of mechanisms of action or hypoxia sensing."
"A strategy for cross-electrophile coupling has been developed via the merger of photoredox and transition metal catalysis. In this report, we demonstrate the use of commercially available tris(trimethylsilyl)silane with metallaphotoredox catalysis to efficiently couple alkyl bromides with aryl or heteroaryl bromides in excellent yields. We hypothesize that a photocatalytically generated silyl radical species can perform halogen-atom abstraction to activate alkyl halides as nucleophilic cross-coupling partners. This protocol allows the use of mild yet robust conditions to construct Csp3\xe2\x80\x93Csp2 bonds generically via a unique cross-coupling pathway."
"The polyketide natural product (+)-SCH 351448, a macrodiolide ionophore bearing 14 stereogenic centers, is prepared in 14 steps (LLS). In eight prior syntheses, 22\xe2\x80\x9332 steps were required. Multiple chemoselective and redox-economic functional group interconversions collectively contribute to a step-change in efficiency."
"The development of photoredox reactions of aryloxy-amides for the generation of amidyl radicals and their use in hydroamination\xe2\x80\x93cyclization and N-arylation reactions is reported. Owing to the ease of single-electron-transfer reduction of the aryloxy-amides, the organic dye eosin Y was used as the photoredox catalyst, which results in fully transition-metal-free processes. These transformations exhibit a broad scope, are tolerant to several important functionalities, and have been used in the late-stage modification of complex and high-value N-containing molecules."
"Charge carriers typically move faster in crystalline regions than in amorphous regions in conjugated polymers because polymer chains adopt a regular arrangement resulting in a high degree of \xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93\xcf\x80 stacking in crystalline regions. In contrast, the random polymer chain orientation in amorphous regions hinders connectivity between conjugated backbones; thus, it hinders charge carrier delocalization. Various studies have attempted to enhance charge carrier transport by increasing crystallinity. However, these approaches are inevitably limited by the semicrystalline nature of conjugated polymers. Moreover, high-crystallinity conjugated polymers have proven inadequate for soft electronics applications because of their poor mechanical resilience. Increasing the polymer chain connectivity by forming localized aggregates via \xcf\x80-orbital overlap among several conjugated backbones in amorphous regions provides a more effective approach to efficient charge carrier transport. A simple strategy relying on the density of random copolymer alkyl side chains was developed to generate these localized aggregates. In this strategy, steric hindrance caused by these side chains was modulated to change their density. Interestingly, a random polymer exhibiting low alkyl side chain density and crystallinity displayed greatly enhanced field-effect mobility (1.37 cm2/(V\xc2\xb7s)) compared with highly crystalline poly(3-hexylthiophene)."
"C\xe2\x80\x93O bond activation on monofunctional catalysts (metals, carbides, and oxides) is challenging due to activity constraints imposed by energy scaling relationships. Yet, contrary to predictions, recently discovered multifunctional metal/metal oxide catalysts (e.g., Rh/ReOx, Rh/MoOx, Ir/VOx) demonstrate unusually high C\xe2\x80\x93O scission activity at moderate temperatures. Herein, we use extensive density functional theory calculations, first-principles microkinetic modeling, and electronic structure analysis to elucidate the metal/metal oxide synergy in the Ru/RuO2 catalyst, which enables up to 76% yield of the C\xe2\x80\x93O scission product (2-methyl furan) in catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis of furfural at low temperatures. Our key mechanistic finding is a facile radical-mediated C\xe2\x80\x93O bond activation on RuO2 oxygen vacancies, which directly leads to a weakly bound final product. This is the first time the radical reduction mechanism is reported in heterogeneous catalysis at temperatures <200 \xc2\xb0C. We attribute the unique catalytic properties to the formation of a conjugation-stabilized furfuryl radical upon C\xe2\x80\x93O bond scission, the strong hydroxyl affinity of oxygen vacancies due to the metallic character of RuO2, and the acid\xe2\x80\x93base heterogeneity of the oxide surface. The conjugation-driven radical-assisted C\xe2\x80\x93O bond scission applies to any catalytic surface that preserves the \xcf\x80-electron system of the reactant and leads to C\xe2\x80\x93O selectivity enhancement, with notable examples including Cu, H-covered Pd, self-assembled monolayers on Pd, and oxygen-covered Mo2C. Furthermore, we reveal the cooperativity of active sites in multifunctional catalysts. The mechanism is fully consistent with kinetic studies and isotopic labeling experiments, and the insights gained might prove useful more broadly in overcoming activity constraints induced by energy scaling relationships."
"Emerging work on organocatalytic enantioselective halocyclizations naturally draws on conditions where both new bonds must be formed under delicate control, the reaction regime where the concerted nature of the AdE3 mechanism is of greatest importance. Without assistance, many simple alkene substrates react slowly or not at all with conventional halenium donors under synthetically relevant reaction conditions. As demonstrated earlier by Shilov, Cambie, Williams, Fahey, and others, alkenes can undergo a concerted AdE3-type reaction via nucleophile participation, which sets the configuration of the newly created stereocenters at both ends in one step. Herein, we explore the modulation of alkene reactivity and halocyclization rates by nucleophile proximity and basicity, through detailed analyses of starting material spectroscopy, addition stereopreferences, isotope effects, and nucleophile\xe2\x80\x93alkene interactions, all obtained in a context directly relevant to synthesis reaction conditions. The findings build on the prior work by highlighting the reactivity spectrum of halocyclizations from stepwise to concerted, and suggest strategies for design of new reactions. Alkene reactivity is seen to span the range from the often overgeneralized \xe2\x80\x9csophomore textbook\xe2\x80\x9d image of stepwise electrophilic attack on the alkene and subsequent nucleophilic bond formation, to the nucleophile-assisted alkene activation (NAAA) cases where electron donation from the nucleophilic addition partner activates the alkene for electrophilic attack. By highlighting the factors that control reactivity across this range, this study suggests opportunities to explain and control stereo-, regio-, and organocatalytic chemistry in this important class of alkene additions."
"Conversion of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) to value-added products is an important challenge for sustainable energy research, and nanomaterials offer a broad class of heterogeneous catalysts for such transformations. Here we report a molecular surface functionalization approach to tuning gold nanoparticle (Au NP) electrocatalysts for reduction of CO2 to CO. The N-heterocyclic (NHC) carbene-functionalized Au NP catalyst exhibits improved faradaic efficiency (FE = 83%) for reduction of CO2 to CO in water at neutral pH at an overpotential of 0.46 V with a 7.6-fold increase in current density compared to that of the parent Au NP (FE = 53%). Tafel plots of the NHC carbene-functionalized Au NP (72 mV/decade) vs parent Au NP (138 mV/decade) systems further show that the molecular ligand influences mechanistic pathways for CO2 reduction. The results establish molecular surface functionalization as a complementary approach to size, shape, composition, and defect control for nanoparticle catalyst design."
"The nucleosome is the fundamental unit for packaging the genome. A detailed molecular picture for its conformational dynamics is crucial for understanding transcription and gene regulation. We investigate the disassembly of single nucleosomes using a predictive coarse-grained protein DNA model with transferable force fields. This model quantitatively describes the thermodynamic stability of both the histone core complex and the nucleosome and predicts rates of transient nucleosome opening that match experimental measurements. Quantitative characterization of the free-energy landscapes reveals the mechanism of nucleosome unfolding in which DNA unwinding and histone protein disassembly are coupled. The interfaces between H2A-H2B dimers and the (H3-H4)2 tetramer are first lost when the nucleosome opens releasing a large fraction but not all of its bound DNA. For the short strands studied in single molecule experiments, the DNA unwinds asymmetrically from the histone proteins, with only one of its two ends preferentially exposed. The detailed molecular mechanism revealed in this work provides a structural basis for interpreting experimental studies of nucleosome unfolding."
"Electronic traps at the inorganic\xe2\x80\x93organic interface of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are detrimental to their luminescent properties. Several types of interface traps were identified for single-crystalline CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs, which were all found to be extrinsic to either the core/shell structure or their optical performance. The electron traps\xe2\x80\x94presumably excess or unpassivated Cd surface sites\xe2\x80\x94are shallow ones and could be readily isolated from the electron wave function of the excitons with more than \xe2\x88\xbc2 monolayers of CdS shell. There were two identifiable deep hole traps within the bandgap of the QDs, i.e., the surface adsorbed H2S and unpassivated surface S sites. The surface adsorbed H2S could be removed by either degassing processes or photochemical decomposition of H2S without damaging the QDs. The unpassivated surface S sites could be removed by surface treatment with cadmium carboxylates. Understanding of the surface traps enabled establishment of new phosphine-free synthetic schemes for either single-precursor or successive-ion-layer-adsorption-and-reaction approach, which yielded CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs with near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield and monoexponential photoluminescence decay dynamics with 2\xe2\x80\x9310 monolayers of CdS shell."
"Together with the influenza A virus, influenza B virus causes seasonal flu epidemics. The M2 protein of influenza B (BM2) forms a tetrameric proton-conducting channel that is important for the virus lifecycle. BM2 shares little sequence homology with AM2, except for a conserved HxxxW motif in the transmembrane (TM) domain. Unlike AM2, no antiviral drugs have been developed to block the BM2 channel. To elucidate the proton-conduction mechanism of BM2 and to facilitate the development of BM2 inhibitors, we have employed solid-state NMR spectroscopy to investigate the conformation, dynamics, and hydration of the BM2 TM domain in lipid bilayers. BM2 adopts an \xce\xb1-helical conformation in lipid membranes. At physiological temperature and low pH, the proton-selective residue, His19, shows relatively narrow 15N chemical exchange peaks for the imidazole nitrogens, indicating fast proton shuttling that interconverts cationic and neutral histidines. Importantly, pH-dependent 15N chemical shifts indicate that His19 retains the neutral population to much lower pH than His37 in AM2, indicating larger acid-dissociation constants or lower pKa\xe2\x80\x99s. We attribute these dynamical and equilibrium differences to the presence of a second titratable histidine, His27, which may increase the proton-dissociation rate of His19. Two-dimensional 1H\xe2\x80\x9313C correlation spectra probing water 1H polarization transfer to the peptide indicates that the BM2 channel becomes much more hydrated at low pH than at high pH, particularly at Ser12, indicating that the pore-facing serine residues in BM2 mediate proton relay to the proton-selective histidine."
"Photothermal conversion is one of the most important keys in the fields of solar collection, photo-hyperthermia, etc., and its performance is highly dependent on the photothermal conversion materials used. Especially in cancer photo-hyperthermia, the presently available small-molecule- or nanomaterial-based agents still suffer from numerous drawbacks, such as nonspecific accumulation and inevitable side effects on normal tissues. Here we identify a Mo-based polyoxometalate cluster that can change its dimension from small (1 nm) to big (tens of nanometer), favoring its intratumoral accumulation, and enhance photothermal conversion in response to the intratumoral acidity and reducibility, demonstrating a previously unrealized tumor-specific photo-hyperthermia. Distinct from the well-researched nano-based agents, a unique electronic structure of this cluster has been identified as the origin of the observed acidity-induced self-assembly and reduction-promoted NIR absorbance. In addition to providing a promising clinical agent, this finding is expected to establish a new physicochemical paradigm for photothermal materials design based on clusters."
"In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), the electron transfer from photoexcited dye molecules to semiconductor substrates remains a major bottleneck. Replacing TiO2 with ZnO is expected to enhance the efficiency of DSCs, owing to the latter possesses a much larger electron mobility, but similar bandgap and band positions as TiO2 remain. However, the record efficiency of ZnO-based DSCs is only 7% compared with 13% of TiO2-based DSCs due to the even slower electron-transfer rate in ZnO-based DSCs, which becomes a long-standing puzzle. Here, we computationally investigate the electron transfer from the dye molecule into ZnO and TiO2, respectively, by performing the first-principles calculations within the frame of the Marcus theory. The predicted electron-transfer rate in the TiO2-based DSC is about 1.15 \xc3\x97 109 s\xe2\x80\x931, a factor of 15 faster than that of the ZnO-based DSC, which is in good agreement with experimental data. We find that the much larger density of states of the TiO2 compared with ZnO near the conduction band edge is the dominant factor, which is responsible for the faster electron-transfer rate in TiO2-based DSCs. These denser states provide additional efficient channels for the electron transfer. We also provide design principles to boost the efficiency of DSCs through surface engineering of high mobility photoanode semiconductors."
"In organic synthesis, the composition and structure of products are predetermined by the reaction conditions; however, the synthesis of well-defined inorganic nanostructures often presents a significant challenge yielding nonstoichiometric or polymorphic products. In this study, confinement in the nanoscale cavities of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) provides a new approach for multistep inorganic synthesis where sequential chemical transformations take place within the same nanotube. In the first step, SWNTs donate electrons to reactant iodine molecules (I2), transforming them to iodide anions (I\xe2\x80\x93). These then react with metal hexacarbonyls (M(CO)6, M = Mo or W) in the next step, yielding anionic nanoclusters [M6I14]2\xe2\x80\x93, the size and composition of which are strictly dictated by the nanotube cavity, as demonstrated by aberration-corrected high resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Atoms in the nanoclusters [M6I14]2\xe2\x80\x93 are arranged in a perfect octahedral geometry and can engage in further chemical reactions within the nanotube, either reacting with each other leading to a new polymeric phase of molybdenum iodide [Mo6I12]n or with hydrogen sulfide gas giving rise to nanoribbons of molybdenum/tungsten disulfide [MS2]n in the third step of the synthesis. Electron microscopy measurements demonstrate that the products of the multistep inorganic transformations are precisely controlled by the SWNT nanoreactor with complementary Raman spectroscopy revealing the remarkable property of SWNTs to act as a reservoir of electrons during the chemical transformation. The electron transfer from the host nanotube to the reacting guest molecules is essential for stabilizing the anionic metal iodide nanoclusters and for their further transformation to metal disulfide nanoribbons synthesized in the nanotubes in high yield."
"The use of hydrogen-bonding interactions to direct the noncovalent assembly of a Re-based bimetallic supramolecular electrocatalyst containing either tyrosine or phenylalanine residues is reported. Computational modeling and spectroelectrochemical characterization indicate that under catalytic conditions the phenol residues of tyrosine can act both as pendant proton sources and participate in the structural assembly of the bimetallic active species. As a result, an increased rate of catalysis is observed experimentally for the reductive disproportionation of CO2 to CO and CO32\xe2\x80\x93 by a tyrosine-modified complex in comparison to a control complex containing phenylalanine residues. These findings demonstrate that noncovalent assembly is a powerful method for generating new bimetallic electrocatalyst systems where the choice of substituent can be used to both control structural assembly and introduce cocatalytic moieties."
"The steric-environment sensitivity of fluorescence of 9,10-bis(N,N-dialkylamino)anthracenes (BDAAs) was studied experimentally and theoretically. A new design strategy to tune simple aromatic hydrocarbons as efficient aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens and molecular rotors is proposed. For a variety of BDAAs, prominent Stokes shifts and efficient solid-state fluorescence were observed. Calculations on BDAA-methyl suggested that in the ground state (S0) conformations, the pyramidal amine groups are highly twisted, so that their lone-pair orbitals cannot conjugate with the anthracene \xcf\x80 orbitals. Fluorescence takes place from the S1 minima, in which one or both amine groups are planarized. The stability of the S1 excited state minima as well as destabilization of the S0 state is the origin of large Stokes shift. Experimental measurement of the nonadiabatic transition rate suggests that para disubstitution by dialkylamino (or strongly electron-donating) groups is a key for fast internal conversion. Minimum energy conical intersection (MECI) between S1 and S0 states was found to have a Dewar-benzene like structure. Although this can be reached efficiently in liquid phase for fast internal conversion, a large amplitude motion is required to reach this MECI, which is prohibited in the solid state and caused efficient AIE. This strategy is used to find experimentally that naphthalene analogues are also efficient AIE luminogens. The flexibility of alkyl chains on amino groups is also found to be important for allowed charge-transfer transition. Thus, three points [(1) highly twisted N,N-dialkylamines, (2) substitution at the para positions, (3) with flexible alkyl groups] were proposed for activation of small aromatic hydrocarbons."
"Ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) and high-pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (HPSTM) were used to study the structure and chemistry of model Cu(100) and Cu(111) catalyst surfaces in the adsorption and dissociation of CO2. It was found that the (100) face is more active in dissociating CO2 than the (111) face. Atomic oxygen formed after the dissociation of CO2 poisons the surface by blocking further adsorption of CO2. This \xe2\x80\x9cself-poisoning\xe2\x80\x9d mechanism explains the need to mix CO into the industrial feed for methanol production from CO2, as it scavenges the chemisorbed O. The HPSTM images show that the (100) surface breaks up into nanoclusters in the presence of CO2 at 20 Torr and above, producing active kink and step sites. If the surface is precovered with atomic oxygen, no such nanoclustering occurs."
"Di-tert-butyliminoborane is found to be a very useful synthon for the synthesis of a variety of functionalized 1,4-azaborinines by the Rh-mediated cyclization of iminoboranes with alkynes. The reactions proceed via [2 + 2] cycloaddition of iminoboranes and alkynes in the presence of [RhCl(PiPr3)2]2, which gives a rhodium \xce\xb74-1,2-azaborete complex that yields 1,4-azaborinines upon reaction with acetylene. This reaction is compatible with substrates containing more than one alkynyl unit, cleanly affording compounds containing multiple 1,4-azaborinines. The substitution of terminal alkynes for acetylene also led to 1,4-azaborinines, enabling ring substitution at a predetermined location. We report the first general synthesis of this new methodology, which provides highly regioselective access to valuable 1,4-azaborinines in moderate yields. A mechanistic rationale for this reaction is supported by DFT calculations, which show the observed regioselectivity to arise from steric effects in the B\xe2\x80\x93C bond coupling en route to the rhodium \xce\xb74-1,2-azaborete complex and the selective oxidative cleavage of the B\xe2\x80\x93N bond of the 1,2-azaborete ligand in its subsequent reaction with acetylene."
"Chemical sensors offer opportunities for improving personal security, safety, and health. To enable broad adoption of chemical sensors requires performance and cost advantages that are best realized from innovations in the design of the sensing (transduction) materials. Ideal materials are sensitive and selective to specific chemicals or chemical classes and provide a signal that is readily interfaced with portable electronic devices. Herein we report that wrapping single walled carbon nanotubes with metallo-supramolecular polymers creates sensory devices with a dosimetric (time- and concentration-integrated) increase in electrical conductivity that is triggered by electrophilic chemical substances such as diethylchlorophosphate, a nerve agent simulant. The mechanism of this process involves the disassembly of the supramolecular polymer, and we demonstrate its utility in a wireless inductively powered sensing system based on near-field communication technology. Specifically, the dosimeters can be powered and read wirelessly with conventional smartphones to create sensors with ultratrace detection limits."
"Substitution of aliovalent N3\xe2\x80\x93 and F\xe2\x80\x93 anions in place of O2\xe2\x80\x93 in ZnO brings about major changes in the electronic structure and properties, the composition, even with 10 atomic percent or less of the two anions, rendering the material yellow colored with a much smaller band gap. We have examined the variation of band gap of ZnO with progressive substitution of N and F and more importantly prepared Zn2NF which is the composition one obtains ultimately upon complete replacement of O2\xe2\x80\x93 ions. In this article, we present the results of a first complete study of the crystal and electronic structures as well as of properties of a stable metal nitride fluoride, Zn2NF. This material occurs in two crystal forms, tetragonal and orthorhombic, both with a band gap much smaller than that of ZnO. Electronic structures of Zn2NF as well as ZnO0.2N0.5F0.3 investigated by first-principles calculations show that the valence bands of these are dominated by the N (2p) states lying at the top. Interestingly, the latter is a p-type material, a property that has been anticipated for long time. The calculations predict conduction and valence band edges in Zn2NF to be favorable for water splitting. Zn2NF does indeed exhibit good visible-light-induced hydrogen evolution activity unlike ZnO. The present study demonstrates how aliovalent anion substitution can be employed for tuning band gaps of materials."
"From the enediyne class of antitumor antibiotics, uncialamycin is among the rarest and most potent, yet one of the structurally simpler, making it attractive for chemical synthesis and potential applications in biology and medicine. In this article we describe a streamlined and practical enantioselective total synthesis of uncialamycin that is amenable to the synthesis of novel analogues and renders the natural product readily available for biological and drug development studies. Starting from hydroxy- or methoxyisatin, the synthesis features a Noyori enantioselective reduction, a Yamaguchi acetylide-pyridinium coupling, a stereoselective acetylide-aldehyde cyclization, and a newly developed annulation reaction that allows efficient coupling of a cyanophthalide and a p-methoxy semiquinone aminal to forge the anthraquinone moiety of the molecule. Overall, the developed streamlined synthesis proceeds in 22 linear steps (14 chromatographic separations) and 11% overall yield. The developed synthetic strategies and technologies were applied to the synthesis of a series of designed uncialamycin analogues equipped with suitable functional groups for conjugation to antibodies and other delivery systems. Biological evaluation of a select number of these analogues led to the identification of compounds with low picomolar potencies against certain cancer cell lines. These compounds and others like them may serve as powerful payloads for the development of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) intended for personalized targeted cancer therapy."
"We report density functional theory (M06-2X) studies of a series of dehydro-Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder (DDA) reactions. For these and the parent reaction, the stepwise mechanisms have similar barriers, whereas the barriers of the concerted mechanisms differ significantly. The reactivity of DDA reactions is controlled by distortion energy. The concerted and stepwise mechanisms of the hexadehydro-Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder (HDDA) reaction are competitive with activation barriers of \xe2\x88\xbc36 kcal/mol. This is because a large distortion energy (\xe2\x88\xbc43 kcal/mol) is required to achieve the concerted transition state geometry. MD simulations reveal that productive concerted trajectories display a strong angle bending oscillation (\xe2\x88\xbc25\xc2\xb0 oscillation amplitude), while the stepwise trajectories show only a chaotic pattern and less pronounced bending vibrations."
"In this study, we examined the structural and electronic complementarities of convex 1\xe2\x80\x93Zn(II), comprising functionalized tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) ligand, and concave baskets 2 and 3, having glycine and (S)-alanine amino acids at the rim. With the assistance of 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, we found that basket 2 would entrap 1\xe2\x80\x93Zn(II) in water to give equimolar 1\xe2\x80\x93Zn\xe2\x8a\x822in complex (K = (2.0 \xc2\xb1 0.2) \xc3\x97 103 M\xe2\x80\x931) resembling Russian nesting dolls. Moreover, C3 symmetric and enantiopure basket 3, containing (S)-alanine groups at the rim, was found to transfer its static chirality to entrapped 1\xe2\x80\x93Zn(II) and, via intermolecular ionic contacts, twist the ligand\xe2\x80\x99s pyridine rings into a left-handed (M) propeller (circular dichroism spectroscopy). With molecular baskets embodying the second coordination sphere about metal-containing TPAs, the here described findings should be useful for extending the catalytic function and chiral discrimination capability of TPAs."
"The possibility of designing programmable thin-film supramolecular structures with spontaneous polarization widens the utility of facile supramolecular chemistry. Although a range of low molecular mass molecular single crystals has been shown to exhibit ferroelectric polarization, demonstration of stimuli-responsive, thin-film, solution-processable supramolecular ferroelectric materials is rare. We introduce aromatic \xcf\x80-electron donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor molecular systems responsive to multiple stimuli that undergo supramolecular chiral mixed-stack charge-transfer (CT) coassembly through the tweezer-inclusion-sandwich process supported by hydrogen-bonding interactions. The structural synergy originating from hydrogen-bonding and chiral CT interactions resulted in the development of spontaneous unidirectional macroscopic polarization in the crystalline nanofibrous hydrogel network, under ambient conditions. Moreover, the tunability of these interactions with optical, mechanical, thermal, and electrical stimuli allowed the design of multistate thin-film memory devices. Our design strategy of the supramolecular motif is expected to help the development of new molecular engineering strategies for designing potentially useful smart multicomponent organic electronics."
"The ever growing increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is one of the main causes of global warming. Thus, CO2 activation and conversion toward valuable added compounds is a major scientific challenge. A new set of Au/\xce\xb4-MoC and Cu/\xce\xb4-MoC catalysts exhibits high activity, selectivity, and stability for the reduction of CO2 to CO with some subsequent selective hydrogenation toward methanol. Sophisticated experiments under controlled conditions and calculations based on density functional theory have been used to study the unique behavior of these systems. A detailed comparison of the behavior of Au/\xce\xb2-Mo2C and Au/\xce\xb4-MoC catalysts provides evidence of the impact of the metal/carbon ratio in the carbide on the performance of the catalysts. The present results show that this ratio governs the chemical behavior of the carbide and the properties of the admetal, up to the point of being able to switch the rate and mechanism of the process for CO2 conversion. A control of the metal/carbon ratio paves the road for an efficient reutilization of this environmental harmful greenhouse gas."
"Photon-powered charge separation is achieved in a supramolecular architecture based on the dense packing of functional building blocks. Therefore, self-assembled dimers of interpenetrated coordination cages consisting of redoxactive chromophors were synthesized in a single assembly step starting from easily accessible ligands and Pd(II) cations. Two backbones consisting of electron rich phenothiazine (PTZ) and electron deficient anthraquinone (ANQ) were used to assemble either homo-octameric or mixed-ligand double cages. The electrochemical and spectroscopic properties of the pure cages, mixtures of donor and acceptor cages and the mixed-ligand cages were compared by steady-state UV\xe2\x80\x93vis and transient absorption spectroscopy, supported by cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemistry. Only the mixed-ligand cages, allowing close intra-assembly communication between the donors and acceptors, showed the evolution of characteristic PTZ radical cation and ANQ radical anion features upon excitation in the transient spectra. In contrast, excitation of the mixtures of the homo-octameric donor and acceptor cages in solution did not lead to any signs of electron transfer. Densely packed photo- and redox-functional self-assemblies promise molecular-level control over the morphology of the charge separation layer in future photovoltaic applications."
"The results of a systematic investigation of trisradical tricationic complexes formed between cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) bisradical dicationic (CBPQT2(\xe2\x80\xa2+)) rings and a series of 18 dumbbells, containing centrally located 4,4\xe2\x80\xb2-bipyridinium radical cationic (BIPY\xe2\x80\xa2+) units within oligomethylene chains terminated for the most part by charged 3,5-dimethylpyridinium (PY+) and/or neutral 3,5-dimethylphenyl (PH) groups, are reported. The complexes were obtained by treating equimolar amounts of the CBPQT4+ ring and the dumbbells containing BIPY2+ units with zinc dust in acetonitrile solutions. Whereas UV\xe2\x80\x93Vis\xe2\x80\x93NIR spectra revealed absorption bands centered on ca. 1100 nm with quite different intensities for the 1:1 complexes depending on the constitutions and charges on the dumbbells, titration experiments showed that the association constants (Ka) for complex formation vary over a wide range, from 800 M\xe2\x80\x931 for the weakest to 180\xe2\x80\xaf000 M\xe2\x80\x931 for the strongest. While Coulombic repulsions emanating from PY+ groups located at the ends of some of the dumbbells undoubtedly contribute to the destabilization of the trisradical tricationic complexes, solid-state superstructures support the contention that those dumbbells with neutral PH groups at the ends of flexible and appropriately constituted links to the BIPY\xe2\x80\xa2+ units stand to gain some additional stabilization from C\xe2\x80\x93H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xcf\x80 interactions between the CBPQT2(\xe2\x80\xa2+) rings and the PH termini on the dumbbells. The findings reported in this Article demonstrate how structural changes implemented remotely from the BIPY\xe2\x80\xa2+ units influence their non-covalent bonding interactions with CBPQT2(\xe2\x80\xa2+) rings. Different secondary effects (Coulombic repulsions versus C\xe2\x80\x93H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xcf\x80 interactions) are uncovered, and their contributions to both binding strengths associated with trisradical interactions and the kinetics of associations and dissociations are discussed at some length, supported by extensive DFT calculations at the M06-D3 level. A fundamental understanding of molecular recognition in radical complexes has relevance when it comes to the design and synthesis of non-equilibrium systems."
"Gated ion transport across biological membranes is an intrinsic process regulated by protein channels. Synthetic anion carriers (anionophores) have potential applications in biological research; however, previously reported examples are mostly nonspecific, capable of mediating both electrogenic and electroneutral (nonelectrogenic) transport processes. Here we show the transmembrane Cl\xe2\x80\x93 transport studies of synthetic phenylthiosemicarbazones mimicking the function of acid-sensing (proton-gated) ion channels. These anionophores have remarkable pH-switchable transport properties with up to 640-fold increase in transport efficacy on going from pH 7.2 to 4.0. This \xe2\x80\x9cgated\xe2\x80\x9d process is triggered by protonation of the imino nitrogen and concomitant conformational change of the anion-binding thiourea moiety from anti to syn. By using a combination of two cationophore-coupled transport assays, with either monensin or valinomycin, we have elucidated the fundamental transport mechanism of phenylthiosemicarbazones which is shown to be nonelectrogenic, inseparable H+/Cl\xe2\x80\x93 cotransport. This study demonstrates the first examples of pH-switchable nonelectrogenic anion transporters."
"A large variety of molecular cobalt complexes are used as electrocatalysts for H2 production, but the key cobalt hydride intermediates are frequently difficult to detect and characterize due to their high reactivity. We report that a combination of variable scan rate cyclic voltammetry and foot-of-the-wave analysis (FOWA) can be used to detect transient CoIIIH and CoIIH intermediates of electrocatalytic H2 production by [CoII(PtBu2NPh2)(CH3CN)3]2+ and CoII(dmgBF2)2(CH3CN)2. In both cases, reduction of a transient catalytic intermediate occurs at a potential that coincides with the CoII/I couple. Each reduction displays quasireversible electron-transfer kinetics, consistent with reduction of a CoIIIH intermediate to CoIIH, which is then protonated by acid to generate H2. A bridge-protonated CoI species was ruled out as a catalytic intermediate for CoII(dmgBF2)2(CH3CN)2 from voltammograms recorded at 1000 psi of H2. Density functional theory was used to calculate CoIII\xe2\x80\x93H and CoII\xe2\x80\x93H bond strengths for both catalysts. Despite having very different ligands, the cobalt hydrides of both catalysts possess nearly identical heterolytic and homolytic Co\xe2\x80\x93H bond strengths for the CoIIIH and CoIIH intermediates."
"Ruthenium-catalyzed C\xe2\x80\x93H nitration of 2-aryl N-arenes is shown to occur with exclusive meta-selectivity, useful in the synthesis of pharmaceutical molecules."
"The understanding of the negative thermal expansion (NTE) mechanism remains challenging but critical for the development of NTE materials. This study sheds light on NTE of ScF3, one of the most outstanding materials with NTE. The local dynamics of ScF3 has been investigated by a combined analysis of synchrotron-based X-ray total scattering, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and neutron powder diffraction. Very interestingly, we observe that (i) the Sc\xe2\x80\x93F nearest-neighbor distance strongly expands with increasing temperature, while the Sc\xe2\x80\x93Sc next-nearest-neighbor distance contracts, (ii) the thermal ellipsoids of relative vibrations between Sc\xe2\x80\x93F nearest-neighbors are highly elongated in the direction perpendicular to the Sc\xe2\x80\x93F bond, indicating that the Sc\xe2\x80\x93F bond is much softer to bend than to stretch, and (iii) there is mainly dynamically transverse motion of fluorine atoms, rather than static shifts. These results are direct experimental evidence for the NTE mechanism, in which the rigid unit is not necessary for the occurrence of NTE, and the key role is played by the transverse thermal vibrations of fluorine atoms through the \xe2\x80\x9cguitar-string\xe2\x80\x9d effect."
Roseoflavin is a naturally occurring riboflavin analogue with antibiotic properties. It is biosynthesized from riboflavin in a reaction involving replacement of the C8 methyl with a dimethylamino group. Herein we report the identification of a flavin-dependent enzyme that converts flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and glutamate to 8-amino-FMN via the intermediacy of 8-formyl-FMN. A mechanistic proposal for this remarkable transformation is proposed.
"The amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease (AD) comprise fibrillar amyloid-\xce\xb2 (A\xce\xb2) peptides as well as non-protein factors including glycosaminoglycan (GAG) polysaccharides. GAGs affect the kinetics and pathway of A\xce\xb2 self-assembly and can impede fibril clearance; thus, they may be accessory molecules in AD. Here we report the first high-resolution details of GAG\xe2\x80\x93A\xce\xb2 fibril interactions from the perspective of the saccharide. Binding analysis indicated that the GAG proxy heparin has a remarkably high affinity for A\xce\xb2 fibrils with 3-fold cross-sectional symmetry (3Q). Chemical synthesis of a uniformly 13C-labeled octasaccharide heparin analogue enabled magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR of the GAG bound to 3Q fibrils, and measurements of dynamics revealed a tight complex in which all saccharide residues are restrained without undergoing substantial conformational changes. Intramolecular 13C\xe2\x80\x9315N dipolar dephasing is consistent with close (<5 \xc3\x85) contact between GAG anomeric position(s) and one or more histidine residues in the fibrils. These data provide a detailed model for the interaction between 3Q-seeded A\xce\xb240 fibrils and a major non-protein component of AD plaques, and they reveal that GAG\xe2\x80\x93amyloid interactions display a range of affinities that critically depend on the precise details of the fibril architecture."
"We propose a structure-based protocol for the development of customized covalent inhibitors. Starting from a known inhibitor, in the first and second steps appropriate substituents of the warhead are selected on the basis of quantum mechanical (QM) computations and hybrid approaches combining QM with molecular mechanics (QM/MM). In the third step the recognition unit is optimized using docking approaches for the noncovalent complex. These predictions are finally verified by QM/MM or molecular dynamic simulations. The applicability of our approach is successfully demonstrated by the design of reversible covalent vinylsulfone-based inhibitors for rhodesain. The examples show that our approach is sufficiently accurate to identify compounds with the desired properties but also to exclude nonpromising ones."
"Postsynthetic ion exchange of [Co2(\xce\xbc-Cl)2(btta)] (MAF-X27-Cl, H2bbta =1H,5H-benzo(1,2-d:4,5-d\xe2\x80\xb2)bistriazole) possessing open metal sites on its pore surface yields a material [Co2(\xce\xbc-OH)2(bbta)] (MAF-X27-OH) functionalized by both open metal sites and hydroxide ligands, giving drastically improved electrocatalytic activities for the oxygen evolution reaction (an overpotential of 292 mV at 10.0 mA cm\xe2\x80\x932 in 1.0 M KOH solution). Isotope tracing experiments further confirm that the hydroxide ligands are involved in the OER process to provide a low-energy intraframework coupling pathway."
"We describe an efficient and mild method for the synthesis of macrocyclic peptides via nitrogen arylation from unprotected precursors. Various electrophiles and lysine-based nucleophiles were investigated and showed high-yielding product formation, even for a macrocyclization scan with 14 variants. We found that nitrogen-linked aryl products were more stable to base and oxidation when compared to thiol arylated species, thereby highlighting the utility of this methodology. Finally, N-aryl macrocyclization was performed on a p53 peptide inhibitor of MDM2 and resulted in identification of a nanomolar binder with improved proteolytic stability and cell permeability."
"Oxidation from alcohols to carboxylic acids, a class of essential chemicals in daily life, academic laboratories, and industry, is a fundamental reaction, usually using at least a stoichiometric amount of an expensive and toxic oxidant. Here, an efficient and practical sustainable oxidation technology of alcohols to carboxylic acids using pure O2 or even O2 in air as the oxidant has been developed: utilizing a catalytic amount each of Fe(NO3)3\xc2\xb79H2O/TEMPO/MCl, a series of carboxylic acids were obtained from alcohols (also aldehydes) in high yields at room temperature. A 55 g-scale reaction was demonstrated using air. As a synthetic application, the first total synthesis of a naturally occurring allene, i.e., phlomic acid, was accomplished."
"The synthesis of \xce\xb1-amino carbonyl/carboxyl compounds is a contemporary challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, we present a stereoselective \xce\xb1-amination of amides employing simple azides that proceeds under mild conditions with release of nitrogen gas. The amide is used as the limiting reagent, and through simple variation of the azide pattern, various differently substituted aminated products can be obtained. The reaction is fully chemoselective for amides even in the presence of esters or ketones and lends itself to preparation of optically enriched products."
"The design of enzyme-like complexity within metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs) requires multiple reactions to be performed on a MOF crystal without losing access to its interior. Here, we show that seven post-synthetic reactions can be successfully achieved within the pores of a multivariate MOF, MTV-IRMOF-74-III, to covalently incorporate tripeptides that resemble the active sites of enzymes in their spatial arrangement and compositional heterogeneity. These reactions build up H2N-Pro-Gly-Ala-CONHL and H2N-Cys-His-Asp-CONHL (where L = organic struts) amino acid sequences by covalently attaching them to the organic struts in the MOFs, without losing porosity or crystallinity. An enabling feature of this chemistry is that the primary amine functionality (\xe2\x88\x92CH2NHBoc) of the original MOF is more reactive than the commonly examined aromatic amines (\xe2\x88\x92NH2), and this allowed for the multi-step reactions to be carried out in tandem within the MOF. Preliminary findings indicate that the complexity thus achieved can affect reactions that were previously accomplished only in the presence of enzymes."
"A room-temperature stable (phosphino)-phosphinidene reacts with carbon monoxide, stable singlet carbenes, including the poor \xcf\x80-accepting imidazol-2-ylidene, and phosphines giving rise to the corresponding phosphaketene, phosphinidene-carbene and phosphinidene-phosphine adducts, respectively. Whereas the electronic ground-state calculations indicate a PP multiple bond character in which the terminal phosphorus is negatively charged, the observed reactivity clearly indicates that (phosphino)phosphinidenes are electrophilic as expected for an electron-deficient species. This is further demonstrated by competition experiments as well as by the results of Fukui function calculations."
"The first copper-catalyzed asymmetric decarboxylative [4 + 1] cycloaddition of propargylic carbamates and sulfur ylides was successfully developed. This strategy led to a series of chiral indolines with synthetically flexible alkyne groups in good yields and with high enantio- and diastereoselectivities (up to 99% yield, 98% ee, and >95:5 dr). A possible mechanism and stereoinduction mode with copper\xe2\x80\x93allenylidenes were proposed as the possible dipolar intermediate."
"Total synthetic approaches of fullerenes are the holy grail for organic chemistry. So far, the main attempts have focused on the synthesis of the buckminsterfullerene C60. In contrast, access to subunits of the homologue C70 remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate an efficient bottom-up strategy toward a novel bowl-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) C34 with two pentagons. This PAH represents a subunit for C70 and of other higher fullerenes. The bowl-shaped structure was unambiguously determined by X-ray crystallography. A bowl-to-bowl inversion for a C70 fragment in solution was investigated by dynamic NMR analysis, showing a bowl-to-bowl inversion energy (\xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7) of 16.7 kcal mol\xe2\x80\x931, which is further corroborated by DFT calculations."
Molecular Borromean rings (BRs) is one of the rare topology among interlocked molecules. Template-free synthesis of BRs via coordination-driven self-assembly of tetracene-based Ru(II) acceptor and ditopic pyridyl donors is reported. NMR and single-crystal XRD analysis observed sequential transformation of a fully characterized monomeric rectangle to molecular BRs and vice versa. Crystal structure of BRs revealed that the particular topology was enforced by the appropriate geometry of the metallacycle and multiple parallel-displaced \xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93\xcf\x80 interactions between the donor and tetracene moiety of the acceptor. Computational studies based on density functional theory also supported the formation of BRs through dispersive intermolecular interactions in solution.
"Detailed in this Communication is the enantioselective synthesis of 1,1-diarylalkanes, a structure found in a range of pharmaceutical drug agents and natural products, through the employment of copper(I) hydride and palladium catalysis. Judicious choice of ligand for both Cu and Pd enabled this hydroarylation protocol to work for an extensive array of aryl bromides and styrenes, including \xce\xb2-substituted vinylarenes and six-membered heterocycles, under relatively mild conditions."
"Many natural products, including vinblastine, have not been easily subjected to simplifications in their structures by synthetic means or modifications by late-stage semisynthetic derivatization in ways that enhance their biological potency. Herein, we detail a synthetic vinblastine that incorporates added benign complexity (ABC), which improves activity 10-fold, and is now accessible as a result of advances in the total synthesis of the natural product. The compound incorporates designed added molecular complexity but no new functional groups and maintains all existing structural and conformational features of the natural product. It constitutes a member of an analogue class presently inaccessible by semisynthetic derivatization of the natural product, by its late-stage functionalization, or by biosynthetic means. Rather, it was accessed by synthetic means, using an appropriately modified powerful penultimate single-step vindoline\xe2\x80\x93catharanthine coupling strategy that proceeds with a higher diastereoselectivity than found for the natural product itself."
"Two non-interpenetrated zirconium metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs), NPF-200 and NPF-201, were synthesized via the assembly of elongated tetrahedral linkers with Zr6 and Zr8 clusters. They represent the first examples of MOFs to have the \xce\xb2-UH3-like, 4,12,12T1 topology. Upon activation, NPF-200 exhibits the largest BET surface area (5463 m2 g\xe2\x80\x931) and void volume (81.6%) among all MOFs formed from tetrahedral ligands. Composed of negative-charged boron-centered tetrahedral linkers, NPF-201 is an anionic Zr-MOF which selectively uptakes photoactive [Ru(bpy)3]2+ for heterogeneous photo-oxidation of thioanisole."
"The use of stoichiometric Ag(I)-salts as additives in Pd-catalyzed C\xe2\x80\x93H functionalization reactions is widespread. It is commonly proposed that this additive acts as an oxidant or as a halide scavenger promoting Pd-catalyst turnover. We demonstrate that, contrary to current proposals, phosphine ligated Ag(I)-carboxylates can efficiently carry out C\xe2\x80\x93H activation on electron-deficient arenes. We show through a combination of stoichiometric and kinetic studies that a (PPh3)Ag-carboxylate is responsible for the C\xe2\x80\x93H activation step in the Pd-catalyzed arylation of Cr(CO)3-complexed fluorobenzene. Furthermore, the reaction rate is controlled by the rate of Ag(I)-C\xe2\x80\x93H activation, leading to an order zero on the Pd-catalyst. H/D scrambling studies indicate that this Ag(I) complex can carry out C\xe2\x80\x93H activation on a variety of aromatic compounds traditionally used in Pd/Ag-mediated C\xe2\x80\x93H functionalization methodologies."
"We report that l-threonine may substitute for l-serine in the \xce\xb2-substitution reaction of an engineered subunit of tryptophan synthase from Pyrococcus furiosus, yielding (2S,3S)-\xce\xb2-methyltryptophan (\xce\xb2-MeTrp) in a single step. The trace activity of the wild-type \xce\xb2-subunit on this substrate was enhanced more than 1000-fold by directed evolution. Structural and spectroscopic data indicate that this increase is correlated with stabilization of the electrophilic aminoacrylate intermediate. The engineered biocatalyst also reacts with a variety of indole analogues and thiophenol for diastereoselective C\xe2\x80\x93C, C\xe2\x80\x93N, and C\xe2\x80\x93S bond-forming reactions. This new activity circumvents the 3-enzyme pathway that produces \xce\xb2-MeTrp in nature and offers a simple and expandable route to preparing derivatives of this valuable building block."
"Synthetic macromolecular MUC1 glycopeptides have been used to unravel molecular mechanisms in antibody recognition of disease-specific epitopes. We have established a novel synthetic strategy for MUC1 tandem repeats having complex O-glycosylation states at each repeating unit based on convergent solid-phase fragment condensation under microwave irradiation. We have accomplished the synthesis of 77 amino acid MUC1 glycopeptides (MW = 12\xe2\x80\xaf759) having three major antigenic O-glycoforms [Tn, core 1 (T), and core 2 structures] at 10 designated positions out of 19 potential O-glycosylation sites. We demonstrate that the macromolecular MUC1 glycopeptide displaying the essential glycopeptidic neoepitope Pro-Asp-Thr(sialyl-T)-Arg-Pro-Ala-Pro at two different tandem repeats is an excellent serum MUC1 model showing ideal stoichiometric binding with anti-KL6/MUC1 antibody in the sandwich ELISA to quantify human serum KL6/MUC1 levels as a critical biomarker of interstitial lung diseases."
"Metal\xe2\x80\x93ligand cooperation between iridium(III) and a 1,3-N,O-chelating phosphoramidate ligand has been used to develop a protocol for the intermolecular O-phosphoramidation of 1-alkynes. This selective C\xe2\x80\x93O bond-forming reaction differs from that of standard amidation reactions, highlighting the ability to control N- or O-functionalization based on judicious choice of N,O-chelating ligand and metal center. Advances toward the development of catalytic anti-Markovnikov O-phosphoramidation using iridium(III), including characterization of rare reactive intermediates that invoke 1,3-bidentate donor ligand hemilability, are disclosed."
"Electrochemical oxidation of toluene derivatives in the presence of a sulfilimine gave benzylaminosulfonium ions as stabilized benzyl cation pools, which reacted with subsequently added aromatic nucleophiles to give the corresponding cross-coupling products. The transformation serves as a powerful metal- and chemical-oxidant-free method for benzylic C\xe2\x80\x93H/aromatic C\xe2\x80\x93H cross-coupling. The method has been successfully applied to synthesis of TP27, an inhibitor of PTPase."
"A powerful strategy for the regioselective bidirectional synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted ketones is described, relying on the fact that the exchange of a xanthate is much faster than the radical addition to an unactivated alkene. The use of an alkene as the formal \xe2\x80\x9calkylating\xe2\x80\x9d agent associated with the tolerance for numerous functional groups and the mildness of the experimental conditions removes many of the problems associated with the classical ionic and transition-metal-based approaches."
"We report herein a simple, additive- and metal-free, photoinduced, dual C\xe2\x80\x93H/C\xe2\x80\x93X borylation of chloro-, bromo-, and iodoarenes. The reaction produces 1,2- and 1,3-diborylarenes on gram scales under batch and continuous flow conditions. The regioselectivity of the dual C\xe2\x80\x93H/C\xe2\x80\x93X borylation is determined by the solvent and the substituents in the parent haloarenes."
"The synchronization of native state motions as they transition between microstates influences catalysis kinetics, mediates allosteric interactions, and reduces the conformational entropy of proteins. However, it has proven difficult to describe native microstates because they are usually minimally frustrated and may interconvert on the micro- to millisecond time scale. Direct observation of concerted equilibrium fluctuations would therefore be an important tool for describing protein native states. Here we propose a strategy that relates NMR cross-correlated relaxation (CCR) rates between dipolar interactions to residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) of individual consecutive HN\xe2\x80\x93N and H\xce\xb1\xe2\x80\x93C\xce\xb1 bonds, which act as a proxy for the peptide planes and the side chains, respectively. Using Xplor-NIH ensemble structure calculations restrained with the RDC and CCR data, we observe collective motions on time scales slower than nanoseconds in the backbone for GB3. To directly access the correlations from CCR, we develop a structure-free data analysis. The resulting dynamic correlation map is consistent with the ensemble-restrained simulations and reveals a complex network. In general, we find that the bond motions are on average slightly correlated and that the local environment dominates many observations. Despite this, some patterns are typical over entire secondary structure elements. In the \xce\xb2-sheet, nearly all bonds are weakly correlated, and there is an approximately binary alternation in correlation intensity corresponding to the solvent exposure/shielding alternation of the side chains. For \xce\xb1-helices, there is also a weak correlation in the HN\xe2\x80\x93N bonds. The degree of correlation involving H\xce\xb1\xe2\x80\x93C\xce\xb1 bonds is directly affected by side-chain fluctuations, whereas loops show complex and nonuniform behavior."
"The molecular and ensemble dynamics for the growth of hierarchical supercrystals of cobalt nanorods have been studied by in situ tandem X-ray absorption spectroscopy\xe2\x80\x93small-angle X-ray scattering (XAS-SAXS). The supercrystals were obtained by reducing a Co(II) precursor under H2 in the presence of a long-chain amine and a long-chain carboxylic acid. Complementary time-dependent ex situ TEM studies were also performed. The experimental data provide critical insights into the nanorod growth mechanism and unequivocal evidence for a concerted growth\xe2\x80\x93organization process. Nanorod formation involves cobalt nucleation, a fast atom-by-atom anisotropic growth, and a slower oriented attachment process that continues well after cobalt reduction is complete. Smectic-like ordering of the nanorods appears very early in the process, as soon as nanoparticle elongation appears, and nanorod growth takes place inside organized superlattices, which can be regarded as mesocrystals."
"Ruthenium-based compounds are potential candidates for use as anticancer metallodrugs. The central ruthenium atom can be in the oxidation state +2 (e.g., RAPTA, RAED) or +3 (e.g., NAMI, KP). In this study we focus on paramagnetic NAMI analogs of a general structure [4-R-pyH]+trans-[RuIIICl4(DMSO)(4-R-py)]\xe2\x88\x92, where 4-R-py stands for a 4-substituted pyridine. As paramagnetic systems are generally considered difficult to characterize in detail by NMR spectroscopy, we performed a systematic structural and methodological NMR study of complexes containing variously substituted pyridines. The effect of the paramagnetic nature of these complexes on the 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts was systematically investigated by temperature-dependent NMR experiments and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. To understand the electronic factors influencing the orbital (\xce\xb4orb, temperature-independent) and paramagnetic (\xce\xb4para, temperature-dependent) contributions to the total NMR chemical shifts, a relativistic two-component DFT approach was used. The paramagnetic contributions to the 13C NMR chemical shifts are correlated with the distribution of spin density in the ligand moiety and the 13C isotropic hyperfine coupling constants, Aiso(13C), for the individual carbon atoms. To analyze the mechanism of spin distribution in the ligand, the contributions of molecular spin\xe2\x80\x93orbitals (MSOs) to the hyperfine coupling constants and the spatial distribution of the z-component of the spin density in the MSOs calculated at the relativistic four-component DFT level are discussed and rationalized. The significant effects of the substituent and the solvent on \xce\xb4para, particularly the contact contribution, are demonstrated. This work should contribute to further understanding of the link between the electronic structure and the NMR chemical shifts in open-shell systems, including the ruthenium-based metallodrugs investigated in this account."
"We report the electrochemical detection of femtomolar amounts of cobalt, iridium, nickel, and iron ions in solution by electrocatalyst formation and amplification. The metal oxides of these ions can be formed electrochemically and can catalyze the oxidation of water. Alternatively, the reduction of metal ions to metals, such as the reduction of IrCl63\xe2\x80\x93 to iridium, is capable of electrocatalytically reducing protons to molecular hydrogen, as shown previously with Pt. These events, which manifest themselves in amperometry, correspond to the formation of electrocatalytic nuclei on the electrode surface, capable of electrocatalytically oxidizing water or reducing protons. An analysis of the frequency of anodic blips compared to theory implies that the requirement for water oxidation is 10 \xc2\xb1 1 ions of cobalt, 13 \xc2\xb1 4 ions of iridium, and 11 \xc2\xb1 3 ions of nickel. A similar analysis for iridium reduction and the corresponding catalytic reduction of protons implies that 6 \xc2\xb1 2 ions of iridium are required for proton reduction. These numbers are confirmed in an analysis of the time of first nucleation event, i.e. the time at which the first blip on the amperometric i\xe2\x80\x93t experiment occurs. We further show that the anodic blips in detecting nickel increase in intensity upon increasing amounts of iron ions in solution to a ratio of Ni/Fe of \xe2\x88\xbc5, surprisingly close to that for bulk electrocatalysts of Ni\xe2\x80\x93Fe."
"Vacancy-ordered double perovskites of the general formula A2BX6 are a family of perovskite derivatives composed of a face-centered lattice of nearly isolated [BX6] units with A-site cations occupying the cuboctahedral voids. Despite the presence of isolated octahedral units, the close-packed iodide lattice provides significant electronic dispersion, such that Cs2SnI6 has recently been explored for applications in photovoltaic devices. To elucidate the structure\xe2\x80\x93property relationships of these materials, we have synthesized solid-solution Cs2Sn1\xe2\x80\x93xTexI6. However, even though tellurium substitution increases electronic dispersion via closer I\xe2\x80\x93I contact distances, the substitution experimentally yields insulating behavior from a significant decrease in carrier concentration and mobility. Density functional calculations of native defects in Cs2SnI6 reveal that iodine vacancies exhibit a low enthalpy of formation, and that the defect energy level is a shallow donor to the conduction band rendering the material tolerant to these defect states. The increased covalency of Te\xe2\x80\x93I bonding renders the formation of iodine vacancy states unfavorable and is responsible for the reduction in conductivity upon Te substitution. Additionally, Cs2TeI6 is intolerant to the formation of these defects, because the defect level occurs deep within the band gap and thus localizes potential mobile charge carriers. In these vacancy-ordered double perovskites, the close-packed lattice of iodine provides significant electronic dispersion, while the interaction of the B- and X-site ions dictates the properties as they pertain to electronic structure and defect tolerance. This simplified perspective based on extensive experimental and theoretical analysis provides a platform from which to understand structure\xe2\x80\x93property relationships in functional perovskite halides"
"We report on an approach to realize carbon\xe2\x80\x93gold (C\xe2\x80\x93Au) bonded molecular junctions without the need for an additive to deprotect the alkynyl carbon as endstanding anchor group. Using the mechanically controlled break junction (MCBJ) technique, we determine the most probable conductance value of a family of alkynyl terminated oligophenylenes (OPA(n)) connected to gold electrodes through such an akynyl moiety in ambient conditions. The molecules bind to the gold leads through an sp-hybridized carbon atom at each side. Comparing our results with other families of molecules that present organometallic C\xe2\x80\x93Au bonds, we conclude that the conductance of molecules contacted via an sp-hybridized carbon atom is lower than the ones using sp3 hybridization due to strong differences in the coupling of the conducting orbitals with the gold leads."
"The first example of transition metal-catalyzed meta-selective CAr\xe2\x80\x93H nitration of arenes is described. With the use of Ru3(CO)12 as the catalyst and Cu(NO3)2\xc2\xb73H2O as the nitro source, a wide spectrum of arenes bearing diversified N-heterocycles or oximido as the directing groups were nitrated with meta-selectivity exclusively. Mechanism studies have demonstrated the formation of a new 18e-octahedral ruthenium species as a key ortho-CAr\xe2\x80\x93H metalated intermediate, which may be responsible for the subsequent meta-selective electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr). Moreover, this approach provides a fast-track strategy for atom/step economical synthesis of many useful pharmaceutical molecules."
"Enzymes in the sulfur network generate the signaling molecule, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), from the amino acids cysteine and homocysteine. Since it is toxic at elevated concentrations, cells are equipped to clear H2S. A canonical sulfide oxidation pathway operates in mitochondria, converting H2S to thiosulfate and sulfate. We have recently discovered the ability of ferric hemoglobin to oxidize sulfide to thiosulfate and iron-bound hydropolysulfides. In this study, we report that myoglobin exhibits a similar capacity for sulfide oxidation. We have trapped and characterized iron-bound sulfur intermediates using cryo-mass spectrometry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Further support for the postulated intermediates in the chemically challenging conversion of H2S to thiosulfate and iron-bound catenated sulfur products is provided by EPR and resonance Raman spectroscopy in addition to density functional theory computational results. We speculate that the unusual sensitivity of skeletal muscle cytochrome c oxidase to sulfide poisoning in ethylmalonic encephalopathy, resulting from the deficiency in a mitochondrial sulfide oxidation enzyme, might be due to the concentration of H2S by myoglobin in this tissue."
"The iron(IV)\xe2\x80\x93oxo (ferryl) intermediate has been amply established as the principal oxidant in nonheme enzymes and the key player in C\xe2\x80\x93H bond activations and functionalizations. In contrast to this status, our present QM/MM calculations of the mechanism of fosfomycin biosynthesis (a broad range antibiotic) by the nonheme HppE enzyme rule out the iron(IV)\xe2\x80\x93oxo as the reactive species in the hydrogen abstraction (H-abstraction) step of the pro-R hydrogen from the (S)-2-hydroxypropylphosphonic substrate. Moreover, the study reveals that the ferryl species is bypassed in HppE, while the actual oxidant is an HO\xe2\x80\xa2 radical hydrogen-bonded to a ferric-hydroxo complex, resulting via the homolytic dissociation of the hydrogen peroxide complex, Fe(II)\xe2\x80\x93H2O2. The computed energy barrier of this pathway is 12.0 kcal/mol, in fair agreement with the experimental datum of 9.8 kcal/mol. An alternative mechanism involves the iron-complexed hydroxyl radical (FeIII\xe2\x80\x93(HO\xe2\x80\xa2)) that is obtained by protonation of the iron(IV)\xe2\x80\x93oxo group via the O\xe2\x80\x93H group of the substrate. The barrier for this pathway, 23.0 kcal/mol, is higher than the one in the first mechanism. In both mechanisms, the HO\xe2\x80\xa2 radical is highly selective; its H-abstraction leading to the final cis-fosfomycin product. It appears that HppE is prone to usage of HO\xe2\x80\xa2 radicals for C\xe2\x80\x93H bond activation, because the ferryl oxidant requires a specific H-abstraction trajectory (\xe2\x88\xa0FeOH \xe2\x88\xbc 180\xc2\xb0) that cannot be met for intramolecular H-abstraction. Thus, this work broadens the landscape of nonheme iron enzymes and makes a connection to Fenton chemistry, with implications on new potential biocatalysts that may harness hydroxyl radicals for C\xe2\x80\x93H bond functionalizations."
"Exposure of DNA to chemicals can result in the formation of DNA adducts, a molecular initiating event in genotoxin-induced carcinogenesis. O6-Methylguanine (O6-MeG) is a highly mutagenic DNA adduct that forms in human genomic DNA upon reaction with methylating agents of dietary, environmental, or endogenous origin. In this work, we report the design and synthesis of novel non-natural nucleoside analogues 1\xe2\x80\xb2-\xce\xb2-[1-naphtho[2,3-d]imidazol-2(3H)-one)]-2\xe2\x80\xb2-deoxy-d-ribofuranose and 1\xe2\x80\xb2-\xce\xb2-[1-naphtho[2,3-d]imidazole]-2\xe2\x80\xb2-deoxy-d-ribofuranose and their use for quantifying O6-MeG within mutational hotspots of the human KRAS gene. The novel nucleoside analogues were incorporated into oligonucleotides conjugated to gold nanoparticles to comprise a DNA hybridization probe system for detecting O6-MeG in a sequence-specific manner on the basis of colorimetric readout of the nanoparticles. The concept described herein is unique in utilizing new nucleoside analogues with elongated hydrophobic surfaces to successfully measure in-gene abundance of O6-MeG in mixtures with competing unmodified DNA."
"We describe the encapsulation of mobile proton carriers into defect sites in nonporous coordination polymers (CPs). The proton carriers were encapsulated with high mobility and provided high proton conductivity at 150 \xc2\xb0C under anhydrous conditions. The high proton conductivity and nonporous nature of the CP allowed its application as an electrolyte in a fuel cell. The defects and mobile proton carriers were investigated using solid-state NMR, XAFS, XRD, and ICP-AES/EA. On the basis of these analyses, we concluded that the defect sites provide space for mobile uncoordinated H3PO4, H2PO4\xe2\x80\x93, and H2O. These mobile carriers play a key role in expanding the proton-hopping path and promoting the mobility of protons in the coordination framework, leading to high proton conductivity and fuel cell power generation."
"Protein binding to DNA changes the DNA\xe2\x80\x99s structure, and altered DNA structure can, in turn, modulate the dynamics of protein binding. This mutual dependency is poorly understood. Here we investigated dynamic couplings among protein binding to DNA, protein sliding on DNA, and DNA bending by applying a coarse-grained simulation method to the bacterial architectural protein HU and 14 other DNA-binding proteins. First, we verified our method by showing that the simulated HU exhibits a weak preference for A/T-rich regions of DNA and a much higher affinity for gapped and nicked DNA, consistent with biochemical experiments. The high affinity was attributed to a local DNA bend, but not the specific chemical moiety of the gap/nick. The long-time dynamic analysis revealed that HU sliding is associated with the movement of the local DNA bending site. Deciphering single sliding steps, we found the coupling between HU sliding and DNA bending is akin to neither induced-fit nor population-shift; instead they moved concomitantly. This is reminiscent of a cation transfer on DNA and can be viewed as a protein version of polaron-like sliding. Interestingly, on shorter time scales, HU paused when the DNA was highly bent at the bound position and escaped from pauses once the DNA spontaneously returned to a less bent structure. The HU sliding is largely regulated by DNA bending dynamics. With 14 other proteins, we explored the generality and versatility of the dynamic coupling and found that 6 of the 15 assayed proteins exhibit the polaron-like sliding."
"A mononuclear non-heme manganese(V)\xe2\x80\x93oxo complex, [MnV(O)(TAML)]\xe2\x88\x92 (1), was synthesized by activating dioxygen in the presence of olefins with weak allylic C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds and characterized structurally and spectroscopically. In mechanistic studies, the formation rate of 1 was found to depend on the allylic C\xe2\x80\x93H bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of olefins, and a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) value of 16 was obtained in the reactions of cyclohexene and cyclohexene-d10. These results suggest that a hydrogen atom abstraction from the allylic C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds of olefins by a putative MnIV\xe2\x80\x93superoxo species, which is formed by binding O2 by a high-spin (S = 2) [MnIII(TAML)]\xe2\x88\x92 complex, is the rate-determining step. A Mn(V)\xe2\x80\x93oxo complex binding Sc3+ ion, [MnV(O)(TAML)]\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x93(Sc3+) (2), was also synthesized in the reaction of 1 with Sc3+ ion and then characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. The binding site of the Sc3+ ion was proposed to be the TAML ligand, not the Mn\xe2\x80\x93O moiety, probably due to the low basicity of the oxo group compared to the basicity of the amide carbonyl group in the TAML ligand. Reactivity studies of the Mn(V)\xe2\x80\x93oxo intermediates, 1 and 2, in oxygen atom transfer and electron-transfer reactions revealed that the binding of Sc3+ ion at the TAML ligand of Mn(V)\xe2\x80\x93oxo enhanced its oxidizing power with a positively shifted one-electron reduction potential (\xce\x94Ered = 0.70 V). This study reports the first example of tuning the second coordination sphere of high-valent metal\xe2\x80\x93oxo species by binding a redox-inactive metal ion at the supporting ligand site, thereby modulating their electron-transfer properties as well as their reactivities in oxidation reactions."
"Understanding the C\xe2\x80\x93C bond activation mechanism is essential for developing the selective production of hydrocarbons in the petroleum industry and for selective polymer decomposition. In this work, ring-opening reactions of cyclopropane derivatives under hydrogen catalyzed by metal nanoparticles (NPs) in the liquid phase were studied. 40-atom rhodium (Rh) NPs, encapsulated by dendrimer molecules and supported in mesoporous silica, catalyzed the ring opening of cyclopropylbenzene at room temperature under hydrogen in benzene, and the turnover frequency (TOF) was higher than other metals or the Rh homogeneous catalyst counterparts. Comparison of reactants with various substitution groups showed that electron donation on the three-membered ring boosted the TOF of ring opening. The linear products formed with 100% selectivity for ring opening of all reactants catalyzed by the Rh NP. Surface Rh(0) acted as the active site in the NP. The capping agent played an important role in the ring-opening reaction kinetics. Larger particle size tended to show higher TOF and smaller reaction activation energy for Rh NPs encapsulated in either dendrimer or poly(vinylpyrrolidone). The generation/size of dendrimer and surface group also affected the reaction rate and activation energy."
"The HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) forms the capsid shell that encloses RNA within a mature HIV-1 virion. Previous studies by electron microscopy have shown that the capsid shell is primarily a triangular lattice of CA hexamers, with variable curvature that destroys the ideal symmetry of a planar lattice. The mature CA lattice depends on CA dimerization, which occurs through interactions between helix 9 segments of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of CA. Several high-resolution structures of the CTD-CTD dimerization interface have been reported, based on X-ray crystallography and multidimensional solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), with significant differences in amino acid side chain conformations and helix 9-helix 9 orientations. In a structural model for tubular CA assemblies based on cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) [Zhao et al. Nature, 2013, 497, 643\xe2\x80\x93646], the dimerization interface is substantially disordered. The dimerization interface structure in noncrystalline CA assemblies and the extent to which this interface is structurally ordered within a curved lattice have therefore been unclear. Here we describe solid state NMR measurements on the dimerization interface in tubular CA assemblies, which contain the curved triangular lattice of a mature virion, including quantitative measurements of intermolecular and intramolecular distances using dipolar recoupling techniques, solid state NMR chemical shifts, and long-range side chain-side chain contacts. When combined with restraints on the distance and orientation between helix 9 segments from the cryoEM study, the solid state NMR data lead to a unique high-resolution structure for the dimerization interface in the noncrystalline lattice of CA tubes. These results demonstrate that CA lattice curvature is not dependent on disorder or variability in the dimerization interface. This work also demonstrates the feasibility of local structure determination within large noncrystalline assemblies formed by high-molecular-weight proteins, using modern solid state NMR methods."
"The first neutron diffraction study of a single crystal containing uranyl peroxide nanoclusters is reported for pyrophosphate-functionalized Na44K6[(UO2)24(O2)24(P2O7)12][IO3]2\xc2\xb7140H2O (1). Relative to earlier X-ray studies, neutron diffraction provides superior information concerning the positions of H atoms and lighter counterions. Hydrogen positions have been assigned and reveal an extensive network of H-bonds; notably, most O atoms present in the anionic cluster accept H-bonds from surrounding H2O molecules, and none of the surface-bound O atoms are protonated. The D4h symmetry of the cage is consistent with the presence of six encapsulated K cations, which appear to stabilize the lower symmetry variant of this cluster. 31P NMR measurements demonstrate retention of this symmetry in solution, while in situ 31P NMR studies suggest an acid-catalyzed mechanism for the assembly of 1 across a wide range of pH values."
"The C4-bridged unsaturated phosphane/borane frustrated Lewis pairs (P/B FLPs) 4 undergo borane induced phosphane addition to a variety of acetylenic esters or ketones to generate heterocyclic 10-membered intermediates that contain pairs of allyl phosphonium/allenic enolate functionalities. These subsequently undergo phospha-Claisen type rearrangement reactions to give the respective substituted phosphanyl pentadiene products. In two exceptional cases subsequent reactions leading to anomalous phospha-Claisen products were found. One example involved cyclopropane ring formation, and the other carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon bond activation. Potential mechanistic schemes leading to these products are discussed. Essential examples were characterized by X-ray diffraction."
"Understanding the relationship between the structure and the reactivity of catalytic metal nanoparticles (NPs) is important to achieve higher efficiencies in electrocatalytic devices. A big challenge remains, however, in studying these relations at the individual NP level. To address this challenge, we developed an approach using nanometer-scale scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for the study of the geometric property and catalytic activity of individual Pt NPs in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Herein, Pt NPs with a few tens to a hundred nm radius were directly electrodeposited on a highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG) surface via nucleation and growth without the necessity of capping agents or anchoring molecules. A well-defined nanometer-sized tip comparable to the dimensions of the NPs and a stable nanogap between the tip and NPs enabled us to achieve lateral and vertical spatial resolutions at a nanometer-scale and study fast electron-transfer kinetics. Specifically, the use of two different types of redox mediators: (1) outer-sphere mediator and (2) inner-sphere mediators could differentiate between the topography and the catalytic activity of individual Pt NPs and measure a large effective rate constant of HOR, keff0 of \xe2\x89\xa52 cm/s as a lower limit at each Pt NP. Consequently, the size, shape, spatial orientation and the catalytic activity of Pt NPs could be determined at an individual level in nanoscale SECM where imaging accompanied by theoretical modeling and analysis. This approach can be easily extended to quantitatively probe the effects of the surface property, such as capping agent effects on the catalytic activity of a variety of metal NPs for the design and assessment of NP catalysts."
"We report on the eligibility of tetraphosphonate resorcinarene cavitands for the molecular recognition of amino acids. We determined the crystal structure of 13 complexes of the tetraphosphonate cavitand Tiiii[H, CH3, CH3] with amino acids. 1H NMR and 31P NMR experiments and ITC analysis were performed to probe the binding between cavitand Tiiii[C3H7, CH3, C2H5] or the water-soluble counterpart Tiiii[C3H6Py+Cl-, CH3, C2H5] and a selection of representative amino acids. The reported studies and results allowed us (i) to highlight the noncovalent interactions involved in the binding event in each case; (ii) to investigate the ability of tetraphosphonate cavitand receptors to discriminate between the different amino acids; (iii) to calculate the Ka values of the different complexes formed and evaluate the thermodynamic parameters of the complexation process, dissecting the entropic and enthalpic contributions; and (iv) to determine the solvent influence on the complexation selectivity. By moving from methanol to water, the complexation changed from entropy driven to entropy opposed, leading to a drop of almost three orders in the magnitude of the Ka. However, this reduction in binding affinity is associated with a dramatic increase in selectivity, since in aqueous solutions only N-methylated amino acids are effectively recognized. The thermodynamic profile of the binding does not change in PBS solution. The pivotal role played by cation\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interactions is demonstrated by the linear correlation found between the log\xe2\x80\xafKa in methanol solution and the depth of +N\xe2\x80\x93CH3 cavity inclusion in the molecular structures. These findings are relevant for the potential use of phosphonate cavitands as synthetic receptors for the detection of epigenetic modifications of histones in physiological media."
"To improve the interfacial charge transfer that is crucial to the performance of perovskite solar cells, the interface engineering in a device should be rationally designed. Here we have developed an interface engineering method to tune the photovoltaic performance of planar-heterojunction perovskite solar cells by incorporating MAPbBr3\xe2\x80\x93xIx (MA = CH3NH3) quantum dots (QDs) between the MAPbI3 perovskite film and the hole-transporting material (HTM) layer. By adjustment of the Br:I ratio, the as-synthesized MAPbBr3\xe2\x80\x93xIx QDs show tunable fluorescence and band edge positions. When the valence band (VB) edge of MAPbBr3\xe2\x80\x93xIx QDs is located below that of the MAPbI3 perovskite, the hole transfer from the MAPbI3 perovskite film to the HTM layer is hindered, and hence, the power conversion efficiency decreases. In contrast, when the VB edge of MAPbBr3\xe2\x80\x93xIx QDs is located between the VB edge of the MAPbI3 perovskite film and the highest occupied molecular orbital of the HTM layer, the hole transfer from the MAPbI3 perovskite film to the HTM layer is well-facilitated, resulting in significant improvements in the fill factor, short-circuit photocurrent, and power conversion efficiency."
"Herein, we report a novel cobalt-catalyzed stereodivergent transfer hydrogenation of alkynes to Z- and E-alkenes. Effective selectivity control is achieved based on a rational catalyst design. Moreover, this mild system allows for the transfer hydrogenation of alkynes bearing a wide range of functional groups in good yields using catalyst loadings as low as 0.2 mol %. The general applicability of this procedure is highlighted by the synthesis of more than 50 alkenes with good chemo- and stereoselectivity. A preliminary mechanistic study revealed that E-alkene product was generated via sequential alkyne hydrogenation to give Z-alkene intermediate, followed by a Z to E alkene isomerization process."
"A well-defined, silica-supported bimetallic precatalyst [\xe2\x89\xa1Si\xe2\x80\x93O\xe2\x80\x93W(Me)5\xe2\x89\xa1Si\xe2\x80\x93O\xe2\x80\x93Zr(Np)3] (4) has been synthesized for the first time by successively grafting two organometallic complexes [W(Me)6 (1) followed by ZrNp4 (2)] on a single silica support. Surprisingly, multiple-quantum NMR characterization demonstrates that W and Zr species are in close proximity to each other. Hydrogenation of this bimetallic catalyst at room temperature showed the easy formation of zirconium hydride, probably facilitated by tungsten hydride which was formed at this temperature. This bimetallic W/Zr hydride precatalyst proved to be more efficient (TON = 1436) than the monometallic W hydride (TON = 650) in the metathesis of n-decane at 150 \xc2\xb0C. This synergy between Zr and W suggests that the slow step of alkane metathesis is the C\xe2\x80\x93H bond activation that occurs on Zr. The produced olefin resulting from a \xce\xb2-H elimination undergoes easy metathesis on W."
"All-inorganic cesium lead halide (CsPbX3, X = Br\xe2\x80\x93, I\xe2\x80\x93) perovskites could potentially provide comparable photovoltaic performance with enhanced stability compared to organic\xe2\x80\x93inorganic lead halide species. However, small-bandgap cubic CsPbI3 has been difficult to study due to challenges forming CsPbI3 in the cubic phase. Here, a low-temperature procedure to form cubic CsPbI3 has been developed through a halide exchange reaction using films of sintered CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. The reaction was found to be strongly dependent upon temperature, featuring an Arrhenius relationship. Additionally, film thickness played a significant role in determining internal film structure at intermediate reaction times. Thin films (50 nm) showed only a small distribution of CsPbBrxI3\xe2\x80\x93x species, while thicker films (350 nm) exhibited much broader distributions. Furthermore, internal film structure was ordered, featuring a compositional gradient within film. Transient absorption spectroscopy showed the influence of halide exchange on the excited state of the material. In thicker films, charge carriers were rapidly transferred to iodide-rich regions near the film surface within the first several picoseconds after excitation. This ultrafast vectorial charge-transfer process illustrates the potential of utilizing compositional gradients to direct charge flow in perovskite-based photovoltaics."
"Graft and dendronized polymers have attracted much attention in the polymer community, and there have been significant efforts to develop better synthetic methods. Herein, we report the highly efficient synthesis of graft and dendronized polymers by using Cu-catalyzed multicomponent polymerization (MCP). Based on diversity-oriented synthesis, we prepared a library of various graft and dendronized polymers from combinations of three types of monomers (mono-functionalized alkynes, bis-sulfonyl azides, and diamines/diols) that are bench stable and readily accessible. After reaction optimization, 54 samples of high-molecular-weight graft and dendronized polymers were prepared, the MCP method allowing simultaneous manipulation of the structures of both the main chains and the side chains. Moreover, because of the severe steric hindrance of the side chains, these polymers adopted extended conformations, as shown by the large shape parameter in solution. Also, the extended morphology of the single polymer chains was directly visualized by atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy in the solid state. Most importantly, this diversity-oriented polymerization became possible because of highly step-economical and efficient one-step MCP, paving the way toward the easily tunable synthesis of graft and dendronized polymers."
"One-electron oxidation of organoboron L2PhB: 1 (L = oxazol-2-ylidene) afforded a dicationic diborane(6) species [L2PhB\xe2\x80\x93BPhL2]\xc2\xb72X (X = OTf, BF4, AlCl4) 3, representing a new strategy to construct a B(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93B(sp3) covalent bond. Each boron atom in 3 is in the formal oxidation state +II, and tetracoordinate with a Ph group and two oxazol-2-ylidenes. The cyclic voltammetry of 3 shows irreversible reduction and oxidation. Indeed, two-electron reduction of 3 with potassium graphite (KC8) afforded 1, making a fully reversible 1 \xe2\x86\x94 3 redox system, whereas two-electron oxidation with AuCl produced a boronium [L2PhBCl]OTf 4. Moreover, the reactions of 3 with isonitrile derivatives RNC: under heating conditions gave a cyano-substituted boronium [L2PhBCN]BF4 5 and a 2-boranyl-indole derivative 6, depending on the substituent R. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a borinylium radical 1\xe2\x80\xa2+ which is generated via a homolytic cleavage of the B\xe2\x80\x93B bond of 3."
"Human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is both a keto\xe2\x80\x93enol tautomerase and a cytokine associated with numerous inflammatory diseases and cancer. Consistent with observed correlations between inhibition of the enzymatic and biological activities, discovery of MIF inhibitors has focused on monitoring the tautomerase activity using l-dopachrome methyl ester or 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvic acid as substrates. The accuracy of these assays is compromised by several issues including substrate instability, spectral interference, and short linear periods for product formation. In this work, we report the syntheses of fluorescently labeled MIF inhibitors and their use in the first fluorescence polarization-based assay to measure the direct binding of inhibitors to the active site. The assay allows the accurate and efficient identification of competitive, noncompetitive, and covalent inhibitors of MIF in a manner that can be scaled for high-throughput screening. The results for 22 compounds show that the most potent MIF inhibitors bind with Kd values of ca. 50 nM; two are from our laboratory, and the other is a compound from the patent literature. X-ray crystal structures for two of the most potent compounds bound to MIF are also reported here. Striking combinations of protein\xe2\x80\x93ligand hydrogen bonding, aryl\xe2\x80\x93aryl, and cation\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interactions are responsible for the high affinities. A new chemical series was then designed using this knowledge to yield two more strong MIF inhibitors/binders."
"Surface passivation has enabled the development of silicon-based solar cells and microelectronics. However, a number of emerging applications require a paradigm shift from passivation to functionalization, wherein surface functionality is installed proximal to the silicon surface. To address this need, we report here the use of persistent aminocarbenes to functionalize hydrogen-terminated silicon surfaces via Si\xe2\x80\x93H insertion reactions. Through the use of model compounds (H\xe2\x80\x93Si(TMS)3 and H\xe2\x80\x93Si(OTMS)3), nanoparticles (H\xe2\x80\x93SiNPs), and planar Si(111) wafers (H\xe2\x80\x93Si(111)), we demonstrate that among different classes of persistent carbenes, the more electrophilic and nucleophilic ones, in particular, a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) and an acyclic diaminocarbene (ADAC), are able to undergo insertion into Si\xe2\x80\x93H bonds at the silicon surface, forming persistent C\xe2\x80\x93Si linkages and simultaneously installing amine or aminal functionality in proximity to the surface. The CAAC (6) is particularly notable for its clean insertion reactivity under mild conditions that produces monolayers with 21 \xc2\xb1 3% coverage of Si(111) atop sites, commensurate with the expected maximum of \xe2\x88\xbc20%. Atomic force and transmission electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray photoelectron, and infrared spectroscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry provided evidence for the surface Si\xe2\x80\x93H insertion process. Furthermore, computational studies shed light on the reaction energetics and indicated that CAAC 6 should be particularly effective at binding to silicon dihydride, trihydride, and coupled monohyride motifs, as well as oxidized surface sites. Our results pave the way for the further development of persistent carbenes as universal ligands for silicon and potentially other nonmetallic substrates."
"Alkali\xe2\x80\x93rare earth metal precursors to light-harvesting materials are created in a large-scale, high-yielding one-pot reaction with commonly available starting reagents at a low temperature."
"Interfacial multivalent interactions at pathogen\xe2\x80\x93cell interfaces can be competitively inhibited by multivalent scaffolds that prevent pathogen adhesion to the cells during the initial stages of infection. The lack of understanding of complex biological systems makes the design of an efficient multivalent inhibitor a toilsome task. Therefore, we have highlighted the main issues and concerns associated with blocking pathogen at interfaces, which are dependent on the nature and properties of both multivalent inhibitors and pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. The challenges associated with different cores or carrier scaffolds of multivalent inhibitors are concisely discussed with selected examples."
"Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are promising therapeutics that make use of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, but liabilities arising from the native RNA structure necessitate chemical modification for drug development. Advances in the structural characterization of components of the human RNAi pathway have enabled structure-guided optimization of siRNA properties. Here we report the 2.3 \xc3\x85 resolution crystal structure of human Argonaute 2 (hAgo2), a key nuclease in the RNAi pathway, bound to an siRNA guide strand bearing an unnatural triazolyl nucleotide at position 1 (g1). Unlike natural nucleotides, this analogue inserts deeply into hAgo2\xe2\x80\x99s central RNA binding cleft and thus is able to modulate pairing between guide and target RNAs. The affinity of the hAgo2\xe2\x80\x93siRNA complex for a seed-only matched target was significantly reduced by the triazolyl modification, while the affinity for a fully matched target was unchanged. In addition, siRNA potency for off-target repression was reduced (4-fold increase in IC50) by the modification, while on-target knockdown was improved (2-fold reduction in IC50). Controlling siRNA on-target versus microRNA (miRNA)-like off-target potency by projection of substituent groups into the hAgo2 central cleft from g1 is a new approach to enhance siRNA selectivity with a strong structural rationale."
"In this contribution we show that biological membranes can catalyze the formation of supramolecular hydrogel networks. Negatively charged lipid membranes can generate a local proton gradient, accelerating the acid-catalyzed formation of hydrazone-based supramolecular gelators near the membrane. Synthetic lipid membranes can be used to tune the physical properties of the resulting multicomponent gels as a function of lipid concentration. Moreover, the catalytic activity of lipid membranes and the formation of gel networks around these supramolecular structures are controlled by the charge and phase behavior of the lipid molecules. Finally, we show that the insights obtained from synthetic membranes can be translated to biological membranes, enabling the formation of gel fibers on living HeLa cells."
"Poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(d,l-lactic acid) (PEG-b-PLA) micelles are nanocarriers for poorly water-soluble anticancer agents and have advanced paclitaxel (PTX) to humans due to drug solubilization, biocompatibility, and dose escalation. However, PEG-b-PLA micelles rapidly release PTX, resulting in widespread biodistribution and low tumor exposure. To improve delivery of PTX by PEG-b-PLA micelles, monodisperse oligo(l-lactic acid), o(LA)8 or o(LA)16, has been coupled onto PTX at the 7-OH position, forming ester prodrugs: o(LA)8-PTX and o(LA)16-PTX, respectively. As expected, o(LA)n-PTX was more compatible with PEG-b-PLA micelles than PTX, increasing drug loading from 11 to 54%. While in vitro release of PTX was rapid, resulting in precipitation, o(LA)n-PTX release was more gradual: t1/2 = 14 and 26 h for o(LA)8-PTX and o(LA)16-PTX, respectively. Notably, o(LA)8-PTX and o(LA)16-PTX in PEG-b-PLA micelles resisted backbiting chain end scission, based on reverse-phase HPLC analysis. By contrast, o(LA)8-PTX and o(LA)16-PTX degraded substantially in 1:1 acetonitrile:10 mM PBS, pH 7.4, at 37 \xc2\xb0C, generating primarily o(LA)2-PTX. The IC50 value of o(LA)2-PTX was \xe2\x88\xbc2.3 nM for A549 human lung cancer cells, equipotent with PTX in vitro. After weekly IV injections at 20 mg/kg as PEG-b-PLA micelles, o(LA)8-PTX induced tumor regression in A549 tumor-bearing mice, whereas PTX delayed tumor growth. Surprisingly, o(LA)8-PTX caused less toxicity than PTX in terms of change in body weight. In conclusion, o(LA)n acts as a novel promoiety, undergoing backbiting conversion without a reliance on metabolizing enzymes, and o(LA)n-PTX improves PTX delivery by PEG-b-PLA micelles, providing a strong justification for clinical evaluation."
"We describe palladium-mediated S-arylation that exploits natural metal-binding motifs to ensure high site selectivity for a proximal reactive residue. This allows the chemical identification not only of proteins that bind metals but also the environment of the metal-binding site itself through proteomic analysis of arylation sites. The transformation is easy to perform under standard conditions, does not require the isolation of a reactive Ar\xe2\x80\x93Pd complex, is broad in scope, and is applicable in cell lysates as well as to covalent inhibition/modulation of metal-dependent enzymatic activity."
"Mg(PF6)2-based electrolytes for Mg-ion batteries have not received the same attention as the analogous LiPF6-based electrolytes used in most Li-ion cells owing to the perception that the PF6\xe2\x80\x93 anion decomposes on and passivates Mg electrodes. No synthesis of the Mg(PF6)2 salt has been reported, nor have its solutions been studied electrochemically. Here, we report the synthesis of the complex Mg(PF6)2(CH3CN)6 and its solution-state electrochemistry. Solutions of Mg(PF6)2(CH3CN)6 in CH3CN and CH3CN/THF mixtures exhibit high conductivities (up to 28 mS\xc2\xb7cm\xe2\x80\x931) and electrochemical stability up to at least 4 V vs Mg on Al electrodes. Contrary to established perceptions, Mg electrodes are observed to remain electrochemically active when cycled in the presence of these Mg(PF6)2-based electrolytes, with no fluoride (i.e., MgF2) formed on the Mg surface. Stainless steel electrodes are found to corrode when cycled in the presence of Mg(PF6)2 solutions, but Al electrodes are passivated. The electrolytes have been used in a prototype Mg battery with a Mg anode and Chevrel (Mo3S4)-phase cathode."
"Probes for monitoring protein aggregation with a variety of photophysical properties are of importance for the fundamental understanding of the aggregation process as well as for drug discovery. In this manuscript we report the photoluminescence response of the metal dipyridophenazine complex [Re(CO)3(dppz)(Py)]+ in the presence of aggregated A\xce\xb2. [Re(CO)3(dppz)(Py)]+ shows an instantaneous increase in photoluminescence with fibrillar A\xce\xb2 (primary light-switching), and an unprecedented further increase in photoluminescence upon light irradiation at 362 nm (secondary light switching). The total increase in photoluminescence amounts to 105-fold, which we show can be used to monitor A\xce\xb2 aggregation in real time."
"A multicomponent combinatorial polymerization method has been exploited as a new intersection between combinatorial chemistry, polymer chemistry, and organic chemistry. The tricomponent Biginelli reaction has been employed as a model multicomponent reaction (MCR) to efficiently prepare a library of polycondensates with continuously changed chain structure but different physical properties. The naturally increased reaction modules (monomers) directly doubled the number of polymers in the library, effectively improving the efficiency of polymer preparation. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of those homologous polymers have been mapped for the first time to predict the Tg values of absent polymer homologues with good to excellent accuracy. Meanwhile, the Tg maps have also been used to reveal the regular change in Tg according to the polymer structure (linking group, monomer chain length, etc.), initially suggesting the academic significance of the multicomponent combinatorial polymerization system. We believe that the current research paves a straightforward way to synthesize new libraries of polymers via MCRs and might prompt the broader study of MCRs in interdisciplinary fields."
"Incorporation of chemical modifications into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) increases their metabolic stability and improves their tissue distribution. However, how these modifications impact interactions with Argonaute-2 (Ago2), the molecular target of siRNAs, is not known. Herein we present the crystal structure of human Ago2 bound to a metabolically stable siRNA containing extensive backbone modifications. Comparison to the structure of an equivalent unmodified-siRNA complex indicates that the structure of Ago2 is relatively unaffected by chemical modifications in the bound siRNA. In contrast, the modified siRNA appears to be much more plastic and shifts, relative to the unmodified siRNA, to optimize contacts with Ago2. Structure\xe2\x80\x93activity analysis reveals that even major conformational perturbations in the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 half of the siRNA seed region have a relatively modest effect on knockdown potency. These findings provide an explanation for a variety of modification patterns tolerated in siRNAs and a structural basis for advancing therapeutic siRNA design."
"Inspired by self-repair mechanism of PSII in plants, we report a self-healing system which spontaneously repairs molecular catalyst and photosensitizer during photocatalytic H2 evolution. A bipyridine-embedded UiO-type metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework (MOF), namely Ptn_Ir_BUiO, which incorporated H2-evolving catalyst and photosensitizer, was synthesized and subject to photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (HER). Impressively, HER with Pt0.1_Ir_BUiO showed very stable molecular photocatalysis without significant decrease in its activity and colloidal formation for 6.5 days at least; in the homogeneous counterpart, the molecular catalyst became a colloid just after 7.5 h. It was revealed that the arrangement of diimine sites which closely and densely surrounded the H2-evolving catalyst and photosensitizer in the MOF enabled such a highly efficient self-healing."
"Near-infrared (NIR)-to-visible (vis) photon upconversion (UC) is useful for various applications; however, it remains challenging in triplet\xe2\x80\x93triplet annihilation-based UC, mainly due to the energy loss during the S1-to-T1 intersystem crossing (ISC) of molecular sensitizers. In this work, we circumvent this energy loss by employing a sensitizer with direct S0-to-T1 absorption in the NIR region. A mixed solution of an osmium complex having a strong S0\xe2\x80\x93T1 absorption and rubrene emitter upconverts NIR light (\xce\xbb = 938 nm) to visible light (\xce\xbb = 570 nm). Sensitizer-doped emitter nanoparticles are prepared by re-precipitation and dispersed into an oxygen-barrier polymer. The obtained composite film shows a stable NIR-to-vis UC emission based on triplet energy migration (TEM), even in air. A high UC quantum yield of 3.1% is observed for this TEM-UC system, expanding the scope of molecular sensitizers for NIR-to-vis UC."
"Nitrogen fixation is one of the most important issues but a long-standing challenge in chemistry. Here, we propose FeN3-embedded graphene as the catalyst for nitrogen fixation from first-principles calculations. Results show that in view of the chemical coordination, the FeN3 center is highly spin-polarized with a localized magnetic moment substantially to promote N2 adsorption and activate its inert N-N triple bond. The synergy between the graphene and FeN3 equips the system with novel features for the catalytic conversion of the activated N2 into NH3 via a six-proton and six-electron process, following three possible reaction pathways at room temperature. Our findings provide a rational paradigm for catalytic nitrogen fixation that would be conducive to ammonia production."
"Unveiling the ligand binding mode on the crystalline surfaces is important for deciphering the long-standing structural enigma in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Here, the binding and patterning structures of thiolates (SR) on the Au(100) crystalline facet are revealed on the basis of the atomic structure of a highly regular, single crystalline Au92(SR)44 nanocrystal. The six exposed facets of this tetragonal nanocrystal give rise to six pieces of \xe2\x80\x9cnanoSAMs\xe2\x80\x9d. We found that thiolates bind to the planar (100) facets of the nanocrystal via a simple bridge-like mode and are assembled into an overlayer with c(2 \xc3\x97 2) symmetry. The Au\xe2\x80\x93S binding mode and translational symmetry in the kernel and on the surface of the Au92 nanocrystal can be generalized infinitely to construct the bulk two-dimensional SAMs and various tetragonal nanocrystals."
"The coordination of H2 to a metal center via polarization of its \xcf\x83 bond electron density, known as a Kubas complex, is the means by which H2 chemisorbs at Ru4+ sites on the rutile RuO2(110) surface. This distortion of electron density off an interatomic axis is often described as a \xe2\x80\x98banana-bond.\xe2\x80\x99 We show that the Ru\xe2\x80\x93H2 banana-bond can be destabilized and split using visible light. Photodesorption of H2 (or D2) is evident by mass spectrometry and scanning tunneling microscopy. From time-dependent density functional theory, the key optical excitation splitting the Ru\xe2\x80\x93H2 complex involves an interband transition in RuO2 which effectively diminishes its Lewis acidity, thereby weakening the Kubas complex. Such excitations are not expected to affect adsorbates on RuO2 given its metallic properties. Therefore, this common thermal cocatalyst employed in photocatalysis is, itself, photoactive."
A general method for the hydropyridylation of unactivated alkenes is described. The transformation connects metal-mediated hydrogen atom transfer to alkenes and Minisci addition reactions. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with high site-selectivities and allows for the construction of tertiary and quaternary centers from simple alkene starting materials.
"DNA surface ligands can be used as programmable \xe2\x80\x9cbonds\xe2\x80\x9d to control the arrangement of nanoparticles into crystalline superlattices. Here, we study the intrinsic responsiveness of these DNA bonds to changes in local dielectric constant (\xce\xb5r) as a new approach to dynamically modulate superlattice structure. Remarkably, ethanol (EtOH) addition can be used to controllably tune DNA bond length from 16 to 3 nm and to increase bond stability by >40 \xc2\xb0C, while retaining long-range order and crystal habit. Interestingly, we find that these structural changes, which involve the expansion and contraction of crystals by up to 75% in volume, occur in a cooperative fashion once a critical percentage of EtOH is reached. These results provide a facile and robust approach to create stimuli-responsive lattices, to access high volume fractions, and to improve thermal stability."
"The intramolecular cyclization of N-benzylfumaramide [2]rotaxanes is described. The mechanical bond of these substrates activates this transformation to proceed in high yields and in a regio- and diastereoselective manner, giving interlocked 3,4-disubstituted trans-azetidin-2-ones. This activation effect markedly differs from the more common shielding protection of threaded functions by the macrocycle, in this case promoting an unusual and disfavored 4-exo-trig ring closure. Kinetic and synthetic studies allowed us to delineate an advantageous approach toward \xce\xb2-lactams based on a two-step, one-pot protocol: an intramolecular ring closure followed by a thermally induced dethreading step. The advantages of carrying out this cyclization in the confined space of a benzylic amide macrocycle are attributed to its anchimeric assistance."
"We report a novel bifunctional cyanating reagent, Me2(CH2Cl)SiCN, which paves the way to a one-pot sequential synthesis of tertiary alcohols featuring a chloromethyl ketone moiety via enantioselective ketone cyanosilylation. This method contributes to gram-scale enantioselective total synthesis of the aggregation pheromone of the Colorado potato beetle, (S)-CPB."
"The first example of direct and site-selective arylation of indoles at the C6 position has been reported. The key to this high regioselectivity is the appropriate choice of the N\xe2\x80\x93P(O)tBu2 directing group and the use of diaryliodonium triflate salts as the coupling partners in the presence of catalytic CuO. The protocol is distinguished by mild reaction system that avoids ligand and additives, exhibiting wide scope of indole and arene coupling components without compromising its efficiency and scalability, thus representing a significant advancement in the implementation of regioselective direct arylation of indoles."
"Reduction of carbonyls by SmI2 is significantly impacted by the presence of water, but the fundamental step(s) of initial transfer of a formal hydrogen atom from the SmI2\xe2\x80\x93water reagent system to produce an intermediate radical is not fully understood. In this work, we provide evidence consistent with the reduction of carbonyls by SmI2\xe2\x80\x93water proceeding through proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). Combined rate and computational studies show that a model aldehyde and ketone are likely reduced through an asynchronous PCET, whereas reduction of a representative lactone occurs through a concerted PCET. In the latter case, concerted PCET is likely a consequence of significantly endergonic initial electron transfer."
"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a set of proteins that lack a definite secondary structure in solution. IDPs can acquire tertiary structure when bound to their partners; therefore, the recognition process must also involve protein folding. The nature of the transition state (TS), structured or unstructured, determines the binding mechanism. The characterization of the TS has become a major challenge for experimental techniques and molecular simulations approaches since diffusion, recognition, and binding is coupled to folding. In this work we present atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that sample the free energy surface of the coupled folding and binding of the transcription factor c-myb to the cotranscription factor CREB binding protein (CBP). This process has been recently studied and became a model to study IDPs. Despite the plethora of available information, we still do not know how c-myb binds to CBP. We performed a set of atomistic biased MD simulations running a total of 15.6 \xce\xbcs. Our results show that c-myb folds very fast upon binding to CBP with no unique pathway for binding. The process can proceed through both structured or unstructured TS\xe2\x80\x99s with similar probabilities. This finding reconciles previous seemingly different experimental results. We also performed Go-type coarse-grained MD of several structured and unstructured models that indicate that coupled folding and binding follows a native contact mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first atomistic MD simulation that samples the free energy surface of the coupled folding and binding processes of IDPs."
"Photoexcited Nickel(II) tetramesitylporphyrin (NiTMP), like many open-shell metalloporphyrins, relaxes rapidly through multiple electronic states following an initial porphyrin-based excitation, some involving metal centered electronic configuration changes that could be harnessed catalytically before excited state relaxation. While a NiTMP excited state present at 100 ps was previously identified by X-ray transient absorption (XTA) spectroscopy at a synchrotron source as a relaxed (d,d) state, the lowest energy excited state (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2007, 129, 9616 and Chem. Sci., 2010, 1, 642), structural dynamics before thermalization were not resolved due to the \xe2\x88\xbc100 ps duration of the available X-ray probe pulse. Using the femtosecond (fs) X-ray pulses of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), the Ni center electronic configuration from the initial excited state to the relaxed (d,d) state has been obtained via ultrafast Ni K-edge XANES (X-ray absorption near edge structure) on a time scale from hundreds of femtoseconds to 100 ps. This enabled the identification of a short-lived Ni(I) species aided by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) methods. Computed electronic and nuclear structure for critical excited electronic states in the relaxation pathway characterize the dependence of the complex\xe2\x80\x99s geometry on the electron occupation of the 3d orbitals. Calculated XANES transitions for these excited states assign a short-lived transient signal to the spectroscopic signature of the Ni(I) species, resulting from intramolecular charge transfer on a time scale that has eluded previous synchrotron studies. These combined results enable us to examine the excited state structural dynamics of NiTMP prior to thermal relaxation and to capture intermediates of potential photocatalytic significance."
"The reactions of [\xce\xb3-SiW10O36]8\xe2\x80\x93 represent one of the most important synthetic gateways into a vast array of polyoxotungstate chemistry. Herein, we set about exploring the transformation of the lacunary polyoxoanion [\xce\xb22-SiW11O39]8\xe2\x80\x93 into [\xce\xb3-SiW10O36]8\xe2\x80\x93 using high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry, density functional theory, and molecular dynamics. We show that the reaction proceeds through an unexpected {SiW9} precursor capable of undertaking a direct \xce\xb2 \xe2\x86\x92 \xce\xb3 isomerization via a rotational transformation. The remarkably low-energy transition state of this transformation could be identified through theoretical calculations. Moreover, we explore the significant role of the countercations for the first time in such studies. This combination of experimental and the theoretical studies can now be used to understand the complex chemical transformations of oxoanions, leading to the design of reactivity by structural control."
"Based on a metal-templated approach using a rigid and globular structural scaffold in the form of a bis-cyclometalated octahedral iridium complex, an exceptionally active hydrogen-bond-mediated asymmetric catalyst was developed and its mode of action investigated by crystallography, NMR, computation, kinetic experiments, comparison with a rhodium congener, and reactions in the presence of competing H-bond donors and acceptors. Relying exclusively on weak forces, the enantioselective conjugate reduction of nitroalkenes can be executed at catalyst loadings as low as 0.004 mol% (40 ppm), representing turnover numbers of up to 20\xe2\x80\xaf250. A rate acceleration by the catalyst of 2.5 \xc3\x97 105 was determined. The origin of the catalysis is traced to an effective stabilization of developing charges in the transition state by carefully orchestrated hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals interactions between catalyst and substrates. This study demonstrates that the proficiency of asymmetric catalysis merely driven by hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals interactions can rival traditional activation through direct transition metal coordination of the substrate."
"Novel heterogeneous cobalt-based catalysts have been prepared by pyrolysis of cobalt complexes with nitrogen ligands on different inorganic supports. The activity and selectivity of the resulting materials in the hydrogenation of nitriles and carbonyl compounds is strongly influenced by the modification of the support and the nitrogen-containing ligand. The optimal catalyst system ([Co(OAc)2/Phen@\xce\xb1-Al2O3]-800 = Cat. E) allows for efficient reduction of both aromatic and aliphatic nitriles including industrially relevant dinitriles to primary amines under mild conditions. The generality and practicability of this system is further demonstrated in the hydrogenation of diverse aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic ketones as well as aldehydes, which are readily reduced to the corresponding alcohols."
"N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor ion channel is activated by the binding of two pairs of glycine and glutamate along with the application of action potential. Binding and unbinding of ligands changes its conformation that plays a critical role in the open\xe2\x80\x93close activities of NMDA receptor. Conformation states and their dynamics due to ligand binding are extremely difficult to characterize either by conventional ensemble experiments or single-channel electrophysiology method. Here we report the development of a new correlated technical approach, single-molecule patch-clamp FRET anisotropy imaging and demonstrate by probing the dynamics of NMDA receptor ion channel and kinetics of glycine binding with its ligand binding domain. Experimentally determined kinetics of ligand binding with receptor is further verified by computational modeling. Single-channel patch-clamp and four-channel fluorescence measurement are recorded simultaneously to get correlation among electrical on and off states, optically determined conformational open and closed states by FRET, and binding-unbinding states of the glycine ligand by anisotropy measurement at the ligand binding domain of GluN1 subunit. This method has the ability to detect the intermediate states in addition to electrical on and off states. Based on our experimental results, we have proposed that NMDA receptor gating goes through at least one electrically intermediate off state, a desensitized state, when ligands remain bound at the ligand binding domain with the conformation similar to the fully open state."
"The members of the rhodopsin family of proteins are involved in many essential light-dependent processes in biology. Specific photoisomerization of the protein-bound retinylidene PSB at a specified wavelength range of light is at the heart of all of these systems. Nonetheless, it has been difficult to reproduce in an engineered system. We have developed rhodopsin mimics, using intracellular lipid binding protein family members as scaffolds, to study fundamental aspects of protein/chromophore interactions. Herein we describe a system that specifically isomerizes the retinylidene protonated Schiff base both thermally and photochemically. This isomerization has been characterized at atomic resolution by quantitatively interconverting the isomers in the crystal both thermally and photochemically. This event is accompanied by a large pKa change of the imine similar to the pKa changes observed in bacteriorhodopsin and visual opsins during isomerization."
"Hydrogenations constitute fundamental processes in organic chemistry and allow for atom-efficient and clean functional group transformations. In fact, the selective reduction of nitriles, ketones, and aldehydes with molecular hydrogen permits access to a green synthesis of valuable amines and alcohols. Despite more than a century of developments in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, efforts toward the creation of new useful and broadly applicable catalyst systems are ongoing. Recently, Earth-abundant metals have attracted significant interest in this area. In the present study, we describe for the first time specific molecular-defined manganese complexes that allow for the hydrogenation of various polar functional groups. Under optimal conditions, we achieve good functional group tolerance, and industrially important substrates, e.g., for the flavor and fragrance industry, are selectively reduced."
"The capacity to respond to environmental changes is crucial to an organism\xe2\x80\x99s survival. Halorhodospira halophila is a photosynthetic bacterium that swims away from blue light, presumably in an effort to evade photons energetic enough to be genetically harmful. The protein responsible for this response is believed to be photoactive yellow protein (PYP), whose chromophore photoisomerizes from trans to cis in the presence of blue light. We investigated the complete PYP photocycle by acquiring time-resolved small and wide-angle X-ray scattering patterns (SAXS/WAXS) over 10 decades of time spanning from 100 ps to 1 s. Using a sequential model, global analysis of the time-dependent scattering differences recovered four intermediates (pR0/pR1, pR2, pB0, pB1), the first three of which can be assigned to prior time-resolved crystal structures. The 1.8 ms pB0 to pB1 transition produces the PYP signaling state, whose radius of gyration (Rg = 16.6 \xc3\x85) is significantly larger than that for the ground state (Rg = 14.7 \xc3\x85) and is therefore inaccessible to time-resolved protein crystallography. The shape of the signaling state, reconstructed using GASBOR, is highly anisotropic and entails significant elongation of the long axis of the protein. This structural change is consistent with unfolding of the 25 residue N-terminal domain, which exposes the \xce\xb2-scaffold of this sensory protein to a potential binding partner. This mechanistically detailed description of the complete PYP photocycle, made possible by time-resolved crystal and solution studies, provides a framework for understanding signal transduction in proteins and for assessing and validating theoretical/computational approaches in protein biophysics."
"The mechanism of capacity fade of the Li2MnO3\xc2\xb7LiMO2 (M = Li, Ni, Co, Mn) composite positive electrode within a full cell was investigated using a combination of operando neutron powder diffraction and transmission X-ray microscopy methods, enabling the phase, crystallographic, and morphological evolution of the material during electrochemical cycling to be understood. The electrode was shown to initially consist of 73(1) wt % R3\xcc\x85m LiMO2 with the remaining 27(1) wt % C2/m Li2MnO3 likely existing as an intergrowth. Cracking in the Li2MnO3\xc2\xb7LiMO2 electrode particle under operando microscopy observation was revealed to be initiated by the solid-solution reaction of the LiMO2 phase on charge to 4.55 V vs Li+/Li and intensified during further charge to 4.7 V vs Li+/Li during the concurrent two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase, involving the largest lattice change of any phase, and oxygen evolution from the Li2MnO3 phase. Notably, significant healing of the generated cracks in the Li2MnO3\xc2\xb7LiMO2 electrode particle occurred during subsequent lithiation on discharge, with this rehealing being principally associated with the solid-solution reaction of the LiMO2 phase. This work reveals that while it is the reduction of lattice size of electrode phases during charge that results in cracking of the Li2MnO3\xc2\xb7LiMO2 electrode particle, with the extent of cracking correlated to the magnitude of the size change, crack healing is possible in the reverse solid-solution reaction occurring during discharge. Importantly, it is the phase separation during the two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase that prevents the complete healing of the electrode particle, leading to pulverization over extended cycling. This work points to the minimization of behavior leading to phase separation, such as two-phase and oxygen evolution, as a key strategy in preventing capacity fade of the electrode."
"Carbon dioxide accumulation is a major concern for the ecosystems, but its abundance and low cost make it an interesting source for the production of chemical feedstocks and fuels. However, the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the carbon dioxide molecule makes its activation a challenging task. Studying the chemistry used by nature to functionalize carbon dioxide should be helpful for the development of new efficient (bio)catalysts for atmospheric carbon dioxide utilization. In this work, the ability of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans formate dehydrogenase (Dd FDH) to reduce carbon dioxide was kinetically and mechanistically characterized. The Dd FDH is suggested to be purified in an inactive form that has to be activated through a reduction-dependent mechanism. A kinetic model of a hysteretic enzyme is proposed to interpret and predict the progress curves of the Dd FDH-catalyzed reactions (initial lag phase and subsequent faster phase). Once activated, Dd FDH is able to efficiently catalyze, not only the formate oxidation (kcat of 543 s\xe2\x80\x931, Km of 57.1 \xce\xbcM), but also the carbon dioxide reduction (kcat of 46.6 s\xe2\x80\x931, Km of 15.7 \xce\xbcM), in an overall reaction that is thermodynamically and kinetically reversible. Noteworthy, both Dd FDH-catalyzed formate oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction are completely inactivated by cyanide. Current FDH reaction mechanistic proposals are discussed and a different mechanism is here suggested: formate oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction are proposed to proceed through hydride transfer and the sulfo group of the oxidized and reduced molybdenum center, Mo6+\xe2\x95\x90S and Mo4+-SH, are suggested to be the direct hydride acceptor and donor, respectively."
"This paper describes the control of electron exchange between a colloidal PbS quantum dot (QD) and a negatively charged small molecule (9,10-anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid sodium salt, AQ), through tuning of the charge density in the ligand shell of the QD, within an aqueous dispersion. The probability of electron exchange, measured through steady-state and time-resolved optical spectroscopy, is directly related to the permeability of the protective ligand shell, which is a mixed monolayer of negatively charged 6-mercaptohexanoate (MHA) and neutral 6-mercaptohexanol (MHO), to AQ. The composition of the ligand shell is quantitatively characterized by 1H NMR. The dependence of the change in Gibbs free energy, \xce\x94Gobs, for the diffusion of AQ through the charged ligand shell and its subsequent adsorption to the QD surface is well-described with an electrostatic double-layer model for the QD/solvent interface. Fits of the optical data to this model yield an increase in the free energy for transfer of AQ from bulk solution to the surface of the QD (where it exchanges electrons with the QD) of 154 J/mol upon introduction of each additional charged MHA ligand to the ligand shell. This work expands the set of chemical parameters useful for controlling the redox activity of QDs via surface modification and suggests strategies for the use of nanoparticles for molecular and biomolecular recognition within chemically complex environments and for design of chemically stable nanoparticles for aqueous photocatalytic systems."
"Hexafluoroisopropan-2-ol (HFIP) has been found to be an unusually beneficial solvent for undertaking hypervalent iodine-initiated [2+2] cycloaddition of styrenes. For the initiator phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA), voltammetric data demonstrate that the enhanced reactivity in HFIP is due to its greater oxidizing abilities in this fluorinated solvent such that in HFIP the reactivity of PIDA is comparable if not superior to its fluorinated analog phenyliodine(III) bis(trifluoroacetate). These results contrast with the often reported view that the role of the fluoroalcohol is to stabilize a radical cation formed by single electron transfer. Moreover, combined NMR and HRMS results reveal the formation of a strong H-bonded adduct between the solvent and oxidizing reagent which is the physical origin of the observed altered synthetic reactivity."
"The enzyme isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) installs the \xce\xb2-lactam and thiazolidine rings of the penicillin core into the linear tripeptide l-\xce\xb4-aminoadipoyl-l-Cys-d-Val (ACV) on the pathways to a number of important antibacterial drugs. A classic set of enzymological and crystallographic studies by Baldwin and co-workers established that this overall four-electron oxidation occurs by a sequence of two oxidative cyclizations, with the \xce\xb2-lactam ring being installed first and the thiazolidine ring second. Each phase requires cleavage of an aliphatic C\xe2\x80\x93H bond of the substrate: the pro-S-CCys,\xce\xb2\xe2\x80\x93H bond for closure of the \xce\xb2-lactam ring, and the CVal,\xce\xb2\xe2\x80\x93H bond for installation of the thiazolidine ring. IPNS uses a mononuclear non-heme-iron(II) cofactor and dioxygen as cosubstrate to cleave these C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds and direct the ring closures. Despite the intense scrutiny to which the enzyme has been subjected, the identities of the oxidized iron intermediates that cleave the C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds have been addressed only computationally; no experimental insight into their geometric or electronic structures has been reported. In this work, we have employed a combination of transient-state-kinetic and spectroscopic methods, together with the specifically deuterium-labeled substrates, A[d2-C]V and AC[d8-V], to identify both C\xe2\x80\x93H-cleaving intermediates. The results show that they are high-spin Fe(III)-superoxo and high-spin Fe(IV)-oxo complexes, respectively, in agreement with published mechanistic proposals derived computationally from Baldwin\xe2\x80\x99s founding work."
"Recent findings about ultrahigh thermoelectric performance in SnSe single crystals have stimulated related research on this simple binary compound, which is focused mostly on its polycrystalline counterparts, and particularly on electrical property enhancement by effective doping. This work systematically investigated the thermoelectric properties of polycrystalline SnSe doped with three alkali metals (Li, Na, and K). It is found that Na has the best doping efficiency, leading to an increase in hole concentration from 3.2 \xc3\x97 1017 to 4.4 \xc3\x97 1019 cm\xe2\x80\x933 at room temperature, accompanied by a drop in Seebeck coefficient from 480 to 142 \xce\xbcV/K. An equivalent single parabolic band model was found adequate to capture the variation tendency of Seebeck coefficient with doping levels within a wide range. A mixed scattering of carriers by acoustic phonons and grain boundaries is suitable for numerically understanding the temperature-dependence of carrier mobility. A maximum ZT of \xe2\x88\xbc0.8 was achieved in 1% Na- or K-doped SnSe at 800 K. Possible strategies to improve the mobility and ZT of polycrystals were also proposed."
"Heterometallic single-source precursors for the preparation of sodium\xe2\x80\x93rare earth metal fluorides are reported. Fluorinated \xce\xb2-diketonates NaRE(hfac)4 (RE = Y (1), Er (2), and Eu (3); hfac = hexafluoroacetylacetonate) have been obtained on a large scale, in high yield, via one-pot reaction that utilizes commercially available starting reagents. The solid-state structures of the title complexes consist of 1D polymeric chains with alternating [Na] and [RE(hfac)4] units. Compounds 1\xe2\x80\x933 are highly volatile and exhibit a fair stability in open air. Mass spectrometric investigation indicates the presence of heterometallic fragments in the gas phase. The presence of heterometallic species in solutions of coordinating solvents has also been confirmed. Decomposition of heterometallic precursors in argon atmosphere was shown to yield phase-pure sodium\xe2\x80\x93rare earth metal fluorides. Low decomposition temperature effectively allows for a high degree of control over the formation of both kinetic \xce\xb1-phases and thermodynamic \xce\xb2-phases of target NaREF4 (RE = Y, Er, and Eu) materials."
"Nanostructuring and nanosizing have been widely employed to increase the rate capability in a variety of energy storage materials. While nanoprocessing is required for many materials, we show here that both the capacity and rate performance of low-temperature bronze-phase TT- and T-polymorphs of Nb2O5 are inherent properties of the bulk crystal structure. Their unique \xe2\x80\x9croom-and-pillar\xe2\x80\x9d NbO6/NbO7 framework structure provides a stable host for lithium intercalation; bond valence sum mapping exposes the degenerate diffusion pathways in the sites (rooms) surrounding the oxygen pillars of this complex structure. Electrochemical analysis of thick films of micrometer-sized, insulating niobia particles indicates that the capacity of the T-phase, measured over a fixed potential window, is limited only by the Ohmic drop up to at least 60C (12.1 A\xc2\xb7g\xe2\x80\x931), while the higher temperature (Wadsley\xe2\x80\x93Roth, crystallographic shear structure) H-phase shows high intercalation capacity (>200 mA\xc2\xb7h\xc2\xb7g\xe2\x80\x931) but only at moderate rates. High-resolution 6/7Li solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of T-Nb2O5 revealed two distinct spin reservoirs, a small initial rigid population and a majority-component mobile distribution of lithium. Variable-temperature NMR showed lithium dynamics for the majority lithium characterized by very low activation energies of 58(2)\xe2\x80\x9398(1) meV. The fast rate, high density, good gravimetric capacity, excellent capacity retention, and safety features of bulk, insulating Nb2O5 synthesized in a single step at relatively low temperatures suggest that this material not only is structurally and electronically exceptional but merits consideration for a range of further applications. In addition, the realization of high rate performance without nanostructuring in a complex insulating oxide expands the field for battery material exploration beyond conventional strategies and structural motifs."
"The development of fundamentally new approaches for lignin depolymerization is challenged by the complexity of this aromatic biopolymer. While overly simplified model compounds often lack relevance to the chemistry of lignin, the direct use of lignin streams poses significant analytical challenges to methodology development. Ideally, new methods should be tested on model compounds that are complex enough to mirror the structural diversity in lignin but still of sufficiently low molecular weight to enable facile analysis. In this contribution, we present a new class of advanced (\xce\xb2-O-4)-(\xce\xb2-5) dilinkage models that are highly realistic representations of a lignin fragment. Together with selected \xce\xb2-O-4, \xce\xb2-5, and \xce\xb2\xe2\x80\x93\xce\xb2 structures, these compounds provide a detailed understanding of the reactivity of various types of lignin linkages in acid catalysis in conjunction with stabilization of reactive intermediates using ethylene glycol. The use of these new models has allowed for identification of novel reaction pathways and intermediates and led to the characterization of new dimeric products in subsequent lignin depolymerization studies. The excellent correlation between model and lignin experiments highlights the relevance of this new class of model compounds for broader use in catalysis studies. Only by understanding the reactivity of the linkages in lignin at this level of detail can fully optimized lignin depolymerization strategies be developed."
"Precise placement of multiple functional groups in a highly ordered metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework (MOF) platform allows the tailoring of the pore environment, which is required for advanced applications. To realize this, we present a comprehensive study on the linker installation method, in which a stable MOF with coordinatively unsaturated Zr6 clusters was employed and linkers bearing different functional groups were postsynthetically installed. A Zr-MOF with inherent missing linker sites, namely, PCN-700, was initially constructed under kinetic control. Twelve linkers with different substituents were then designed to study their effect on MOF formation kinetics and therefore resulting MOF structures. Guided by the geometrical analysis, linkers with different lengths were installed into a parent PCN-700, giving rise to 11 new MOFs and each bearing up to three different functional groups in predefined positions. Systematic variation of the pore volume and decoration of pore environment were realized by linker installation, which resulted in synergistic effects including an enhancement of H2 adsorption capacities of up to 57%. In addition, a size-selective catalytic system for aerobic alcohol oxidation reaction is built in PCN-700 through linker installation, which shows high activity and tunable size selectivity. Altogether, these results exemplify the capability of the linker installation method in the pore environment engineering of stable MOFs with multiple functional groups, giving an unparalleled level of control."
"Organic chemists are able to synthesize molecules in greater number and chemical complexity than ever before. Yet, a majority of these compounds go untested in biological systems, and those that do are often tested long after the chemist can incorporate the results into synthetic planning. We propose the use of high-dimensional \xe2\x80\x9cmultiplex\xe2\x80\x9d assays, which are capable of measuring thousands of cellular features in one experiment, to annotate rapidly and inexpensively the biological activities of newly synthesized compounds. This readily accessible and inexpensive \xe2\x80\x9creal-time\xe2\x80\x9d profiling method can be used in a prospective manner to facilitate, for example, the efficient construction of performance-diverse small-molecule libraries that are enriched in bioactives. Here, we demonstrate this concept by synthesizing ten triads of constitutionally isomeric compounds via complexity-generating photochemical and thermal rearrangements and measuring compound-induced changes in cellular morphology via an imaging-based \xe2\x80\x9ccell painting\xe2\x80\x9d assay. Our results indicate that real-time biological annotation can inform optimization efforts and library syntheses by illuminating trends relating to biological activity that would be difficult to predict if only chemical structure were considered. We anticipate that probe and drug discovery will benefit from the use of optimization efforts and libraries that implement this approach."
"Modern development of chemical manufacturing requires a substantial reduction in energy consumption and catalyst cost. Sunlight-driven chemical transformation by metal oxides holds great promise for this goal; however, it remains a grand challenge to efficiently couple solar energy into many catalytic reactions. Here we report that defect engineering on oxide catalyst can serve as a versatile approach to bridge light harvesting with surface reactions by ensuring species chemisorption. The chemisorption not only spatially enables the transfer of photoexcited electrons to reaction species, but also alters the form of active species to lower the photon energy requirement for reactions. In a proof of concept, oxygen molecules are activated into superoxide radicals on defect-rich tungsten oxide through visible-near-infrared illumination to trigger organic aerobic couplings of amines to corresponding imines. The excellent efficiency and durability for such a highly important process in chemical transformation can otherwise be virtually impossible to attain by counterpart materials."
"A method to assemble light-responsive or pH-responsive microcapsules loaded with different loads (tetramethylrhodamine-modified dextran, TMR-D; microperoxidase-11, MP-11; CdSe/ZnS quantum dots; or doxorubicin-modified dextran, DOX-D) is described. The method is based on the layer-by-layer deposition of sequence-specific nucleic acids on poly(allylamine hydrochloride)-functionalized CaCO3 core microparticles, loaded with the different loads, that after the dissolution of the core particles with EDTA yields the stimuli-responsive microcapsules that include the respective loads. The light-responsive microcapsules are composed of photocleavable o-nitrobenzyl-phosphate-modified DNA shells, and the pH-responsive microcapsules are made of a cytosine-rich layer cross-linked by nucleic acid bridges. Irradiating the o-nitrobenzyl phosphate-functionalized microcapsules, \xce\xbb = 365 nm, or subjecting the pH-responsive microcapsules to pH = 5.0, results in the cleavage of the microcapsule shells and the release of the loads. Preliminary studies address the cytotoxicity of the DOX-D-loaded microcapsules toward MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and normal MCF-10A breast epithelial cells. Selective cytotoxicity of the DOX-D-loaded microcapsules toward cancer cells is demonstrated."
"The electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen is a simple and attractive approach to store renewable energies in the form of chemical fuels. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a complex four-electron process that constitutes the most energy-inefficient step in water electrolysis. Here we describe a novel electrochemical method for the deposition of a family of thin-film transition metal (oxy)hydroxides as OER catalysts. The thin films have nanodomains of crystallinity with lattice spacing similar to those of double-layered hydroxides. The loadings of these thin-film catalysts were accurately determined with a resolution of below 1 \xce\xbcg cm\xe2\x80\x932 using an electrochemical quartz microcrystal balance. The loading\xe2\x80\x93activity relations for various catalysts were established using voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. The thin-film catalysts have up to four types of loading\xe2\x80\x93activity dependence due to film nucleation and growth as well as the resistance of the films. A zone of intrinsic activity has been identified for all of the catalysts where the mass-averaged activity remains constant while the loading is increased. According to their intrinsic activities, the metal oxides can be classified into three categories: NiOx, MnOx, and FeOx belong to category I, which is the least active; CoOx and CoNiOx belong to category II, which has medium activity; and FeNiOx, CoFeOx, and CoFeNiOx belong to category III, which is the most active. The high turnover frequencies of CoFeOx and CoFeNiOx at low overpotentials and the simple deposition method allow the fabrication of high-performance anode electrodes coated with these catalysts. In 1 M KOH and with the most active electrode, overpotentials as low as 240 and 270 mV are required to reach 10 and 100 mA cm\xe2\x80\x932, respectively."
"Ice crystals in the atmosphere nucleate from supercooled liquid water and grow by vapor uptake. The structure of the ice polymorph grown has strong impact on the morphology and light scattering of the ice crystals, modulates the amount of water vapor in ice clouds, and can impact the molecular uptake and reactivity of atmospheric aerosols. Experiments and molecular simulations indicate that ice nucleated and grown from deeply supercooled liquid water is metastable stacking disordered ice. The ice polymorph grown from vapor has not yet been determined. Here we use large-scale molecular simulations to determine the structure of ice that grows as a result of uptake of water vapor in the temperature range relevant to cirrus and mixed-phase clouds, elucidate the molecular mechanism of the formation of ice at the vapor interface, and compute the free energy difference between cubic and hexagonal ice interfaces with vapor. We find that vapor deposition results in growth of stacking disordered ice only under conditions of extreme supersaturation, for which a nonequilibrium liquid layer completely wets the surface of ice. Such extreme conditions have been used to produce stacking disordered frost ice in experiments and may be plausible in the summer polar mesosphere. Growth of ice from vapor at moderate supersaturations in the temperature range relevant to cirrus and mixed-phase clouds, from 200 to 260 K, produces exclusively the stable hexagonal ice polymorph. Cubic ice is disfavored with respect to hexagonal ice not only by a small penalty in the bulk free energy (3.6 \xc2\xb1 1.5 J mol\xe2\x80\x931 at 260 K) but also by a large free energy penalty at the ice\xe2\x80\x93vapor interface (89.7 \xc2\xb1 12.8 J mol\xe2\x80\x931 at 260 K). The latter originates in higher vibrational entropy of the hexagonal-terminated ice\xe2\x80\x93vapor interface. We predict that the free energy penalty against the cubic ice interface should decrease strongly with temperature, resulting in some degree of stacking disorder in ice grown from vapor in the tropical tropopause layer, and in polar stratospheric and noctilucent clouds. Our findings support and explain the evolution of the morphology of ice crystals from hexagonal to trigonal symmetry with decreasing temperature, as reported by experiments and in situ measurements in clouds. We conclude that selective growth of the elusive cubic ice polymorph by manipulation of the interfacial properties can likely be achieved at the ice\xe2\x80\x93liquid interface but not at the ice\xe2\x80\x93vapor interface."
"A new strategy for the catalytic synthesis of substituted 1H-indenes via metalloradical activation of o-cinnamyl N-tosyl hydrazones is presented, taking advantage of the intrinsic reactivity of a CoIII carbene radical intermediate. The reaction uses readily available starting materials and is operationally simple, thus representing a practical method for the construction of functionalized 1H-indene derivatives. The cheap and easy to prepare low spin cobalt(II) complex [CoII(MeTAA)] (MeTAA = tetramethyltetraaza[14]annulene) proved to be the most active catalyst among those investigated, which demonstrates catalytic carbene radical reactivity for a nonporphyrin cobalt(II) complex, and for the first time catalytic activity of [CoII(MeTAA)] in general. The methodology has been successfully applied to a broad range of substrates, producing 1H-indenes in good to excellent yields. The metallo-radical catalyzed indene synthesis in this paper represents a unique example of a net (formal) intramolecular carbene insertion reaction into a vinylic C(sp2)\xe2\x80\x93H bond, made possible by a controlled radical ring-closure process of the carbene radical intermediate involved. The mechanism was investigated computationally, and the results were confirmed by a series of supporting experimental reactions. Density functional theory calculations reveal a stepwise process involving activation of the diazo compound leading to formation of a CoIII-carbene radical, followed by radical ring-closure to produce an indanyl/benzyl radical intermediate. Subsequent indene product elimination involving a 1,2-hydrogen transfer step regenerates the catalyst. Trapping experiments using 2,2,6,6-tetra-methylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) radical or dibenzoylperoxide (DBPO) confirm the involvement of cobalt(III) carbene radical intermediates. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic spin-trapping experiments using phenyl N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) reveal the radical nature of the reaction."
"This work proves the existence and chemical addressability of defined edge groups of a 2D polymer. Pseudohexagonally prismatic single crystals consisting of layered stacks of a 2D polymer are used. They should expose anthracene-based edge groups at the six (100) but not at the two pseudohexagonal (001) and (001\xcc\x85) faces. The crystals are reacted with the isotopically enriched dienophiles maleic anhydride and a C18-alkyl chain-modified maleimide. In both cases the corresponding Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder adducts between these reagents and the edge groups are formed as confirmed by solid state NMR spectroscopy. The same applies to a maleimide derivative carrying a BODIPY dye which was chosen for its fluorescence to be out of the range of the self-fluorescence of the 2D polymer crystals stemming from contained template molecules. If the crystals are excited at \xce\xbb = 633 nm, their (100) faces and thus their rims fluoresce brightly, while the pseudohexagonal faces remain silent. This is visible when the crystals lie on a pseudohexagonal face. Lambda-mode laser scanning microscopy confirms this fluorescence to originate from the BODIPY dye. Micromechanical exfoliation of the dye-modified crystals results in thinner sheet packages which still exhibit BODIPY fluorescence right at the rim of these packages. This work establishes the chemical nature of the edge groups of a 2D polymer and is also the first implementation of an edge group modification similar to end group modifications of linear polymers."
A multidisciplinary approach allows researchers to study how an enzyme binds and cleaves polysaccharide chains on the surface of its bacterial host.
"Surface science has had a major influence on the understanding of processes at surfaces relevant to catalysis. Real catalysts are complex materials, and in order to approach an understanding at the atomic level, it is necessary in a first step to drastically reduce complexity and then systematically increase it again in order to capture the various structural and electronic factors important for the function of the real catalytic material. The use of thin oxide films as templates to mimic three-dimensional supports as such or for metal particles as well as to model charge barriers turns out to be appropriate to approach an understanding of metal\xe2\x80\x93support interactions. Thin oxide films also exhibit properties in their own right that turn out to be relevant in catalysis. Thin oxide film formation may also be used to create unique two-dimensional materials. The present perspective introduces the subject using case studies and indicates possible routes to further apply this approach successfully."
"A new strategy for catalytic enantioselective C-acylation to generate \xce\xb1-quaternary-substituted lactams is reported. Ni-catalyzed three-component coupling of lactam enolates, benzonitriles, and aryl halides produces \xce\xb2-imino lactams that then afford \xce\xb2-keto lactams by acid hydrolysis. Use of a readily available Mandyphos-type ligand and addition of LiBr enable the construction of quaternary stereocenters on \xce\xb1-substituted lactams to form \xce\xb2-keto lactams in up to 94% ee."
"Photoresponsive DNA modified with azobenzene is an attractive design molecule for efficient photoregulation of DNA hybridization, which may be used for controlling DNA functions. Although the essential step of photocontrolling DNA is the initial isomerization of the azobenzene, the dissociation/association kinetics remain unknown. Here, the time-resolved diffusion method was used to trace the dissociation/association processes of photoresponsive DNA. Although the isomerization of azobenzene occurs in picoseconds, the dissociation of the double-stranded DNA to single-stranded DNA triggered by the trans to cis isomerization takes place \xe2\x88\xbc107 times slower, with a time constant of 670 \xce\xbcs at 200 \xce\xbcM. From the concentration dependence, the dissociation and association rates were determined. Furthermore, the reaction rate from the single- to double-stranded DNA after the cis to trans isomerization was measured to be 3.6 ms at 200 \xce\xbcM. The difference in the melting temperatures of DNA between tethered trans- and cis-azobenzene is explained by the different rate of dissociation of the double-stranded form."
"The enzyme MTH1 cleanses the cellular nucleotide pool of oxidatively damaged 8-oxo-dGTP, preventing mutagenesis by this nucleotide. The enzyme is considered a promising therapeutic target; however, methods to measure its activity are indirect and laborious and have low sensitivity. Here we describe a novel ATP-linked chimeric nucleotide (ARGO) that enables luminescence signaling of the enzymatic reaction, greatly simplifying the measurement of MTH1 activity. We show that the reporting system can be used to identify inhibitors of MTH1, and we use it to quantify enzyme activity in eight cell lines and in colorectal tumor tissue. The ARGO reporter is likely to have considerable utility in the study of the biology of MTH1 and potentially in analyzing patient samples during clinical testing."
Using an electrostatic-based super inkjet printer we report the high-resolution deposition of polyelectrolyte macroinitiators and subsequent polymer brush growth using SI-ARGET-ATRP. We go on to demonstrate for the first time a submicron patterning phenomenon through the addition of either a like charged polyelectrolyte homopolymer or through careful control of ionic strength. As a result patterning of polymer brushes down to ca. 300 nm is reported. We present a possible mechanistic model and consider how this may be applied to other polyelectrolyte-based systems as a general method for submicron patterning.
"Mussel foot proteins (Mfps) exhibit remarkably adaptive adhesion and bridging between polar surfaces in aqueous solution despite the strong hydration barriers at the solid\xe2\x80\x93liquid interface. Recently, catechols and amines\xe2\x80\x94two functionalities that account for >50 mol % of the amino acid side chains in surface-priming Mfps\xe2\x80\x94were shown to cooperatively displace the interfacial hydration and mediate robust adhesion between mineral surfaces. Here we demonstrate that (1) synergy between catecholic and guanidinium side chains similarly promotes adhesion, (2) increasing the ratio of cationic amines to catechols in a molecule reduces adhesion, and (3) the catechol\xe2\x80\x93cation synergy is greatest when both functionalities are present within the same molecule."
"The first interrupted asymmetric hydroaminomethylation reaction was developed. The challenging trans-1,2-disubstituted olefins were employed as substrates, and a series of valuable chiral pyrrolidinones and pyrrolidines were obtained in high yields with high regioselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities. Several synthetic transformations were conducted, demonstrating the high synthetic utility of our method. A creative route for the synthesis of vernakalant and Enablex was also developed."
"A tandem demethylation-aryl borylation strategy was developed to synthesize OBO-doped tetrabenzo[a,f,j,o]perylenes (namely \xe2\x80\x9cbistetracenes\xe2\x80\x9d) and tetrabenzo[bc,ef,kl,no]coronenes (namely \xe2\x80\x9cperitetracenes\xe2\x80\x9d). The OBO-doped bistetracene analogues exhibited excellent stability and strong fluorescence, in contrast to the unstable all-carbon bistetracene. Single-crystal X-ray analysis for OBO-doped bistetracene revealed a twisted double [5]helicene structure, indicating that this synthesis is applicable to new heterohelicenes. Importantly, cyclodehydrogenation of the bistetracene analogues successfully produced the unprecedented heteroatom-doped peritetracenes, which opened up a new avenue to periacene-type nanographenes with stable zigzag edges."
"An organogelator based on the Disperse Red nonlinear optical chromophore was synthesized according to a simple and efficient three-step procedure. The supramolecular gel organization leads to xerogels which display a spontaneous second harmonic generation (SHG) response without any need for preprocessing, and this SHG activity appears to be stable over several months. These findings, based on an intrinsic structural approach, are supported by favorable intermolecular supramolecular interactions, which promote a locally non-centrosymmetric NLO-active organization. This is in sharp contrast with most materials designed for SHG purposes, which generally require the use of expensive or heavy-to-handle external techniques for managing the dipoles\xe2\x80\x99 alignment."
We have elucidated excimer-mediated intramolecular electron transfer in cofacially stacked PBIs tethered by two phenylene-butadiynylene loops. The electron transfer between energetically equivalent PBIs is revealed by the simultaneous observation of the PBI radical anion and cation bands in the transient absorption spectra. The fluorescence decay time of the excimer states is in good agreement with the rise time of PBI radical bands in transient absorption spectra suggesting that the electron transfer dynamics proceed via the excimer state. We can conclude that the excimer state effectuates the efficient charge transfer in the cofacially stacked PBI dimer.
"The encapsulation of actinide ions in intermetalloid clusters has long been proposed but was never realized synthetically. We report the isolation and experimental, as well as quantum chemical, characterization of the uranium-centered clusters [U@Bi12]3\xe2\x80\x93, [U@Tl2Bi11]3\xe2\x80\x93, [U@Pb7Bi7]3\xe2\x80\x93, and [U@Pb4Bi9]3\xe2\x80\x93, upon reaction of (EE\xe2\x80\xb2Bi2)2\xe2\x80\x93 (E = Ga, Tl, E\xe2\x80\xb2 = Bi; E = E\xe2\x80\xb2 = Pb) and [U(C5Me4H)3] or [U(C5Me4H)3Cl] in 1,2-diaminoethane. For [U@Bi12]3\xe2\x80\x93, magnetic susceptibility measurements rationalize an unprecedented antiferromagnetic coupling between a magnetic U4+ site and a unique radical Bi127\xe2\x80\x93 shell."
"The G-quadruplexes form highly stable nucleic acid structures, which are implicated in various biological processes in both DNA and RNA. Although DNA G-quadruplexes have been studied in great detail, biological roles of RNA G-quadruplexes have received less attention. Here, a screening of a chemical library permitted identification of a small-molecule tool that binds selectively to RNA G-quadruplex structures. The polyaromatic molecule, RGB-1, stabilizes RNA G-quadruplex, but not DNA versions or other RNA structures. RGB-1 intensified the G-quadruplex-mediated inhibition of RNA translation in mammalian cells, decreased expression of the NRAS proto-oncogene in breast cancer cells, and permitted identification of a novel sequence that forms G-quadruplex in NRAS mRNA. RGB-1 may serve as a unique tool for understanding cellular roles of RNA G-quadruplex structures."
"The cinchona alkaloid-derived urea-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of aromatic thiols to cycloalkenones was studied using density functional theory (DFT). Deprotonation of the thiol gives a protonated amine that activates the electrophile by Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid catalysis, while the urea group binds the nucleophilic thiolate by hydrogen bonding. These results demonstrate the generality of the Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid\xe2\x88\x92hydrogen bonding transition state (TS) model for cinchona alkaloid catalysis that we recently showed to be favored over Wynberg\xe2\x80\x99s widely accepted ion pair\xe2\x88\x92hydrogen bonding model and represent the first detailed mechanistic study of a cinchona urea-catalyzed reaction. The conformation of the catalyst methoxy group has a strong effect on the TS, an effect overlooked in previous mechanistic studies of reactions catalyzed by cinchona alkaloids."
"The term cononsolvency has been used to describe a situation in which a polymer is less soluble (and so is more likely to collapse and aggregate) in a mixture of two cosolvents than it is in either one of the pure solvents. Thus, cononsolvency is closely related to the suppression of protein denaturation by stabilizing osmolytes. Here, we show that cononsolvency behavior can also influence the aggregation of tertiary butyl alcohol in mixtures of water and methanol, as demonstrated using both Raman multivariate curve resolution spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results imply that cononsolvency results from the cosolvent-mediated enhancement of the attractive (solvophobic) mean force between nonpolar groups, driven by preferential solvation of the aggregates, in keeping with Wyman\xe2\x80\x93Tanford theory."
"Optogenetics provides powerful means for precise control of neuronal activity; however, the requirement of transgenesis and the incapability to extend the neuron excitation window into the deep-tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) region partially limit its application. We herein report a potential alternative approach to optogenetics using semiconducting polymer nanobioconjugates (SPNsbc) as the photothermal nanomodulator to control the thermosensitive ion channels in neurons. SPNsbc are designed to efficiently absorb the NIR light at 808 nm and have a photothermal conversion efficiency higher than that of gold nanorods. By virtue of the fast heating capability in conjunction with the precise targeting to the thermosensitive ion channel, SPNsbc can specifically and rapidly activate the intracellular Ca2+ influx of neuronal cells in a reversible and safe manner. Our study provides an organic nanoparticle based strategy that eliminates the need for genetic transfection to remotely regulate cellular machinery."
"Two catalysts, an amine HCl salt and a bisthiourea, work in concert to enable the generation of oxocarbenium ions under mild conditions. The amine catalyst generates an iminium ion of sufficient electrophilicity to enable 1,2-attack by an alcohol. Catalyst turnover is achieved by amine elimination with concomitant formation of an oxocarbenium intermediate. The bisthiourea catalyst accelerates all of the steps of the reaction and controls the stereoselectivity via anion binding/ion pair formation. This new concept was applied to direct catalytic enantioselective oxa-Pictet\xe2\x80\x93Spengler reactions of tryptophol with aldehydes."
"The adsorption and mobility of oxygen adspecies on platinum (Pt) surface are crucial for the oxidation of surface-absorbed carbon monoxide (CO), which causes the deactivation of Pt catalyst in fuel cells. By employing nanoelectrode and ultramicroelectrode techniques, we have observed the surface mobility of oxygen adspecies produced by the dissociative adsorption of H2O and the surface reaction between the oxygen adspecies and the preadsorbed CO on the Pt surface. The desorption charge of oxygen adspecies on a Pt nanoelectrode has been found to be in proportion to the reciprocal of the square root of scan rate. Using this information, the apparent surface diffusion coefficient of oxygen adspecies has been determined to be (5.61 \xc2\xb1 0.84) \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x9310 cm2/s at 25 \xc2\xb0C. During the surface oxidation of CO, two current peaks are observed, which are attributed to CO oxidation at the Pt/electrolyte interface and the surface mobility of the oxygen adspecies on the adjacent Pt surface, respectively. These results demonstrate that the surface mobility of oxygen adspecies plays an important role in the antipoisoning and reactivation of Pt catalyst."
"The search for new and efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) materials has been an active research because of their technological importance in laser applications. Although a large number of frequency-doubling oxides, phosphates, borates, and fluoride-containing borates were found, no transition-metal silicate with useful NLO properties has been reported. We have now synthesized and grown crystals of two new titanosilicates, Li2K4[(TiO)Si4O12] and Li2Rb4[(TiO)Si4O12], by using a flux and supercritical hydrothermal method. Their unique 3D framework structures contain highly compressed TiO5 square pyramids which are arranged one over the other to form infinite \xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Ti\xe2\x80\x93O\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Ti\xe2\x80\x93O straight chains with alternating short and long Ti\xe2\x80\x93O distances. These two materials meet the requirements for efficient second harmonic generation including lack of center of inversion symmetry, large susceptibility, phase matching, transmitting at wavelengths of interest, resistant to laser damage, and thermally stable. These attributes make them very attractive for frequency-doubling materials."
"We report the discovery of a less symmetric crystalline phase of Mn12 acetate, a triclinic phase, resulting from recrystallizing the original tetragonal phase reported by Lis in acetonitrile and toluene. This new phase exhibits the same structure of Mn12 acetate clusters and the same positions of tunneling resonances on the magnetic field as the conventional tetragonal phase. However, the width of the zero-field resonance is at least 1 order of magnitude smaller\xe2\x80\x94can be as low as 50 Oe\xe2\x80\x94indicating very small inhomogeneous broadening due to dipolar and nuclear fields."
"Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a powerful method to elucidate molecular structure through the measurement of distances between conformationally well-defined spin labels. Here we report a sequence-flexible approach to the synthesis of double spin-labeled DNA duplexes, where 2\xe2\x80\xb2-alkynylnucleosides are incorporated at terminal and internal positions on complementary strands. Post-DNA synthesis copper-catalyzed azide\xe2\x80\x93alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions with a variety of spin labels enable the use of double electron\xe2\x80\x93electron resonance experiments to measure a number of distances on the duplex, affording a high level of detailed structural information."
"Cupredoxins are electron-transfer proteins that have active sites containing a mononuclear Cu center with an unusual trigonal monopyramidal structure (Type 1 Cu). A single Cu\xe2\x80\x93Scys bond is present within the trigonal plane that is responsible for its unique physical properties. We demonstrate that a cysteine-containing variant of streptavidin (Sav) can serve as a protein host to model the structure and properties of Type 1 Cu sites. A series of artificial Cu proteins are described that rely on Sav and a series of biotinylated synthetic Cu complexes. Optical and EPR measurements highlight the presence of a Cu\xe2\x80\x93Scys bond, and XRD analysis provides structural evidence. We further provide evidence that changes in the linker between the biotin and Cu complex within the synthetic constructs allows for small changes in the placement of Cu centers within Sav that have dramatic effects on the structural and physical properties of the resulting artificial metalloproteins. These findings highlight the utility of the biotin-Sav technology as an approach for simulating active sites of metalloproteins."
"A highly efficient ruthenium pincer-catalyzed Guerbet-type process for the production of biofuel from ethanol has been developed. It produces the highest conversion of ethanol (73.4%, 0.02 mol% catalyst) for a Guerbet-type reaction, including significant amounts of C4 (35.8% yield), C6 (28.2% yield), and C8 (9.4% yield) alcohols. Catalyst loadings as low as 0.001 mol% can be used, leading to a record turnover number of 18\xe2\x80\xaf209. Mechanistic studies reveal the likely active ruthenium species and the main deactivation process."
"Carboranes are boron-rich molecules that can be functionalized through metal-catalyzed cross-coupling. Here, for the first time, we report the use of bromo-carboranes in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling for efficient B\xe2\x80\x93N, B\xe2\x80\x93O, and unprecedented B\xe2\x80\x93CN bond formation. In many cases bromo-carboranes outperform the traditionally utilized iodo-carborane species. This marked difference in reactivity is leveraged to circumvent multistep functionalization by directly coupling small nucleophiles (-OH, -NH2, and -CN) and multiple functional groups onto the boron-rich clusters."
"We present the design, synthesis, and application of a new family of fluorescent voltage indicators based on isomerically pure tetramethylrhodamines. These new Rhodamine Voltage Reporters, or RhoVRs, use photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) as a trigger for voltage sensing, display excitation and emission profiles in the green to orange region of the visible spectrum, demonstrate high sensitivity to membrane potential changes (up to 47% \xce\x94F/F per 100 mV), and employ a tertiary amide derived from sarcosine, which aids in membrane localization and simultaneously simplifies the synthetic route to the voltage sensors. The most sensitive of the RhoVR dyes, RhoVR 1, features a methoxy-substituted diethylaniline donor and phenylenevinylene molecular wire at the 5\xe2\x80\xb2-position of the rhodamine aryl ring, exhibits the highest voltage sensitivity to date for red-shifted PeT-based voltage sensors, and is compatible with simultaneous imaging alongside green fluorescent protein-based indicators. The discoveries that sarcosine-based tertiary amides in the context of molecular-wire voltage indicators prevent dye internalization and 5\xe2\x80\xb2-substituted voltage indicators exhibit improved voltage sensitivity should be broadly applicable to other types of PeT-based voltage-sensitive fluorophores."
"With the aim of developing new highly porous, heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysts for multicomponent reactions, a new mesoporous metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework, InPF-110 ([In3O(btb)2(HCOO)(L)], (H3btb = 1,3,5-tris(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene acid, L = methanol, water, or ethanol), has been prepared with indium as the metal center. It exhibits a Langmuir surface area of 1470 m2 g\xe2\x80\x931, and its structure consists of hexagonal pores with a 2.8 nm aperture, which allows the diffusion of multiple substrates. This material presents a large density of active metal sites resulting in outstanding catalytic activity in the formation of substituted \xce\xb1-aminonitriles through the one-pot Strecker reaction of ketones. In this respect, InPF-110 stands out compared to other catalysts for this reaction due to the small catalyst loadings required, and without the need for heat or solvents. Furthermore, X-ray single crystal diffraction studies clearly show the framework\xe2\x80\x93substrate interaction through coordination to the accessible indium sites."
"In this report, we introduce synthetic anion transporters that operate with chalcogen bonds. Electron-deficient dithieno[3,2-b;2\xe2\x80\xb2,3\xe2\x80\xb2-d]thiophenes (DTTs) are identified as ideal to bind anions in the focal point of the \xcf\x83 holes on the cofacial endocyclic sulfur atoms. Anion binding in solution and anion transport across lipid bilayers are found to increase with the depth of the \xcf\x83 holes of the DTT anionophores. These results introduce DTTs and related architectures as a privileged motif to engineer chalcogen bonds into functional systems, complementary in scope to classics such as 2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-bipyrroles or 2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-bipyridines that operate with hydrogen bonds and lone pairs, respectively."
"Negatively charged nucleic acids are often complexed with polycationic transfection agents before delivery. Herein, we demonstrate that a noncationic, biocompatible polymer, polyethylene glycol, can be used as a transfection vector by forming a brush polymer-DNA conjugate. The brush architecture provides embedded DNA strands with enhanced nuclease stability and improved cell uptake. Because of the biologically benign nature of the polymer component, no cytotoxicity was observed. This approach has the potential to address several long-lasting challenges in oligonucleotide therapeutics."
"LiCs2PO4, a new deep-ultraviolet (UV) transparent material, was synthesized by the flux method. The material contains unusual edge-sharing LiO4-PO4 tetrahedra. It exhibits a very short absorption edge of \xce\xbb = 174 nm and generates the largest powder second harmonic generation (SHG) response for deep-UV phosphates that do not contain additional anionic groups, i.e., 2.6 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP). First-principles electronic structure analyses confirm the experimental results and suggest that the strong SHG response may originate from the aligned nonbonding O-2p orbitals. The discovery and characterization of LiCs2PO4 provide a new insight into the structure\xe2\x80\x93property relationships of phosphate-based nonlinear optical materials with large SHG responses and short absorption edges."
"Alkynyl-\xce\xbb3-iodanes have been established as alkynyl cation equivalents for the alkynylation of carbon- and heteroatom-based nucleophiles. Herein, we report an unprecedented reaction mode of this compound class, which features a Pd(II)-assisted 1,2-I(III) shift of an alkynylbenziodoxole. A Pd(II) catalyst mediates this shift and the subsequent interception of the transient vinylidene species with carboxylic acid (1,1-hydrocarboxylation). The product of this stereoselective rearrangement\xe2\x80\x93addition reaction, \xce\xb2-oxyalkenylbenziodoxole, represents a novel and useful building block for further synthetic transformations."
"Understanding interactions of bacterial surface polysaccharides with receptor protein scaffolds is important for the development of antibiotic therapies. The corresponding protein recognition domains frequently form low-affinity complexes with polysaccharides that are difficult to address with experimental techniques due to the conformational flexibility of the polysaccharide. In this work, we studied the tailspike protein (TSP) of the bacteriophage Sf6. Sf6TSP binds and hydrolyzes the high-rhamnose, serotype Y O-antigen polysaccharide of the Gram-negative bacterium Shigella flexneri (S.\xc2\xa0flexneri) as a first step of bacteriophage infection. Spectroscopic analyses and enzymatic cleavage assays confirmed that Sf6TSP binds long stretches of this polysaccharide. Crystal structure analysis and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy using an enhanced method to interpret the data permitted the detailed description of affinity contributions and flexibility in an Sf6TSP-octasaccharide complex. Dodecasaccharide fragments corresponding to three repeating units of the O-antigen in complex with Sf6TSP were studied computationally by molecular dynamics simulations. They showed that distortion away from the low-energy solution conformation found in the octasaccharide complex is necessary for ligand binding. This is in agreement with a weak-affinity functional polysaccharide\xe2\x80\x93protein contact that facilitates correct placement and thus hydrolysis of the polysaccharide close to the catalytic residues. Our simulations stress that the flexibility of glycan epitopes together with a small number of specific protein contacts provide the driving force for Sf6TSP-polysaccharide complex formation in an overall weak-affinity interaction system."
"The key requirement for a portable store of natural gas is to maximize the amount of gas within the smallest possible space. The packing of methane (CH4) in a given storage medium at the highest possible density is, therefore, a highly desirable but challenging target. We report a microporous hydroxyl-decorated material, MFM-300(In) (MFM = Manchester Framework Material, replacing the NOTT designation), which displays a high volumetric uptake of 202 v/v at 298 K and 35 bar for CH4 and 488 v/v at 77 K and 20 bar for H2. Direct observation and quantification of the location, binding, and rotational modes of adsorbed CH4 and H2 molecules within this host have been achieved, using neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering experiments, coupled with density functional theory (DFT) modeling. These complementary techniques reveal a very efficient packing of H2 and CH4 molecules within MFM-300(In), reminiscent of the condensed gas in pure component crystalline solids. We also report here, for the first time, the experimental observation of a direct binding interaction between adsorbed CH4 molecules and the hydroxyl groups within the pore of a material. This is different from the arrangement found in CH4/water clathrates, the CH4 store of nature."
"Water splitting represents a promising technology for renewable energy conversion and storage, but it is greatly hindered by the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, using Au-nanoparticle-decorated Ni(OH)2 nanosheets [Ni(OH)2\xe2\x80\x93Au] as catalysts, we demonstrate that the photon-induced surface plasmon resonance (SPR) excitation on Au nanoparticles could significantly activate the OER catalysis, specifically achieving a more than 4-fold enhanced activity and meanwhile affording a markedly decreased overpotential of 270 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm\xe2\x80\x932 and a small Tafel slope of 35 mV dec\xe2\x80\x931 (no iR-correction), which is much better than those of the benchmark IrO2 and RuO2, as well as most Ni-based OER catalysts reported to date. The synergy of the enhanced generation of NiIII/IV active species and the improved charge transfer, both induced by hot-electron excitation on Au nanoparticles, is proposed to account for such a markedly increased activity. The SPR-enhanced OER catalysis could also be observed over cobalt oxide (CoO)\xe2\x80\x93Au and iron oxy-hydroxide (FeOOH)\xe2\x80\x93Au catalysts, suggesting the generality of this strategy. These findings highlight the possibility of activating OER catalysis by plasmonic excitation and could open new avenues toward the design of more-energy-efficient catalytic water oxidation systems with the assistance of light energy."
"Since the discovery of graphene, there is an increasing amount of research devoted to graphene materials, namely, graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). The \xe2\x80\x9ctop-down\xe2\x80\x9d production of narrow (<10 nm wide), unoxidized, and easily processable GNRs with atomically precise edges is challenging, and therefore, new methods need to be developed. We have designed a \xe2\x80\x9cbottom-up\xe2\x80\x9d approach for the synthesis of very narrow (ca. 0.5 nm) and soluble GNRs using a nonoxidative alkyne benzannulation strategy promoted by Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid. Suzuki polymerization was used to produce the GNR precursor, a poly(2,6-dialkynyl-p-phenylene) (PDAPP), with a weight-average molecular weight of 37.6 kg mol\xe2\x80\x931. Cyclization of the ethynylaryl side chains on PDAPP was efficiently achieved using Br\xc3\xb8nsted acids to ultimately produce the GNRs. Infrared and Raman spectroscopic characterization of the GNRs matches very well with calculated results. The formation of the GNRs was also supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)."
"pH\xe2\x80\x93rate profiles for aqueous\xe2\x80\x93organic protodeboronation of 18 boronic acids, many widely viewed as unstable, have been studied by NMR and DFT. Rates were pH-dependent, and varied substantially between the boronic acids, with rate maxima that varied over 6 orders of magnitude. A mechanistic model containing five general pathways (k1\xe2\x80\x93k5) has been developed, and together with input of [B]tot, KW, Ka, and KaH, the protodeboronation kinetics can be correlated as a function of pH (1\xe2\x80\x9313) for all 18 species. Cyclopropyl and vinyl boronic acids undergo very slow protodeboronation, as do 3- and 4-pyridyl boronic acids (t0.5 > 1 week, pH 12, 70 \xc2\xb0C). In contrast, 2-pyridyl and 5-thiazolyl boronic acids undergo rapid protodeboronation (t0.5 \xe2\x89\x88 25\xe2\x80\x9350 s, pH 7, 70 \xc2\xb0C), via fragmentation of zwitterionic intermediates. Lewis acid additives (e.g., Cu, Zn salts) can attenuate (2-pyridyl) or accelerate (5-thiazolyl and 5-pyrazolyl) fragmentation. Two additional processes compete when the boronic acid and the boronate are present in sufficient proportions (pH = pKa \xc2\xb1 1.6): (i) self-/autocatalysis and (ii) sequential disproportionations of boronic acid to borinic acid and borane."
"Although an enormous and still growing number of biologically diverse methyltransferases have been reported and identified, a comprehensive understanding of the enzymatic methyl transfer mechanism is still lacking. Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), a member of the family that acts on small metabolites as the substrate, catalyzes methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to glycine to form S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine and sarcosine. We report primary carbon (12C/14C) and secondary (1H3/3H3) kinetic isotope effects at the transferred methyl group, together with 1H3/3H3 binding isotope effects for wild-type GNMT and a series of Tyr21 mutants. The data implicate a compaction effect in the methyl transfer step that is conferred by the protein structure. Furthermore, a remarkable similarity of properties is observed between GNMT and catechol O-methyltransferase, despite significant differences between these enzymes with regard to their active site structures and catalyzed reactions. We attribute these results to a catalytically relevant reduction in the methyl donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor distance that is dependent on a tyrosine side chain positioned behind the methyl-bearing sulfur of AdoMet."
Deprotonative directed ortho cupration of aromatic/heteroaromatic C\xe2\x80\x93H bond and subsequent oxidation with t-BuOOH furnished functionalized phenols in high yields with high regio- and chemoselectivity. DFT calculations revealed that this hydroxylation reaction proceeds via a copper (I \xe2\x86\x92 III \xe2\x86\x92 I) redox mechanism. Application of this reaction to aromatic C\xe2\x80\x93H amination using BnONH2 efficiently afforded the corresponding primary anilines. These reactions show broad scope and good functional group compatibility. Catalytic versions of these transformations are also demonstrated.
"Using mechanistic data from surface science studies on electron-induced reactions of organometallic precursors, cis-Pt(CO)2Cl2 (1) was designed specifically for use in focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID) of Pt nanostructures. Electron induced decomposition of adsorbed 1 under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions proceeds through initial CO loss as determined by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Although the Pt\xe2\x80\x93Cl bonds remain intact during the initial decomposition step, larger electron doses induce removal of the residual chloride through an electron-stimulated desorption process. FEBID structures created from cis-Pt(CO)2Cl2 under steady state deposition conditions in an Auger spectrometer were determined to be PtCl2, free of carbon and oxygen. Coupled with the electron stimulated removal of chlorine demonstrated in the UHV experiments, the Auger deposition data establish a route to FEBID of pure Pt. Results from this study demonstrate that structure\xe2\x80\x93activity relationships can be used to design new precursors specifically for FEBID."
"Solar water-splitting represents an important strategy toward production of the storable and renewable fuel hydrogen. The water oxidation half-reaction typically proceeds with poor efficiency and produces the unprofitable and often damaging product, O2. Herein, we demonstrate an alternative approach and couple solar H2 generation with value-added organic substrate oxidation. Solar irradiation of a cyanamide surface-functionalized melon-type carbon nitride (NCNCNx) and a molecular nickel(II) bis(diphosphine) H2-evolution catalyst (NiP) enabled the production of H2 with concomitant selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols to aldehydes in high yield under purely aqueous conditions, at room temperature and ambient pressure. This one-pot system maintained its activity over 24 h, generating products in 1:1 stoichiometry, separated in the gas and solution phases. The NCNCNx\xe2\x80\x93NiP system showed an activity of 763 \xce\xbcmol (g CNx)\xe2\x88\x921 h\xe2\x80\x931 toward H2 and aldehyde production, a Ni-based turnover frequency of 76 h\xe2\x80\x931, and an external quantum efficiency of 15% (\xce\xbb = 360 \xc2\xb1 10 nm). This precious metal-free and nontoxic photocatalytic system displays better performance than an analogous system containing platinum instead of NiP. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the photoactivity of NCNCNx is due to efficient substrate oxidation of the material, which outweighs possible charge recombination compared to the nonfunctionalized melon-type carbon nitride. Photoexcited NCNCNx in the presence of an organic substrate can accumulate ultralong-lived \xe2\x80\x9ctrapped electrons\xe2\x80\x9d, which allow for fuel generation in the dark. The artificial photosynthetic system thereby catalyzes a closed redox cycle showing 100% atom economy and generates two value-added products, a solar chemical, and solar fuel."
"Peptidoglycan is a fundamental structure for most bacteria. It contributes to the cell morphology and provides cell wall integrity against environmental insults. While several studies have reported a significant degree of variability in the chemical composition and organization of peptidoglycan in the domain Bacteria, the real diversity of this polymer is far from fully explored. This work exploits rapid ultraperformance liquid chromatography and multivariate data analysis to uncover peptidoglycan chemical diversity in the Class Alphaproteobacteria, a group of Gram negative bacteria that are highly heterogeneous in terms of metabolism, morphology and life-styles. Indeed, chemometric analyses revealed novel peptidoglycan structures conserved in Acetobacteria: amidation at the \xce\xb1-(l)-carboxyl of meso-diaminopimelic acid and the presence of muropeptides cross-linked by (1\xe2\x80\x933) l-Ala-d-(meso)-diaminopimelate cross-links. Both structures are growth-controlled modifications that influence sensitivity to Type VI secretion system peptidoglycan endopeptidases and recognition by the Drosophila innate immune system, suggesting relevant roles in the environmental adaptability of these bacteria. Collectively our findings demonstrate the discriminative power of chemometric tools on large cell wall-chromatographic data sets to discover novel peptidoglycan structural properties in bacteria."
"Members of the genus Mycobacterium cause devastating human diseases, including tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can resist some antibiotics because of its durable and impermeable cell envelope. This barrier is assembled from saccharide building blocks not found in mammals, including galactofuranose (Galf). Within the cell envelope, Galf residues are linked together to afford an essential polysaccharide, termed the galactan. The formation of this polymer is catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase GlfT2, a processive carbohydrate polymerase, which generates a sequence-specific polysaccharide with alternating regioisomeric \xce\xb2(1\xe2\x80\x935) and \xce\xb2(1\xe2\x80\x936) Galf linkages. GlfT2 exhibits high fidelity in linkage formation, as it will terminate polymerization rather than deviate from its linkage pattern. These findings suggest that GlfT2 would prefer an acceptor with a canonical alternating \xce\xb2(1\xe2\x80\x935) and \xce\xb2(1\xe2\x80\x936) Galf sequence. To test this hypothesis, we devised a synthetic route to assemble oligosaccharides with natural and non-natural sequences. GlfT2 could elongate each of these acceptors, even those with non-natural linkage patterns. These data indicate that the glycosyltransferase is surprisingly promiscuous in its substrate preferences. However, GlfT2 did favor some substrates: it preferentially acted on those in which the lipid-bearing Galf residue was connected to the sequence by a \xce\xb2(1\xe2\x80\x936) glycosidic linkage. The finding that the relative positioning of the lipid and the non-reducing end of the acceptor influences substrate selectivity is consistent with a role for the lipid in acceptor binding. The data also suggest that the fidelity of GlfT2 for generating an alternating \xce\xb2(1\xe2\x80\x935) and \xce\xb2(1\xe2\x80\x936) pattern of Galf residues arises not from preferential substrate binding but during processive elongation. These observations suggest that inhibiting the action of GlfT2 will afford changes in cell wall structure."
"Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is a widely used biocompatible polymer. We describe a novel epoxide monomer with methyl-thioether moiety, 2-(methylthio)ethyl glycidyl ether (MTEGE), which enables the synthesis of well-defined thioether-functional poly(ethylene glycol). Random and block mPEG-b-PMTEGE copolymers (Mw/Mn = 1.05\xe2\x80\x931.17) were obtained via anionic ring opening polymerization (AROP) with molecular weights ranging from 5\xe2\x80\xaf600 to 12\xe2\x80\xaf000 g\xc2\xb7mol\xe2\x80\x931. The statistical copolymerization of MTEGE with ethylene oxide results in a random microstructure (rEO = 0.92 \xc2\xb1 0.02 and rMTEG\xc2\xa0E = 1.06 \xc2\xb1 0.02), which was confirmed by in situ 1H NMR kinetic studies. The random copolymers are thermoresponsive in aqueous solution, with a wide range of tunable transition temperatures of 88 to 28 \xc2\xb0C. In contrast, mPEG-b-PMTEGE block copolymers formed well-defined micelles (Rh \xe2\x89\x88 9\xe2\x80\x9315 nm) in water, studied by detailed light scattering (DLS and SLS). Intriguingly, the thioether moieties of MTEGE can be selectively oxidized into sulfoxide units, leading to full disassembly of the micelles, as confirmed by detection of pure unimers (DLS and SLS). Oxidation-responsive release of encapsulated Nile Red demonstrates the potential of these micelles as redox-responsive nanocarriers. MTT assays showed only minor effects of the thioethers and their oxidized derivatives on the cellular metabolism of WEHI-164 and HEK-293T cell lines (1\xe2\x80\x931000 \xce\xbcg\xc2\xb7mL\xe2\x80\x931). Further, sulfonium PEG polyelectrolytes can be obtained via alkylation or alkoxylation of MTEGE, providing access to a large variety of functional groups at the charged sulfur atom."
"The dynamic nature of intrinsically disordered peptides makes them a challenge to characterize by solution-phase techniques. In order to gain insight into the relation between the disordered state and the environment, we explore the conformational space of the N-terminal 1\xe2\x80\x935 fragment of bradykinin (BK[1\xe2\x80\x935]2+) in the gas phase by combining drift tube ion mobility, cold-ion spectroscopy, and first-principles simulations. The ion-mobility distribution of BK[1\xe2\x80\x935]2+ consists of two well-separated peaks. We demonstrate that the conformations within the peak with larger cross-section are kinetically trapped, while the more compact peak contains low-energy structures. This is a result of cis\xe2\x80\x93trans isomerization of the two prolyl-peptide bonds in BK[1\xe2\x80\x935]2+. Density-functional theory calculations reveal that the compact structures have two very different geometries with cis\xe2\x80\x93trans and trans\xe2\x80\x93cis backbone conformations. Using the experimental CCSs to guide the conformational search, we find that the kinetically trapped species have a trans\xe2\x80\x93trans configuration. This is consistent with NMR measurements performed in a solution, which show that 82% of the molecules adopt a trans\xe2\x80\x93trans configuration and behave as a random coil."
"The intermediacy of a reduced nickel\xe2\x80\x93iron hydride in hydrogen evolution catalyzed by Ni\xe2\x80\x93Fe complexes was verified experimentally and computationally. In addition to catalyzing hydrogen evolution, the highly basic and bulky (dppv)Ni(\xce\xbc-pdt)Fe(CO)(dppv) ([1]0; dppv = cis-C2H2(PPh2)2) and its hydride derivatives have yielded to detailed characterization in terms of spectroscopy, bonding, and reactivity. The protonation of [1]0 initially produces unsym-[H1]+, which converts by a first-order pathway to sym-[H1]+. These species have C1 (unsym) and Cs (sym) symmetries, respectively, depending on the stereochemistry of the octahedral Fe site. Both experimental and computational studies show that [H1]+ protonates at sulfur. The S = 1/2 hydride [H1]0 was generated by reduction of [H1]+ with Cp*2Co. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that [H1]0 is best described as a Ni(I)\xe2\x80\x93Fe(II) derivative with significant spin density on Ni and some delocalization on S and Fe. EPR spectroscopy reveals both kinetic and thermodynamic isomers of [H1]0. Whereas [H1]+ does not evolve H2 upon protonation, treatment of [H1]0 with acids gives H2. The redox state of the \xe2\x80\x9cremote\xe2\x80\x9d metal (Ni) modulates the hydridic character of the Fe(II)\xe2\x80\x93H center. As supported by DFT calculations, H2 evolution proceeds either directly from [H1]0 and external acid or from protonation of the Fe\xe2\x80\x93H bond in [H1]0 to give a labile dihydrogen complex. Stoichiometric tests indicate that protonation-induced hydrogen evolution from [H1]0 initially produces [1]+, which is reduced by [H1]0. Our results reconcile the required reductive activation of a metal hydride and the resistance of metal hydrides toward reduction. This dichotomy is resolved by reduction of the remote (non-hydride) metal of the bimetallic unit."
"A mixture of ferrocene-based tetratopic pyridyl ligands FcL1 and FcL2 undergoes self-sorting upon competitive coordination with AgBF4, affording homomeric nanotubes FcNT1 and FcNT2 as a mixture. No mutual interference for the nanotubular growth occurred between FcNT1 and FcNT2 even when one of these ligands was used in large excess with respect to the other. 2D X-ray diffraction analysis of unidirectionally oriented nanotube samples, prepared by using the capillary technique, revealed that although FcL1 as reported previously stacks helically in the resulting nanotube FcNT1 FcL2 prefers to stack with no discernible helical twist in FcNT2. Such a difference in their stacking geometries is most likely a major reason for why mixed-ligand metal\xe2\x80\x93organic nanotubes are not constructed upon competitive coordination of FcL1 and FcL2 with AgBF4."
"The Marcus theory of electron transfer predicts a bell-shaped dependence of the reaction rate on the reaction free energy. The top of the \xe2\x80\x9cinverted parabola\xe2\x80\x9d corresponds to zero activation barrier when the electron-transfer reorganization energy and the reaction free energy add up to zero. Although this point has traditionally been reached by altering the chemical structures of donors and acceptors, the theory suggests that it can also be reached by varying other parameters of the system including temperature. We find here dramatic evidence of this phenomenon from experiments on a fullerene\xe2\x80\x93porphyrin dyad. Following photoinduced electron transfer, the rate of charge recombination shows a bell-shaped dependence on the inverse temperature, first increasing with cooling and then decreasing at still lower temperatures. This non-Arrhenius rate law is a result of a strong, approximately hyperbolic temperature variation of the reorganization energy and the reaction free energy. Our results provide potentially the cleanest confirmation of the Marcus energy gap law so far since no modification of the chemical structure is involved."
"In an effort to exert more precise control over structural features of supramolecules, a series of giant concentric hexagons were assembled as discrete structures using tetratopic terpyridine (tpy) ligands. In preparation of tetratopic ligand, pyrylium and pyridinium salts chemistry significantly facilitated synthesis. The key compounds were obtained by condensation reactions of pyrylium salts with corresponding primary amine derivatives in good yields. These discrete metallo-supramolecular concentric hexagons were fully characterized by NMR, ESI\xe2\x80\x93MS, TWIM\xe2\x80\x93MS, and TEM, establishing their hexagon-in-hexagon architectures. The combination of different tetratopic ligands also assembled hybrid concentric hexagons with increasing diversity and complexity. Furthermore, these concentric hexagon supramolecules with precisely controlled shapes and sizes were utilized as building blocks to hierarchically self-assemble supramolecular metal\xe2\x80\x93organic nanoribbons (SMON) at solid\xe2\x80\x93liquid interfaces. Ambient STM imaging showed the formation of long 1D SMON rather than 2D assembly on the basal plane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface after simple dropcasting of the solution of preassembled concentric hexagons onto a freshly cleaved surface of HOPG. This wet chemical method based on self-assembly may offer simple, economical, and scalable routes to deliver complex materials."
"Here we report the development of a versatile 3-acetylamino-2-hydroxypyridine class of ligands that promote meta-C\xe2\x80\x93H arylation of anilines, heterocyclic aromatic amines, phenols, and 2-benzyl heterocycles using norbornene as a transient mediator. More than 120 examples are presented, demonstrating this ligand scaffold enables a wide substrate and coupling partner scope. Meta-C\xe2\x80\x93H arylation with heterocyclic aryl iodides as coupling partners is also realized for the first time using this ligand. The utility for this transformation for drug discovery is showcased by allowing the meta-C\xe2\x80\x93H arylation of a lenalidomide derivative. The first steps toward a silver-free protocol for this reaction are also demonstrated."
"The shikimate pathway of bacteria, fungi, and plants generates chorismate, which is drawn into biosynthetic pathways that form aromatic amino acids and other important metabolites, including folates, menaquinone, and siderophores. Many of the pathways initiated at this branch point transform chorismate using an MST enzyme. The MST enzymes (menaquinone, siderophore, and tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes) are structurally homologous and magnesium-dependent, and all perform similar chemical permutations to chorismate by nucleophilic addition (hydroxyl or amine) at the 2-position of the ring, inducing displacement of the 4-hydroxyl. The isomerase enzymes release isochorismate or aminodeoxychorismate as the product, while the synthase enzymes also have lyase activity that displaces pyruvate to form either salicylate or anthranilate. This has led to the hypothesis that the isomerase and lyase activities performed by the MST enzymes are functionally conserved. Here we have developed tailored pre-steady-state approaches to establish the kinetic mechanisms of the isochorismate and salicylate synthase enzymes of siderophore biosynthesis. Our data are centered on the role of magnesium ions, which inhibit the isochorismate synthase enzymes but not the salicylate synthase enzymes. Prior structural data have suggested that binding of the metal ion occludes access or egress of substrates. Our kinetic data indicate that for the production of isochorismate, a high magnesium ion concentration suppresses the rate of release of product, accounting for the observed inhibition and establishing the basis of the ordered-addition kinetic mechanism. Moreover, we show that isochorismate is channeled through the synthase reaction as an intermediate that is retained in the active site by the magnesium ion. Indeed, the lyase-active enzyme has 3 orders of magnitude higher affinity for the isochorismate complex relative to the chorismate complex. Apparent negative-feedback inhibition by ferrous ions is documented at nanomolar concentrations, which is a potentially physiologically relevant mode of regulation for siderophore biosynthesis in vivo."
We describe a new class of core\xe2\x80\x93shell nanoparticle catalysts having edges and vertexes covered by refractory metal oxide that preferentially segregates onto these catalyst sites. The monolayer shell is deposited on the oxide-free core atoms. The oxide on edges and vertexes induces high catalyst stability and activity. The catalyst and synthesis are exemplified by fabrication of Au nanoparticles doped by Ti atoms that segregate as oxide onto low-coordination sites of edges and vertexes. Pt monolayer shell deposited on Au sites has the mass and specific activities for the oxygen reduction reaction about 13 and 5 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C catalysts. The durability tests show no activity loss after 10\xe2\x80\xaf000 potential cycles from 0.6 to 1.0 V. The superior activity and durability of the Ti\xe2\x80\x93Au@Pt catalyst originate from protective titanium oxide located at the most dissolution-prone edge and vertex sites and Au-supported active and stable Pt shell.
"The development of functional solid-state materials for carbon capture at low carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, namely, from confined spaces (<0.5%) and in particular from air (400 ppm), is of prime importance with respect to energy and environment sustainability. Herein, we report the deliberate construction of a hydrolytically stable fluorinated metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework (MOF), NbOFFIVE-1-Ni, with the appropriate pore system (size, shape, and functionality), ideal for the effective and energy-efficient removal of trace carbon dioxide. Markedly, the CO2-selective NbOFFIVE-1-Ni exhibits the highest CO2 gravimetric and volumetric uptake (ca. 1.3 mmol/g and 51.4 cm3 (STP) cm\xe2\x80\x933) for a physical adsorbent at 400 ppm of CO2 and 298 K. Practically, NbOFFIVE-1-Ni offers the complete CO2 desorption at 328 K under vacuum with an associated moderate energy input of 54 kJ/mol, typical for the full CO2 desorption in conventional physical adsorbents but considerably lower than chemical sorbents. Noticeably, the contracted square-like channels, affording the close proximity of the fluorine centers, permitted the enhancement of the CO2\xe2\x80\x93framework interactions and subsequently the attainment of an unprecedented CO2 selectivity at very low CO2 concentrations. The precise localization of the adsorbed CO2 at the vicinity of the periodically aligned fluorine centers, promoting the selective adsorption of CO2, is evidenced by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction study on NbOFFIVE-1-Ni hosting CO2 molecules. Cyclic CO2/N2 mixed-gas column breakthrough experiments under dry and humid conditions corroborate the excellent CO2 selectivity under practical carbon capture conditions. Pertinently, the notable hydrolytic stability positions NbOFFIVE-1-Ni as the new benchmark adsorbent for direct air capture and CO2 removal from confined spaces."
"Supramolecular construction strategies have overwhelmingly relied on the principles of thermodynamic control. While this approach has yielded an incredibly diverse and striking collection of ensembles, there are downsides, most obviously the necessity to trade-off reversibility against structural integrity. Herein we describe an alternative \xe2\x80\x9cassembly-followed-by-fixing\xe2\x80\x9d approach that possesses the high-yielding, atom-efficient advantages of reversible self-assembly reactions, yet gives structures that possess a covalent-like level of kinetic robustness. We have chosen to exemplify these principles in the preparation of a series of M2L3 helicates and M4L6 tetrahedra. While the rigidity of various bis(bidentate) ligands causes the larger species to be energetically preferred, we are able to freeze the self-assembly process under \xe2\x80\x9cnon-ambient\xe2\x80\x9d conditions, to selectivity give the disfavored M2L3 helicates. We also demonstrate \xe2\x80\x9ckinetic-stimuli\xe2\x80\x9d (redox and light)-induced switching between architectures, notably reconstituting the lower energy tetrahedra into highly distorted helicates."
"Heavily doped semiconductors have recently emerged as a remarkable class of plasmonic alternative to conventional noble metals; however, controlled manipulation of their surface plasmon bands toward short wavelengths, especially in the visible light spectrum, still remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate that hydrogen doped given MoO3 and WO3 via a facile H-spillover approach, namely, hydrogen bronzes, exhibit strong localized surface plasmon resonances in the visible light region. Through variation of their stoichiometric compositions, tunable plasmon resonances could be observed in a wide range, which hinge upon the reduction temperatures, metal species, the nature and the size of metal oxide supports in the synthetic H2 reduction process as well as oxidation treatment in the postsynthetic process. Density functional theory calculations unravel that the intercalation of hydrogen atoms into the given host structures yields appreciable delocalized electrons, enabling their plasmonic properties. The plasmonic hybrids show potentials in heterogeneous catalysis, in which visible light irradiation enhanced catalytic performance toward p-nitrophenol reduction relative to dark condition. Our findings provide direct evidence for achieving plasmon resonances in hydrogen doped metal oxide semiconductors, and may allow large-scale applications with low-price and earth-abundant elements."
"A cesium cation, connecting to 16 fluorine atoms, sets the new record for highest coordination number."
"Biological conversion of natural gas to liquids (Bio-GTL) represents an immense economic opportunity. In nature, aerobic methanotrophic bacteria and anaerobic archaea are able to selectively oxidize methane using methane monooxygenase (MMO) and methyl coenzyme M reductase (MCR) enzymes. Although significant progress has been made toward genetically manipulating these organisms for biotechnological applications, the enzymes themselves are slow, complex, and not recombinantly tractable in traditional industrial hosts. With turnover numbers of 0.16\xe2\x80\x9313 s\xe2\x80\x931, these enzymes pose a considerable upstream problem in the biological production of fuels or chemicals from methane. Methane oxidation enzymes will need to be engineered to be faster to enable high volumetric productivities; however, efforts to do so and to engineer simpler enzymes have been minimally successful. Moreover, known methane-oxidizing enzymes have different expression levels, carbon and energy efficiencies, require auxiliary systems for biosynthesis and function, and vary considerably in terms of complexity and reductant requirements. The pros and cons of using each methane-oxidizing enzyme for Bio-GTL are considered in detail. The future for these enzymes is bright, but a renewed focus on studying them will be critical to the successful development of biological processes that utilize methane as a feedstock."
"Because the majority of environmental bacteria are not easily culturable, access to many bacterially encoded secondary metabolites will be dependent on the development of improved functional metagenomic screening methods. In this study, we examined a collection of diverse Streptomyces species for the best innate ability to heterologously express biosynthetic gene clusters. We then optimized methods for constructing high quality metagenomic cosmid libraries in the best Streptomyces host. An initial screen of a 1.5 million-membered metagenomic library constructed in Streptomyces albus, the species that exhibited the highest propensity for heterologous expression of gene clusters, led to the identification of the novel natural product metatricycloene (1). Metatricycloene is a tricyclic polyene encoded by a reductive, iterative polyketide-like gene cluster. Related gene clusters found in sequenced genomes appear to encode a largely unexplored collection of structurally diverse, polyene-based metabolites."
"The ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins catalyze oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) residues in nucleic acids to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC). These nucleotide bases have been implicated as intermediates on the path to active demethylation, but recent reports have suggested that they might have specific regulatory roles in their own right. In this study, we present kinetic evidence showing that the catalytic domains (CDs) of TET2 and TET1 from mouse and their homologue from Naegleria gruberi, the full-length protein NgTET1, are distributive in both chemical and physical senses, as they carry out successive oxidations of a single 5mC and multiple 5mC residues along a polymethylated DNA substrate. We present data showing that the enzyme neither retains 5hmC/5fC intermediates of preceding oxidations nor slides along a DNA substrate (without releasing it) to process an adjacent 5mC residue. These findings contradict a recent report by Crawford et al. ( J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 730) claiming that oxidation of 5mC by CD of mouse TET2 is chemically processive (iterative). We further elaborate that this distributive mechanism is maintained for TETs in two evolutionarily distant homologues and posit that this mode of function allows the introduction of 5mC forms as epigenetic markers along the DNA."
"Amphiphilic drug formulation additives based on palmitic acid-modified poly(ethylene glycol) (Pal-PEG) are combined with a tailored drug binding peptide that is positioned at the hydrophobic\xe2\x80\x93hydrophilic interface. The peptide originates from combinatorial selection and enables precise modulation of the drug release profiles. While Pal provides a cost-effective reservoir for drug storage, the PEG realizes solubility and shielding. The precision additives reach high payloads close to 1:1, rendering a photosensitizer water-soluble and providing adjustable drug activation kinetics by fine-tuning the peptide interface layer."
"Polymersomes are robust, versatile nanostructures that can be tailored by varying the chemical structure of copolymeric building blocks, giving control over their size, shape, surface chemistry, and membrane permeability. In particular, the generation of nonspherical nanostructures has attracted much attention recently, as it has been demonstrated that shape affects function in a biomedical context. Until now, nonspherical polymersomes have only been constructed from nondegradable building blocks, hampering a detailed investigation of shape effects in nanomedicine for this category of nanostructures. Herein, we demonstrate the spontaneous elongation of spherical polymersomes comprising the biodegradable copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(d,l-lactide) into well-defined nanotubes. The size of these tubes is osmotically controlled using dialysis, which makes them very easy to prepare. To confirm their utility for biomedical applications, we have demonstrated that, alongside drug loading, functional proteins can be tethered to the surface utilizing bio-orthogonal \xe2\x80\x9cclick\xe2\x80\x9d chemistry. In this way the present findings establish a novel platform for the creation of biocompatible, high-aspect ratio nanoparticles for biomedical research."
"A novel asymmetric radical aminotrifluoromethylation of alkenes has been developed for the first time, providing straightforward access to densely functionalized CF3-containing azaheterocycles bearing an \xce\xb1-tertiary stereocenter with excellent enantioselectivity. The key to success is not only the introduction of a Cu(I)/chiral phosphoric acid dual-catalytic system but also the use of urea with two acidic N\xe2\x80\x93H as both the nucleophile and directing group. The utility of this method is illustrated by facile transformations of the products into other important compounds useful in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry."
"Highly selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol with 2-propanol was achieved using SiC-supported Au nanoparticles as photocatalyst. The hydrogenation reached a turnover frequency as high as 487 h\xe2\x80\x931 with 100% selectivity for the production of alcohol under visible light irradiation at 20 \xc2\xb0C. This high performance is attributed to a synergistic effect of localized surface plasmon resonance of Au NPs and charge transfer across the SiC/Au interface. The charged metal surface facilitates the oxidation of 2-propanol to form acetone, while the electron and steric effects at the interface favor the preferred end-adsorption of \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated aldehydes for their selective conversion to unsaturated alcohols. We show that this Au/SiC photocatalyst is capable of hydrogenating a large variety of \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated aldehydes to their corresponding unsaturated alcohols with high conversion and selectivity."
"Here we present a far-red, silicon-rhodamine-based fluorophore (SiR700) for live-cell multicolor imaging. SiR700 has excitation and emission maxima at 690 and 715 nm, respectively. SiR700-based probes for F-actin, microtubules, lysosomes, and SNAP-tag are fluorogenic, cell-permeable, and compatible with superresolution microscopy. In conjunction with probes based on the previously introduced carboxy-SiR650, SiR700-based probes permit multicolor live-cell superresolution microscopy in the far-red, thus significantly expanding our capacity for imaging living cells."
"Studies on the phase segregation of unimolecular block copolymers (BCPs) are limited by a lack of reliable, versatile methods for the synthesis of such polymers on the preparative scale. Herein, we describe an advancement of Iterative Exponential Growth (IEG) wherein chiral allyl-based IEG oligomers are subjected to thiol\xe2\x80\x93ene reactions and converted into unimolecular BCPs. With this strategy we have synthesized uniform BCPs with molar masses up to 12.1 kDa on \xe2\x88\xbc1 g scale. BCPs composed of decane-based side chains and either triethyleneglycol- or thioglycerol-based side chains phase-segregate into hexagonal cylinder morphologies. The assembly is not driven by side-chain crystallization, but is instead the result of amorphous BCP assembly."
"The performance of redox-enhanced electrochemical capacitors (redox ECs) is substantially improved when oxidized catholyte (bromide) and reduced anolyte (viologen) are retained within the porous electrodes through reversible counterion-induced solid complexation. Investigation of the mechanism illustrates design principles and identifies pentyl viologen/bromide (PV/Br) as a new high-performance electrolyte. The symmetric PV/Br redox EC produces a specific energy of 48.5 W\xc2\xb7h/kgdry at 0.5 A/gdry (0.44 kW/kgdry) with 99.7% Coulombic efficiency, maintains stability over 10\xe2\x80\xaf000 cycles, and functions identically when operated with reversed polarity."
"Triplet ground-state organic molecules are interesting with respect to several emerging technologies but typically exhibit limited stability. We report two organic diradicals, one of which possesses a triplet ground state (2J/kB = 234 \xc2\xb1 36 K) and robust stability at elevated temperatures. We are able to sublime this high-spin diradical under high vacuum at 140 \xc2\xb0C with no significant decomposition."
"A new heteroleptic polypyridyle Ru(II) complex was synthesized and deposited on surface by the diazonium electroreduction process. It yields to the covalent grafting of a monolayer. The functionalized surface was characterized by XPS, electrochemistry, AFM, and STM. A precise organization of the molecules within the monolayer is observed with parallel linear stripes separated by a distance of 3.8 nm corresponding to the lateral size of the molecule. Such organization suggests a strong cooperative process in the deposition process. This strategy is an original way to obtain well-controlled and stable functionalized surfaces for potential applications related to the photophysical properties of the grafted chromophore. As an exciting result, it is the first example of a self-organized monolayer (SOM) obtained using diazonium electroreduction."
"A cross-linked polymer containing pendant molecules attached to the polymer framework is shown to form flexible and low-cost membranes, to be a solid Li+ electrolyte up to 270 \xc2\xb0C, much higher than those based on poly(ethylene oxide), to be wetted by a metallic lithium anode, and to be not decomposed by the metallic anode if the anions of the salt are blocked by a ceramic electrolyte in a polymer/ceramic membrane/polymer sandwich electrolyte (PCPSE). In this sandwich architecture, the double-layer electric field at the Li/polymer interface is reduced due to the blocked salt anion transfer. The polymer layer adheres/wets the lithium metal surface and makes the Li-ion flux at the interface more homogeneous. This structure integrates the advantages of the ceramic and polymer. With the PCPSE, all-solid-state Li/LiFePO4 cells showed a notably high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8\xe2\x80\x93100% over 640 cycles."
"This study reports the results of experiments that probed how solvents affect the recombination efficiency (FcP) of geminate radical cage pairs. The macroviscosity of solvents has traditionally been used to make quantitative predictions about FcP, but experiments reported here show that FcP varies dramatically for solvent systems with identical macroviscosities. Experiments show that FcP correlates with the solvent microviscosity: five different solvent systems (consisting of a solvent and a structurally similar viscogen) were examined, and FcP was the same for all five solvent systems at any particular microviscosity. The translational diffusion coefficient of the radicals (measured by DOSY) in the solvent system was used to define the microviscosity of the solvent system."
"We study the compositional dependence of molecular orientation (multipolar) and orbital (quadrupolar) order in the perovskite-like metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks [C(NH2)3]CuxCd1\xe2\x80\x93x(HCOO)3. Upon increasing the fraction x of Jahn\xe2\x80\x93Teller-active Cu2+, we observe an orbital disorder/order transition and a multipolar reorientation transition, each occurring at distinct critical compositions xo = 0.45(5) and xm = 0.55(5). We attribute these transitions to a combination of size, charge distribution, and percolation effects. Our results establish the accessibility in formate perovskites of novel structural degrees of freedom beyond the familiar dipolar terms responsible for (anti)ferroelectric order. We discuss the implications of cooperative quadrupolar and multipolar states for the design of relaxor-like hybrid perovskites."
"We have developed a new fluorescent sensing probe for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by integrating thiazole orange (TO) as a base surrogate into triplex-forming PNA. Our probe forms the thermally stable triplex with the target dsRNA at acidic pH; and the triplex formation is accompanied by the remarkable light-up response of the TO unit. The binding of our probe to the target dsRNA proceeds very rapidly, allowing real-time monitoring of the triplex formation. Importantly, we found the TO base surrogate in our probe functions as a universal base for the base pair opposite the TO unit in the triplex formation. Furthermore, the TO unit is significantly more responsive for the fully matched dsRNA sequence compared to the mismatch-containing sequences, which enables the analysis of the target dsRNA sequence at the single-base pair resolution. The binding and sensing functions of our probe are described for the development of fluorescent probes applicable to sensing biologically relevant dsRNA."
"A series of new mesoporous metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs) made from extended bisbenzenetriazolate linkers exhibit coordinatively unsaturated metal sites that are responsible for high and reversible uptake of ammonia. Isostructural Mn, Co, and Ni materials adsorb 15.47, 12.00, and 12.02 mmol of NH3/g, respectively, at STP. Importantly, these near-record capacities are reversible for at least three cycles. These results demonstrate that azolate MOFs are sufficiently thermally and chemically stable to find uses in recyclable sorption, storage, and potentially separation of chemically challenging and/or corrosive gases, especially when designed to exhibit a high density of open metal sites."
"Experimental techniques that probe the local environment around O in paramagnetic Li-ion cathode materials are essential in order to understand the complex phase transformations and O redox processes that can occur during electrochemical delithiation. While Li NMR is a well-established technique for studying the local environment of Li ions in paramagnetic battery materials, the use of 17O NMR in the same materials has not yet been reported. In this work, we present a combined 17O NMR and hybrid density functional theory study of the local O environments in Li2MnO3, a model compound for layered Li-ion batteries. After a simple 17O enrichment procedure, we observed five resonances with large 17O shifts ascribed to the Fermi contact interaction with directly bonded Mn4+ ions. The five peaks were separated into two groups with shifts at 1600 to 1950 ppm and 2100 to 2450 ppm, which, with the aid of first-principles calculations, were assigned to the 17O shifts of environments similar to the 4i and 8j sites in pristine Li2MnO3, respectively. The multiple O environments in each region were ascribed to the presence of stacking faults within the Li2MnO3 structure. From the ratio of the intensities of the different 17O environments, the percentage of stacking faults was found to be ca. 10%. The methodology for studying 17O shifts in paramagnetic solids described in this work will be useful for studying the local environments of O in a range of technologically interesting transition metal oxides."
"Single crystal reflects the intrinsic physical properties of a material, and single crystals with high-crystalline quality are highly desired for the acquisition of high-performance devices. We found that large single crystals of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) could be grown rapidly from chlorine-containing solutions. Within 5 days, CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) single crystal as large as 20 mm \xc3\x97 18 mm \xc3\x97 6 mm was harvested. As a most important index to evaluate the crystalline quality, the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) in the high-resolution X-ray rocking curve (HR-XRC) of as-grown CH3NH3PbI3(Cl) single crystal was measured as 20 arcsec, which is far superior to so far reported CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals (\xe2\x88\xbc1338 arcsec). The unparalleled crystalline quality delivered a low trap-state density of down to 7.6 \xc3\x97 108 cm\xe2\x80\x933, high carrier mobility of 167 \xc2\xb1 35 cm2 V\xe2\x80\x931 s\xe2\x80\x931, and long transient photovoltaic carrier lifetime of 449 \xc2\xb1 76 \xce\xbcs. The improvement in the crystalline quality, together with the rapid growth rate and excellent carrier transport property, provides state-of-the-art single crystalline hybrid perovskite materials for high-performance optoelectronic devices."
"The design of highly efficient and selective photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction that are based on nonexpensive materials is a great challenge for chemists. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by [Co(qpy)(OH2)2]2+ (1) (qpy = 2,2\xe2\x80\xb2:6\xe2\x80\xb2,2\xe2\x80\xb3:6\xe2\x80\xb3,2\xe2\x80\xb4-quaterpyridine) and [Fe(qpy)(OH2)2]2+ (2) have been investigated. With Ru(bpy)32+ as the photosensitizer and 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole as the sacrificial reductant in CH3CN/triethanolamine solution under visible-light excitation (blue light-emitting diode), a turnover number (TON) for CO as high as 2660 with 98% selectivity can be achieved for the cobalt catalyst. In the case of the iron catalyst, the TON was >3000 with up to 95% selectivity. More significantly, when Ru(bpy)32+ was replaced by the organic dye sensitizer purpurin, TONs of 790 and 1365 were achieved in N,N-dimethylformamide for the cobalt and iron catalysts, respectively."
"A new orthogonal solid-phase iterative strategy is proposed for the synthesis of sequence-coded polymers. This approach relies on the use of two successive chemoselective steps: (i) phosphoramidite coupling, and (ii) radical\xe2\x80\x93radical coupling. These repeated steps can be performed using two different types of building blocks, i.e. a phosphoramidite monomer that also contains an alkyl bromide and a hydroxy-functionalized nitroxide. The phosphoramidite and the hydroxy group are reacted in step (i), thus leading to a phosphite that is oxidized in situ into a phosphate bond. The alkyl bromide is activated by copper bromide in step (ii) to afford a carbon-centered radical that is spin-trapped in situ by the nitroxide. The iterative repetition of these steps allow synthesis of uniform polymers, as evidenced by high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry. Moreover, binary information could be easily implemented in the polymers using different types of phosphoramidite monomers in step (i). Interestingly, it was found that the formed information-containing polymers are very easy to sequence by tandem mass spectrometry due to the presence of easily cleavable alkoxyamine bonds formed in step (ii)."
"Discotic mesogens containing the benzo[e][1,2,4]triazinyl radical as the central unit exhibit a Colh phase below 80 \xc2\xb0C. Depending on the substituent at the N(1) position, they show different modes of thermal expansion and magnetic behavior, presumably due to differences in molecular organization. Thus, for 1-phenyl (1a) and 1-PhF-m (1b) derivatives, the Colh phase has positive thermal expansion coefficient \xce\xba and antiferromagnetic interactions, while for the 1-(3,4,5-(C12H25X)3C6H2) derivatives 1c (X = O) and 1d (X = S), \xce\xba is negative and weak ferromagnetic interactions in the crystalline phase are observed for 1c (J/kB = +4.76 K). Compounds 1a and 1c exhibit photoinduced hole transport (\xce\xbc \xe2\x89\x88 1.3 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x933 cm2 V\xe2\x80\x931 s\xe2\x80\x931) in the Colh phase."
"An expedient, practical, and enantioselective route to the highly congested ent-kaurane diterpene maoecrystal V is presented. This route, which has been several years in the making, is loosely modeled after a key pinacol shift in the proposed biosynthesis. Only 11 steps, many of which are strategic in that they build key skeletal bonds and incorporate critical functionalities, are required to access (\xe2\x88\x92)-maoecrystal V. Several unique and unexpected maneuvers are featured in this potentially scalable pathway. Reevaluation of the biological activity calls into question the initial exuberance surrounding this natural product."
"The development of a highly enantioselective catalytic oxa-Pictet\xe2\x80\x93Spengler reaction has proven a great challenge for chemical synthesis. We now report the first example of such a process, which was realized by utilizing a nitrated confined imidodiphosphoric acid catalyst. Our approach provides substituted isochroman derivatives from both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. DFT calculations provide insight into the reaction mechanism."
"The first bismuth selenite fluoride, BiFSeO3, was obtained by aliovalent substitution of 2D BiOIO3. Its structure features a 3D network composed of 1D [BiF]2+ chains interconnected by SeO3 groups. BiFSeO3 exhibits a very strong second harmonic generation (SHG) effect of about 13.5 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP) under 1064 nm laser radiation and 1.1 times that of KTiOPO4 (KTP) under 2.05 \xce\xbcm laser radiation, which is the highest among all of the metal selenites reported. It has also very simple chemical composition and can be synthesized easily under mild hydrothermal conditions."
"Gold in the +III oxidation state (AuIII) has been proposed as a promising species to mediate challenging chemical reactions. However, it is difficult to characterize the chemistry of individual AuIII species in condensed-phase systems mainly due to the interference from the AuI counterpart. Herein, by doping Au atoms into gas-phase vanadium oxide clusters, we demonstrate that the AuIII cation in the AuV2O6+ cluster is active for activation and transformation of methane, the most stable alkane molecule, into formaldehyde under mild conditions. In contrast, the AuV2O6+ cluster isomers with the AuI cation can only absorb CH4. The clusters were generated by laser ablation and mass selected to react with CH4, CD4, or CH2D2 in an ion trap reactor. The reactivity was characterized by mass spectrometry and quantum chemistry calculations. The structures of the reactant and product ions were identified by using collision-induced and 425 nm photo-induced dissociation techniques."
"Cesium bis(perfluoro-triphenylborane)amide, Cs[H2NB2(C6F5)6] (1), has been prepared by the reaction of sodium salt and CsF in dichloromethane and water. The compound is exceptional for a [H2NB2(C6F5)6]\xe2\x88\x92 salt in that it contains a monatomic solute-free cation. Determination of the molecular structure revealed a novel C2 symmetrical conformation of the weakly coordinating [H2NB2(C6F5)6]\xe2\x88\x92 anion, which gives rise to an unprecedented 16-coordinate (CN 16) Cs+ cation in a likewise unprecedented tetracosahedral arrangement of F atoms. The poor solubility of 1 allows nearly quantitative separation of Cs+ from water, which suggests potential applications as an effective 134/137Cs remover from nuclear waste solutions, administration as an antidote for 134/137Cs poisoning, and use for 131/137Cs radiotherapy (brachytherapy). Rb[H2NB2(C6F5)6]\xc2\xb7CH2Cl2 (2) has also been characterized, featuring two inequivalent Rb+ cations having CN 10, one of which involves Rb+(\xce\xb72-Cl2CH2)2 coordination."
"Lysine methylation is an important histone post-translational modification (PTM) for manipulating chromatin structure and regulating gene expression, and its dysregulation is associated with various diseases including many cancers. While characterization of Lys methylation has seen improvements over the past decade due to advances in proteomic mass spectrometry and methods involving antibodies, chemical methods for selective detection of proteins containing PTMs are still lacking. Here, we detail the development of a unique labeling method wherein a synthetic receptor probe for trimethyl lysine (Kme3), CX4-ONBD, is used to direct selective fluorescent labeling of Kme3 histone peptides. This supramolecular approach reverses the paradigm of ligand-directed affinity labeling by making the receptor the synthetic component and the ligand the component to be labeled. We show that the probe mediates a strong turn-on fluorescence response in the presence of a Kme3 histone peptide and shows >5-fold selectivity in covalent labeling over an unmethylated lysine peptide. We also demonstrate the utility of the probe through the design of a turn-on fluorescence assay for histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and for inhibitor screening and IC50 determination. Our synthetic receptor-mediated affinity labeling approach broadens the scope of PTM detection by chemical means and may facilitate the development of more versatile in vitro enzymatic assays."
"A series of fluorinated Ir(III)\xe2\x80\x93terpyridine\xe2\x80\x93phenylpyridine\xe2\x80\x93X (X = anionic monodentate ligand) complexes were synthesized by selective C\xe2\x80\x93F activation, whereby perfluorinated phenylpyridines were readily complexed. The combination of fluorinated phenylpyridine ligands with an electron-rich tri-tert-butyl terpyridine ligand generates a \xe2\x80\x9cpush\xe2\x80\x93pull\xe2\x80\x9d force on the electrons upon excitation, imparting significant enhancements to the stability, electrochemical, and photophysical properties of the complexes. Application of the complexes as photosensitizers for photocatalytic generation of hydrogen from water and as redox photocatalysts for decarboxylative fluorination of several carboxylic acids showcases the performance of the complexes in highly coordinating solvents, in some cases exceeding that of the leading photosensitizers. Changes in the photophysical properties and the nature of the excited states are observed as the compounds increase in fluorination as well as upon exchange of the ancillary chloride ligand to a cyanide. These changes in the excited states have been corroborated using density functional theory modeling."
"Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) belongs to a large class of proteins that solubilize lipids for physiological transport. Humans have three different APOE alleles, APOE \xce\xb52, APOE \xce\xb53, and APOE \xce\xb54, and genetic studies identified ApoE4 as the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease (AD). People who are homozygous for ApoE4 (i.e., ApoE4/E4) are an order of magnitude more likely to develop late-onset AD (LOAD) than ApoE3/E3 carriers. Several differences between ApoE3 and ApoE4 may contribute to AD including the observation that ApoE4 is degraded to a greater extent than ApoE3 in the human brain. Experiments with high-temperature requirement serine peptidase A1 (HtrA1), which is found in the nervous system, demonstrate that HtrA1 is an allele-selective ApoE-degrading enzyme that degrades ApoE4 more quickly than ApoE3. This activity is specific to HtrA1, as similar assays with HtrA2 showed minimal ApoE4 proteolysis and trypsin had no preference between ApoE4 and ApoE3. HtrA1 has also been reported to cleave the tau protein (Tau) and the amyloid protein precursor (APP) to hinder the formation of toxic amyloid deposits associated with AD. Competition assays with ApoE4, ApoE3, and Tau revealed that ApoE4 inhibits Tau degradation. Thus, the identification of ApoE4 as an in vitro HtrA1 substrate suggests a potential biochemical mechanism that links ApoE4 regulation of AD proteins such as Tau."
"Ti/Ge distribution in rhombohedral LiTi2\xe2\x80\x93xGex(PO4)3 NASICON series has been analyzed by 31P magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Nuclear magnetic resonance is an excellent probe to follow Ti/Ge disorder, as it is sensitive to the atomic scale environment without long-range periodicity requirements. In the samples considered here, PO4 units are surrounded by four Ti/Ge octahedra, and then, five different components ascribed to P(OTi)4, P(OTi)3(OGe), P(OTi)2(OGe)2, P(OTi)(OGe)3, and P(OGe)4 environments are expected in 31P MAS NMR spectra of R3\xcc\x85c NASICON samples. However, 31P MAS NMR spectra of analyzed series display a higher number of signals, suggesting that, although the overall symmetry remains R3\xcc\x85c, partial substitution causes a local decrement in symmetry. With the aid of first-principles DFT calculations, 10 detected 31P NMR signals have been assigned to different Ti4\xe2\x80\x93nGen arrangements in the R3 subgroup symmetry. In this assignment, the influence of octahedra of the same or different R2(PO4)3 structural units has been considered. The influence of bond distances, angles and atom charges on 31P NMR chemical shieldings has been discussed. Simulation of the LiTi2\xe2\x80\x93xGex(PO4)3 series suggests that detection of 10 P environments is mainly due to the existence of two oxygen types, O1 and O2, whose charges are differently affected by Ge and Ti occupation of octahedra. From the quantitative analysis of detected components, a random Ti/Ge distribution has been deduced in next nearest neighbor (NNN) sites that surround tetrahedral PO4 units. This random distribution was supported by XRD data displaying Vegard\xe2\x80\x99s law."
"The catalytic C\xe2\x80\x93H borylation of arenes with HBpin (pin = pinacolate) using POCOP-type pincer complexes of Ir has been demonstrated, with turnover numbers exceeding 10\xe2\x80\xaf000 in some cases. The selectivity of C\xe2\x80\x93H activation was based on steric preferences and largely mirrored that found in other Ir borylation catalysts. Catalysis in the (POCOP)Ir system depends on the presence of stoichiometric quantities of sacrificial olefin, which is hydrogenated to consume the H2 equivalents generated in the borylation of C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds with HBpin. Smaller olefins such as ethylene or 1-hexene were more advantageous to catalysis than sterically encumbered tert-butylethylene (TBE). Olefin hydroboration is a competing side reaction. The synthesis and isolation of multiple complexes potentially relevant to catalysis permitted examination of several key elementary reactions. These experiments indicate that the C\xe2\x80\x93H activation step in catalysis ostensibly involves oxidative addition of an aromatic C\xe2\x80\x93H bond to the three-coordinate (POCOP)Ir species. The olefin is mechanistically critical to gain access to this 14-electron, monovalent Ir intermediate. C\xe2\x80\x93H activation at Ir(I) here is in contrast to the olefin-free catalysis with state-of-the-art Ir complexes supported by neutral bidentate ligands, where the C\xe2\x80\x93H activating step is understood to involve trivalent Ir-boryl intermediates."
"The construction of a multivalent ligand is an effective way to increase affinity and selectivity toward biomolecular targets with multiple-ligand binding sites. Adopting this strategy, we used a known cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) mimic as a scaffold to develop a series of multivalent ligand constructs that bind to the expanded dCTG (CTGexp) and rCUG nucleotide repeats (CUGexp) known to cause myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1), an incurable neuromuscular disease. By assembling this polyvalent construct, the hydrophobic ligands are solubilized and delivered into cell nuclei, and their enhanced binding affinity leads to the inhibition of ribonuclear foci formation and a reversal of splicing defects, all at low concentrations. Some of the multivalent ligands are shown to inhibit selectively the in vitro transcription of (CTG\xc2\xb7CAG)74, to reduce the concentration of the toxic CUG RNA in DM1 model cells, and to show phenotypic improvement in vivo in a Drosophila model of DM1. This strategy may be useful in drug design for other trinucleotide repeat disorders and more broadly for intracellular multivalent targeting."
"A ruthenium(II) complex, [Ru(dmdmp)Cl(MeBPA)] (2) (Hdmdmp = N,N-dimethyl-6,7-dimethylpterin, MeBPA = N-methyl-N,N-bis(pyridylmethyl)amine), having a pterin derivative as a proton-accepting ligand, was synthesized and characterized. Complex 2 shows higher basicity than that of a previously reported RuII-pterin complex, [Ru(dmdmp) (TPA)]+ (1) (TPA = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine). On the other hand, 1e\xe2\x80\x93-oxidized species of 1 (1OX) exhibits higher electron-acceptability than that of 1e\xe2\x80\x93-oxidized 2 (2OX). Bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE) of the two RuII complexes having Hdmdmp as a ligand in proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) to generate 1OX and 2OX were calculated to be 85 kcal mol\xe2\x80\x931 for 1OX and 78 kcal mol\xe2\x80\x931 for 2OX. The BDE values are large enough to perform H atom transfer from C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds of organic molecules to the 1e\xe2\x80\x93-oxidized complexes through PCET. The second-order rate constants (k) of PCET oxidation reactions were determined for 1OX and 2OX. The logarithms of normalized k values were proportional to the BDE values of C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds of the substrates with slopes of \xe2\x88\x920.27 for 1OX and \xe2\x88\x920.44 for 2OX. The difference between 1OX and 2OX in the slopes suggests that the transition states in PCET oxidations of substrates by the two complexes bear different polarization, as reflection of difference in the electron acceptability and basicity of 1OX and 2OX. The more basic 2OX attracts a proton from a C\xe2\x80\x93H bond via a more polarized transition state than that of 1OX; on the contrary, the more electron-deficient 1OX forms less polarized transition states in PCET oxidation reactions of C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds."
"The stereospecific cross-coupling of secondary boronic esters with sp2 electrophiles (Suzuki\xe2\x80\x93Miyaura reaction) is a long-standing problem in synthesis, but progress has been achieved in specific cases using palladium catalysis. However, related couplings with tertiary boronic esters are not currently achievable. To address this general problem, we have focused on an alternative method exploiting the reactivity of a boronate complex formed between an aryl lithium and a boronic ester. We reasoned that subsequent addition of an oxidant or an electrophile would remove an electron from the aromatic ring or react in a Friedel\xe2\x80\x93Crafts-type manner, respectively, generating a cationic species, which would trigger 1,2-migration of the boron substituent, creating the new C\xe2\x80\x93C bond. Elimination (preceded by further oxidation in the former case) would result in rearomatization giving the coupled product stereospecifically. Initial work was examined with 2-furyllithium. Although the oxidants tested were unsuccessful, electrophiles, particularly NBS, enabled the coupling reaction to occur in good yield with a broad range of secondary and tertiary boronic esters, bearing different steric demands and functional groups (esters, azides, nitriles, alcohols, and ethers). The reaction also worked well with other electron-rich heteroaromatics and 6-membered ring aromatics provided they had donor groups in the meta position. Conditions were also found under which the B(pin)- moiety could be retained in the product, ortho to the boron substituent. This protocol, which created a new C(sp2)\xe2\x80\x93C(sp3) and an adjacent C\xe2\x80\x93B bond, was again applicable to a range of secondary and tertiary boronic esters. In all cases, the coupling reaction occurred with complete stereospecificity. Computational studies verified the competing processes involved and were in close agreement with the experimental observations."
"The successful synthesis of highly syndiotactic polar vinyl polymers bearing the reactive pendant vinyl group on each repeat unit, which is enabled by perfectly chemoselective and highly syndiospecific coordination polymerization of divinyl polar monomers developed through this work, has allowed the construction of robust cross-linked supramolecular stereocomplexes and C60 inclusion complexes. The metal-mediated coordination polymerization of three representative polar divinyl monomers, including vinyl methacrylate (VMA), allyl methacrylate (AMA), and N,N-diallyl acrylamide (DAA) by Cs-ligated zirconocenium ester enolate catalysts under ambient conditions exhibits complete chemoselectivity and high stereoselectivity, thus producing the corresponding vinyl-functionalized polymers with high (92% rr) to quantitative (>99% rr) syndiotacticity. A combined experimental (synthetic, kinetic, and mechanistic) and theoretical (DFT) investigation has yielded a unimetallic, enantiomorphic-site-controlled propagation mechanism. Postfunctionalization of the obtained syndiotactic vinyl-functionalized polymers via the thiol\xe2\x80\x93ene click and photocuring reactions readily produced the corresponding thiolated polymers and flexible cross-linked thin-film materials, respectively. Complexation of such syndiotactic vinyl-functionalized polymers with isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate) and fullerene C60 generates supramolecular crystalline helical stereocomplexes and inclusion complexes, respectively. Cross-linking of such complexes affords robust cross-linked stereocomplexes that are solvent-resistant and also exhibit considerably enhanced thermal and mechanical properties compared with the un-cross-linked stereocomplexes."
"Determination of relative configuration is frequently a rate-limiting step in the characterization of small organic molecules. Solution NMR-based nuclear Overhauser effect and scalar J-coupling constants can provide useful spatial information but often fail when stereocenters are separated by more than 4\xe2\x80\x935 \xc3\x85. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) can provide a means of assigning relative configuration without limits of distance between stereocenters. However, sensitivity limits their application. Chemical shift is the most readily measured NMR parameter, and partial molecular alignment can reveal the anisotropic component of the chemical shift tensor, manifested as residual chemical shift anisotropy (RCSA). Hence, 13C RCSAs provide information on the relative orientations of specific structural moieties including nonprotonated carbons and can be used for stereochemical assignment. Herein, we present two robust and sensitive methods to accurately measure and apply 13C RCSAs for stereochemical assignment. The complementary techniques are demonstrated with five molecules representing differing structural classes."
"Energy transfer (EnT) of near-infrared (NIR) excitons enables applications in harvesting of solar energy and biological imaging. Fast exciton extraction from NIR-absorbing Pb-chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) may allow utilization of the photon downconversion (multiple exciton generation) process that occurs in those QDs to amplify signal in QD-based sensors or photocurrent in QD-based photovoltaics. This paper describes subnanosecond extraction of NIR excitons from PbS QDs by adsorbed J-aggregates of cyanine dye in aqueous dispersions. The QD/J-aggregate complexes form through electrostatic self-assembly, and the rate and yield of EnT within the complexes can be optimized by adjusting spectral overlap between QD emission and the J-aggregate absorption, which are controlled by density of charged ligands on the QD surface and the pH. The primary EnT pathways have rate constants ranging from (800 ps)\xe2\x88\x921 to (2.2 ns)\xe2\x88\x921, which are 1\xe2\x80\x932 orders of magnitude faster than previously reported examples with PbS QDs as exciton donors. The fastest EnT process occurs in 90 ps and is potentially competitive with Auger recombination of biexcitonic states in PbS QDs."
"We have investigated the reaction between O2 and H2O, coadsorbed on the (101) surface of a reduced TiO2 anatase single crystal by scanning tunneling microscopy, density functional theory, temperature-programmed desorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. While water adsorbs molecularly on the anatase (101) surface, the reaction with O2 results in water dissociation and formation of terminal OH groups. We show that these terminal OHs are the final and stable reaction product on reduced anatase. We identify OOH as a metastable intermediate in the reaction. The water dissociation reaction runs as long as the surface can transfer enough electrons to the adsorbed species; the energy balance and activation barriers for the individual reaction steps are discussed, depending on the number of electrons available. Our results indicate that the presence of donor dopants can significantly reduce activation barriers for oxygen reduction on anatase."
"Nanoscopic gold particles have gained very high interest because of their promising catalytic activity for various chemicals reactions. Among these reactions, low-temperature CO oxidation is the most extensively studied one due to its practical relevance in environmental applications and the fundamental problems associated with its very high activity at low temperatures. Gold nanoparticles supported on manganese oxide belong to the most active gold catalysts for CO oxidation. Among a variety of manganese oxides, Mn2O3 is considered to be the most favorable support for gold nanoparticles with respect to catalytic activity. Gold on MnO2 has been shown to be significantly less active than gold on Mn2O3 in previous work. In contrast to these previous studies, in a comprehensive study of gold nanoparticles on different manganese oxides, we developed a gold catalyst on MnO2 nanostructures with extremely high activity. Nanosized gold particles (2\xe2\x80\x933 nm) were supported on \xce\xb1-MnO2 nanowires and mesoporous \xce\xb2-MnO2 nanowire arrays. The materials were extremely active at very low temperature (\xe2\x88\x9280 \xc2\xb0C) and also highly stable at 25 \xc2\xb0C (70 h) under normal conditions for CO oxidation. The specific reaction rate of 2.8 molCO\xc2\xb7h\xe2\x80\x931\xc2\xb7gAu\xe2\x80\x931 at a temperature as low as \xe2\x88\x9285 \xc2\xb0C is almost 30 times higher than that of the most active Au/Mn2O3 catalyst."
"The structure and folding of a protein in solution depends on noncovalent interactions within the protein and those with surrounding ions and molecules. Decoupling these interactions in solution is challenging, which has hindered the development of accurate physics-based models for structure prediction. Investigations of proteins in the gas phase can be used to selectively decouple factors affecting the structures of proteins. Here, we use cation-to-anion proton-transfer reactions (CAPTR) to reduce the charge states of denatured ubiquitin ions in the gas phase, and ion mobility to probe their structures. In CAPTR, a precursor charge state is selected (P) and reacted with monoanions to generate charge-reduced product ions (C). Following each CAPTR event, denatured ubiquitin ions (13+ to 6+) yield products that rapidly isomerize to structures that have smaller collision cross sections (\xce\xa9). The \xce\xa9 values of CAPTR product ions depend strongly on C and very weakly on P. Pre- and post-CAPTR activation was then used to probe the potential-energy surfaces of the precursor and product ions, respectively. Post-CAPTR activation showed that ions of different P fold differently and populate different regions of the potential-energy surface of that ion. Finally, pre-CAPTR activation showed that the structures of protein ions can be indirectly investigated using ion mobility of their CAPTR product ions, even for subtle structural differences that are not apparent from ion mobility characterization of the activated precursor ions. More generally, these results show that CAPTR strongly complements existing techniques for characterizing the structures and dynamics of biological molecules in the gas phase."
"The self-assembly of peptides and peptide mimetics into supramolecular polymers has been established in recent years as a route to biocompatible nanomaterials with novel mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. The morphologies of the resulting polymers are usually dictated by the strengths as well as lifetimes of the noncovalent bonds that lead to the formation of the structures. Together with an often incomplete understanding of the assembly mechanisms, these factors limit the control over the formation of polymers with tailored structures. Here, we have developed a microfluidic flow reactor to measure growth rates directly and accurately on the axial and radial faces of crystalline peptide supramolecular polymers. We show that the structures grow through two-dimensional nucleation mechanisms, with rates that depend exponentially on the concentration of soluble peptide. Using these mechanistic insights into the growth behavior of the axial and radial faces, we have been able to tune the aspect ratio of populations of dipeptide assemblies. These results demonstrate a general strategy to control kinetically self-assembly beyond thermodynamic products governed by the intrinsic properties of the building blocks in order to attain the required morphology and function."
"Iron porphyrin carbenes constitute a new frontier of species with considerable synthetic potential. Exquisitely engineered myoglobin and cytochrome P450 enzymes can generate these complexes and facilitate the transformations they mediate. The current work harnesses density functional theoretical methods to provide insight into the electronic structure, formation, and N\xe2\x80\x93H insertion reactivity of an iron porphyrin carbene, [Fe(Por)(SCH3)(CHCO2Et)]\xe2\x88\x92, a model of a complex believed to exist in an experimentally studied artificial metalloenzyme. The ground state electronic structure of the terminal form of this complex is an open-shell singlet, with two antiferromagnetically coupled electrons residing on the iron center and carbene ligand. As we shall reveal, the bonding properties of [Fe(Por)(SCH3)(CHCO2Et)]\xe2\x80\x93 are remarkably analogous to those of ferric heme superoxide complexes. The carbene forms by dinitrogen loss from ethyl diazoacetate. This reaction occurs preferentially through an open-shell singlet transition state: iron donates electron density to weaken the C\xe2\x80\x93N bond undergoing cleavage. Once formed, the iron porphyrin carbene accomplishes N\xe2\x80\x93H insertion via nucleophilic attack. The resulting ylide then rearranges, using an internal carbonyl base, to form an enol that leads to the product. The findings rationalize experimentally observed reactivity trends reported in artificial metalloenzymes employing iron porphyrin carbenes. Furthermore, these results suggest a possible expansion of enzymatic substrate scope, to include aliphatic amines. Thus, this work, among the first several computational explorations of these species, contributes insights and predictions to the surging interest in iron porphyrin carbenes and their synthetic potential."
"This work demonstrates the effect of electrostatic interactions on the electroactivity of a persistent organic free radical. This was achieved by chemisorption of molecules of 4-azido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperdinyloxy (4-azido-TEMPO) onto monolayer-modified Si(100) electrodes using a two-step chemical procedure to preserve the open-shell state and hence the electroactivity of the nitroxide radical. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the surface electrochemical reaction are investigated experimentally and analyzed with the aid of electrochemical digital simulations and quantum-chemical calculations of a theoretical model of the tethered TEMPO system. Interactions between the electrolyte anions and the TEMPO grafted on highly doped, i.e., metallic, electrodes can be tuned to predictably manipulate the oxidizing power of surface nitroxide/oxoammonium redox couple, hence showing the practical importance of the electrostatics on the electrolyte side of the radical monolayer. Conversely, for monolayers prepared on the poorly doped electrodes, the electrostatic interactions between the tethered TEMPO units and the semiconductor-side, i.e., space-charge, become dominant and result in drastic kinetic changes to the electroactivity of the radical monolayer as well as electrochemical nonidealities that can be explained as an increase in the self-interaction \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d parameter that leads to the Frumkin isotherm."
"The remarkable consequences in elongation, dynamic character, response to external stimuli (e.g., solvent effects, metal cations), and aggregation observed in helical poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) when either the type of linkage with the pendant groups (i.e., anilide, benzamide) or the aromatic substitution pattern (i.e., ortho, meta, para) of the parent phenylacetylene monomer undergo modification are analyzed in depth. Two series of PPAs substituted at the phenyl ring in ortho, meta, and para with either (S)-\xce\xb1-methoxy-\xce\xb1-phenylacetic acid (MPA) or (S)-phenylglycine methyl ester (PGME) linked through anilide or benzamide bonds were prepared (i.e., o-, m-, p-poly-1 and poly-2 series) and characterized both in solution and in the solid state (CD, UV\xe2\x80\x93vis, Raman, NMR, DSC, TGA, X-ray, AFM, SEM). Para-substituted polymers (p-poly-1 and p-poly-2) present the most compressed and dynamic helices, which respond easily to external stimuli. Meta-substituted PPAs (m-poly-1 and m-poly-2) exist as a mixture in equilibrium of two different helices (compressed and stretched), both less dynamic than the para counterparts and with a weak response to external stimuli. Moreover, in the solid state, m-poly-1 and m-poly-2 show separate fields for the compressed and for the stretched helices. For its part, the ortho-substituted PPA (o-poly-1) presents a highly stretched, almost planar and practically rigid helical structure, inert to external stimuli and prone to aggregate. These structural changes (elongation/dynamic behavior) are rationalized on the basis of the increasing difficulties imposed by the meta- and ortho-substitution on the accommodation of the pendants within the helical structure."
"Curvature prevalently exists in the world of carbon materials (e.g., fullerenes, buckyl bowls, carbon nanotubes, and onions), but traditional C2-addition mechanisms fail to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the formation of carbon curvature starting from a pentagonal carbon ring in currently available chemical-physical processes such as combustion. Here, we show a complete series of nascent pentagon-incorporating C5\xe2\x80\x93C18 that are online produced in the flame of acetylene\xe2\x80\x93cyclopentadiene\xe2\x80\x93oxygen and in situ captured by C60 or trapped as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for clarifying the growth of the curved subunit of C20H10. A mechanism regarding C1-substitution and C2-addition has been proposed for understanding the formation of curvature in carbon materials, as exemplified by the typical curved molecule containing a single pentagon completely surrounded by five hexagons. The present mechanism, supported by the intermediates characterized by X-ray crystallography as well as NMR, has been experimentally validated for the rational synthesis of curved molecule in the commercially useful combustion process."
"The long-range influence of ions in solution on the water hydrogen-bond (H-bond) network remains a topic of vigorous debate. Recent spectroscopic and theoretical studies have, for the most part, reached the consensus that weakly coordinating ions only affect water molecules in the first hydration shell. Here, we apply ultrafast broadband two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy to aqueous nitrate and carbonate in neat H2O to study the solvation structure and dynamics of ions on opposite ends of the Hofmeister series. By exciting both the water OH stretches and ion stretches and probing the associated cross-peaks between them, we are afforded a comprehensive view into the complex nature of ion hydration. We show in aqueous nitrate that weak ion\xe2\x80\x93water H-bonding leads to water\xe2\x80\x93water interactions in the ion solvation shells dominating the dynamics. In contrast, the carbonate CO stretches show significant mixing with the water OH stretches due to strong ion\xe2\x80\x93water H-bonding such that the water and ion modes are intimately correlated. Further, the excitonic nature of vibrations in neat H2O, which spans multiple water molecules, is an important factor in describing ion hydration. We attribute these complex dynamics to the likely presence of intermediate-range effects influenced by waters beyond the first solvation shell."
"A new strategy was developed by using a polymer ligand, poly(isophthalic acid)(ethylene oxide), to modulate the growth of metal\xe2\x80\x93organic polyhedra (MOP) crystals. This macromolecular modulator can effectively control the crystal habit of several different Cu24L24 (L = isophthalic acid derivatives) MOPs. The polymer also directed the formation of MOP structures under reaction conditions that only produce metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks in the absence of modulator. Moreover, the polymer also enabled the deposition of MOP crystals on glass surfaces. This macromolecular modulator strategy provides an innovative approach to control the morphology and assembly of MOP particles."
"Current static-state explorations of organic semiconductors for optimal material properties and device performance are hindered by limited insights into the dynamically changed molecular states and charge transport and energy transfer processes upon device operation. Here, we propose a simple yet successful strategy, resonance variation-based dynamic adaptation (RVDA), to realize optimized self-adaptive properties in donor\xe2\x80\x93resonance\xe2\x80\x93acceptor molecules by engineering the resonance variation for dynamic tuning of organic semiconductors. Organic light-emitting diodes hosted by these RVDA materials exhibit remarkably high performance, with external quantum efficiencies up to 21.7% and favorable device stability. Our approach, which supports simultaneous realization of dynamically adapted and selectively enhanced properties via resonance engineering, illustrates a feasible design map for the preparation of smart organic semiconductors capable of dynamic structure and property modulations, promoting the studies of organic electronics from static to dynamic."
"Amyloid-\xce\xb2 (A\xce\xb2) is a 39\xe2\x80\x9342 residue protein produced by the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which subsequently aggregates to form cross-\xce\xb2 amyloid fibrils that are a hallmark of Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease (AD). The most prominent forms of A\xce\xb2 are A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9340 and A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9342, which differ by two amino acids (I and A) at the C-terminus. However, A\xce\xb242 is more neurotoxic and essential to the etiology of AD. Here, we present an atomic resolution structure of a monomorphic form of A\xce\xb2M01\xe2\x80\x9342 amyloid fibrils derived from over 500 13C\xe2\x80\x9313C, 13C\xe2\x80\x9315N distance and backbone angle structural constraints obtained from high field magic angle spinning NMR spectra. The structure (PDB ID: 5KK3) shows that the fibril core consists of a dimer of A\xce\xb242 molecules, each containing four \xce\xb2-strands in a S-shaped amyloid fold, and arranged in a manner that generates two hydrophobic cores that are capped at the end of the chain by a salt bridge. The outer surface of the monomers presents hydrophilic side chains to the solvent. The interface between the monomers of the dimer shows clear contacts between M35 of one molecule and L17 and Q15 of the second. Intermolecular 13C\xe2\x80\x9315N constraints demonstrate that the amyloid fibrils are parallel in register. The RMSD of the backbone structure (Q15\xe2\x80\x93A42) is 0.71 \xc2\xb1 0.12 \xc3\x85 and of all heavy atoms is 1.07 \xc2\xb1 0.08 \xc3\x85. The structure provides a point of departure for the design of drugs that bind to the fibril surface and therefore interfere with secondary nucleation and for other therapeutic approaches to mitigate A\xce\xb242 aggregation."
"The use of the interior of self-assembled membrane as a template for polymer synthesis and assembly has long attracted the interest of chemists. However, it is difficult to utilize a lipid membrane as a chemical reactor for controlled assembly for polymers because lipid membrane is easily destabilized by loading of extraneous molecules. We found that a several-nanometer-thick bilayer vesicle made by self-assembly of an organic fullerene amphiphile doped with a metathesis catalyst serves as a nanosized chemical reactor in water, where a polymer is synthesized and assembled, depending on the affinity of the growing polymer to the organic groups on the amphiphile. This catalyst\xe2\x80\x93bilayer system can thus control supramolecular assembly of the ester-functionalized polymer product into different nanoscale structures: a nanoparticle made of a single polymer chain and a nanocapsule made of several tens of polymer chains."
"The scope and mechanism of the microenvironment-catalyzed C(sp3)\xe2\x88\x92C(sp3) reductive elimination from transition metal complexes [Au(III), Pt(IV)] is explored. Experiments detailing the effect of structural perturbation of neutral and anionic spectator ligands, reactive alkyl ligands, solvent, and catalyst structure are disclosed. Indirect evidence for a coordinatively unsaturated encapsulated cationic intermediate is garnered via observation of several inactive donor-arrested inclusion complexes, including a crystallographically characterized encapsulated Au(III) cation. Finally, based on stoichiometric experiments under catalytically relevant conditions, a detailed mechanism is outlined for the dual supramolecular and platinum-catalyzed C\xe2\x80\x93C coupling between methyl iodide and tetramethyltin. Determination of major platinum species present under catalytic conditions and subsequent investigation of their chemistry reveals an unexpected interplay between cis\xe2\x80\x93trans isomerism and the supramolecular catalyst in a Pt(II)/Pt(IV) cycle, as well as several off-cycle reactions."
"Water of hydration plays an important role in minerals, determining their crystal structures and physical properties. Here ultrafast nonlinear infrared (IR) techniques, two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) and polarization selective pump\xe2\x80\x93probe (PSPP) spectroscopies, were used to measure the dynamics and disorder of water of hydration in two minerals, gypsum (CaSO4\xc2\xb72H2O) and bassanite (CaSO4\xc2\xb70.5H2O). 2D IR spectra revealed that water arrangement in freshly precipitated gypsum contained a small amount of inhomogeneity. Following annealing at 348 K, water molecules became highly ordered; the 2D IR spectrum became homogeneously broadened (motional narrowed). PSPP measurements observed only inertial orientational relaxation. In contrast, water in bassanite\xe2\x80\x99s tubular channels is dynamically disordered. 2D IR spectra showed a significant amount of inhomogeneous broadening caused by a range of water configurations. At 298 K, water dynamics cause spectral diffusion that sampled a portion of the inhomogeneous line width on the time scale of \xe2\x88\xbc30 ps, while the rest of inhomogeneity is static on the time scale of the measurements. At higher temperature, the dynamics become faster. Spectral diffusion accelerates, and a portion of the lower temperature spectral diffusion became motionally narrowed. At sufficiently high temperature, all of the dynamics that produced spectral diffusion at lower temperatures became motionally narrowed, and only homogeneous broadening and static inhomogeneity were observed. Water angular motions in bassanite exhibit temperature-dependent diffusive orientational relaxation in a restricted cone of angles. The experiments were made possible by eliminating the vast amount of scattered light produced by the granulated powder samples using phase cycling methods."
"Complexes [PhBP3]RuH(\xce\xb73-H2SiRR\xe2\x80\xb2) (RR\xe2\x80\xb2 = Me,Ph, 1a; RR\xe2\x80\xb2 = Ph2, 1b; RR\xe2\x80\xb2 = Et2, 1c) react with XylNC to form carbene complexes [PhBP3]Ru(H)\xe2\x95\x90[C(H)(N(Xyl)(\xce\xb72-H\xe2\x80\x93SiRR\xe2\x80\xb2))] (2a\xe2\x80\x93c; previously reported for 2a,b). Reactions of 1a\xe2\x80\x93c with XylNC were further investigated to assess how metal complexes with multiple M\xe2\x80\x93H\xe2\x80\x93Si bonds can mediate transformations of unsaturated substrates. Complex 2a eliminates an N-methylsilacycloindoline product (3a) that results from hydrosilylation, hydrogenation, and benzylic C\xe2\x80\x93H activation of XylNC. Turnover was achieved in a pseudocatalytic manner by careful control of the reaction conditions. Complex 1c mediates a catalytic isocyanide reductive coupling to furnish an alkene product (4) in a transformation that has precedent only in stoichiometric processes. The formations of 3a and 4 were investigated with deuterium labeling experiments, KIE and other kinetic studies, and by examining the reactivity of XylNC with an \xce\xb73-H2SiMeMes complex (1d) to form a C\xe2\x80\x93H activated complex (6). Complex 6 serves as a model for an intermediate in the formation of 3a, and NMR investigations at \xe2\x88\x9230 \xc2\xb0C reveal that 6 forms via a carbene complex (1d) that isomerizes to aminomethyl complex 7d. These investigations reveal that the formations of 3a and 4 involve multiple 4-, 5-, and 6-coordinate silicon species with 0, 1, 2, or 3 Ru\xe2\x80\x93H\xe2\x80\x93Si bonds. These mechanisms demonstrate exceptionally intricate roles for silicon in transition-metal-catalyzed reactions with a silane reagent."
"Copper-catalyzed directed decarboxylative amination of nonactivated aliphatic carboxylic acids is described. This intramolecular C\xe2\x80\x93N bond formation reaction provides efficient access to the synthesis of pyrrolidine and piperidine derivatives as well as the modification of complex natural products. Moreover, this reaction presents excellent site-selectivity in the C\xe2\x80\x93N bond formation step through the use of directing group. Our work can be considered as a big step toward controllable radical decarboxylative carbon\xe2\x80\x93heteroatom cross-coupling."
"Square-planar alkylidyne and five-coordinate alkylidene mixed iPr3P\xe2\x80\x93Os\xe2\x80\x93IPr (IPr = 1,3-bis(diisopropylphenyl)imidazolylidene) complexes have been discovered and characterized, and their formation has been rationalized. The cationic five-coordinate hydride-alkylidyne compounds [OsHX(\xe2\x89\xa1CPh)(IPr)(PiPr3)]OTf (X = Cl (1), F (4); OTf = CF3SO3) undergo deprotonation with KOtBu to afford the trans-halide-alkylidyne square-planar derivatives OsX(\xe2\x89\xa1CPh)(IPr)(PiPr3) (X = Cl (2), F (5)). Oxidative addition of the C(sp)\xe2\x80\x93H bond of phenylacetylene and methyl propiolate along the Cl\xe2\x80\x93Os\xe2\x80\x93CPh axis of 2 with the hydrogen atom directed to the alkylidyne leads to alkynyl-cis-hydride-alkylidyne intermediates, which rapidly evolve into the five-coordinate alkylidene complexes Os(C\xe2\x89\xa1CR)Cl(\xe2\x95\x90CHPh)(IPr)(PiPr3) (R = Ph (6), CO2Me (7)) as a consequence of the migration of the hydride from the metal center to the C\xce\xb1 atom of the alkylidyne. Oxidative addition of the C(sp)\xe2\x80\x93H bond of methyl propiolate along the X\xe2\x80\x93Os\xe2\x80\x93CPh axis of 2 and 5 with the hydrogen atom directed to the halide gives the alkynyl-trans-hydride-alkylidyne derivatives OsH(C\xe2\x89\xa1CCO2Me)X(\xe2\x89\xa1CPh)(IPr)(PiPr3) (X = Cl (8), F (9)). Complex 8 evolves into 7. However, complex 9 containing the stronger \xcf\x80-donor fluoride is stable. The oxidative addition of HCl to 2 selectively yields the cis-hydride-alkylidyne compound OsHCl2(\xe2\x89\xa1CPh)(IPr)(PiPr3) (10), which is also stable."
Experiments and computational studies show the effects of electron-withdrawing or -donating substituents on halogen bonding to pyridine rings.
"The traditional structure\xe2\x80\x93function paradigm has provided significant insights for well-folded proteins in which structures can be easily and rapidly revealed by X-ray crystallography beamlines. However, approximately one-third of the human proteome is comprised of intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDPs/IDRs) that do not adopt a dominant well-folded structure, and therefore remain \xe2\x80\x9cunseen\xe2\x80\x9d by traditional structural biology methods. This Perspective considers the challenges raised by the \xe2\x80\x9cDark Proteome\xe2\x80\x9d, in which determining the diverse conformational substates of IDPs in their free states, in encounter complexes of bound states, and in complexes retaining significant disorder requires an unprecedented level of integration of multiple and complementary solution-based experiments that are analyzed with state-of-the art molecular simulation, Bayesian probabilistic models, and high-throughput computation. We envision how these diverse experimental and computational tools can work together through formation of a \xe2\x80\x9ccomputational beamline\xe2\x80\x9d that will allow key functional features to be identified in IDP structural ensembles."
"Circularly polarized (CP) light is of interest in areas such as quantum optical computing, optical spintronics, biomedicine, and high efficiency displays. Direct emission of CP light from organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has been a focus of research as it has the immediate application of increasing efficiency and simplifying device architecture in OLED based displays. High dissymmetry (gEL) factor values have been reported for devices employing fluorescent polymers, but these CP-OLEDs are limited in their ultimate efficiencies by the type of emissive electronic transitions involved. In contrast, phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs) can emit light from triplet excited states and can therefore achieve very high efficiencies. However, CP-PHOLEDs are significantly understudied, and the two previous reports suffered from very low brightness or gEL values. Here, we use a platinahelicene complex to construct a CP-PHOLED that achieves both a display level brightness and a high gEL factor. The dissymmetry of CP emission reached with this proof-of-concept single-layer helicene-based device is sufficient to provide real-world benefits over nonpolarized emission and paves the way toward chiral metal complex-based CP-PHOLED displays."
"We report a 129Xe NMR relaxation-based sensing approach that exploits changes in the bulk xenon relaxation rate induced by slowed tumbling of a cryptophane-based sensor upon target binding. The amplification afforded by detection of the bulk dissolved xenon allows sensitive detection of targets. The sensor comprises a xenon-binding cryptophane cage, a target interaction element, and a metal chelating agent. Xenon associated with the target-bound cryptophane cage is rapidly relaxed and then detected after exchange with the bulk. Here we show that large macromolecular targets increase the rotational correlation time of xenon, increasing its relaxation rate. Upon binding of a biotin-containing sensor to avidin at 1.5 \xce\xbcM concentration, the free xenon T2 is reduced by a factor of 4."
"One of the most ubiquitous stabilizing forces in nature is the hydrogen bond, exemplified by the folded secondary, tertiary, and higher-order structure of biomolecules. Despite the fundamental importance of hydrogen bonding, dependence on this stabilizing force places limitations on nature\xe2\x80\x99s proteinogenic building blocks. Herein, we demonstrate that replacement of the strictly conserved glycine in collagen with aza-glycine has profound consequences on the stability and self-assembly of collagen peptides by providing an extra hydrogen bond donor. The additional hydrogen bond provided by aza-glycine allows for complete replacement of glycine residues in collagen peptides and truncation to the smallest self-assembling collagen peptide systems observed to date. Our results highlight the vital importance of hydrogen bonding at desolvated interfaces, providing a new strategy for optimization of designed peptide materials and a general solution for stabilizing the collagen triple helix."
"Pyrococcus horikoshii Dph2 (PhDph2) is an unusual radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme involved in the first step of diphthamide biosynthesis. It catalyzes the reaction by cleaving SAM to generate a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) radical. To probe the reaction mechanism, we synthesized a SAM analogue (SAMCA), in which the ACP group of SAM is replaced with a 3-carboxyallyl group. SAMCA is cleaved by PhDph2, yielding a paramagnetic (S = 1/2) species, which is assigned to a complex formed between the reaction product, \xce\xb1-sulfinyl-3-butenoic acid, and the [4Fe-4S] cluster. Electron\xe2\x80\x93nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) measurements with 13C and 2H isotopically labeled SAMCA support a \xcf\x80-complex between the C\xe2\x95\x90C double bond of \xce\xb1-sulfinyl-3-butenoic acid and the unique iron of the [4Fe-4S] cluster. This is the first example of a radical SAM-related [4Fe-4S]+ cluster forming an organometallic complex with an alkene, shedding additional light on the mechanism of PhDph2 and expanding our current notions for the reactivity of [4Fe-4S] clusters in radical SAM enzymes."
Molecular imprinting within cross-linked micelles using 4-vinylphenylboronate derivatives of carbohydrates provided water-soluble nanoparticle receptors selective for the carbohydrate templates. Complete differentiation of d-aldohexoses could be achieved by these receptors if a single inversion of hydroxyl occurred at C2 or C4 of the sugar or if two or more inversions took place. Glycosides with a hydrophobic aglycan displayed stronger binding due to increased hydrophobic interactions.
A cascade cyanation/diborylation of terminal allenes proceeds efficiently with copper catalysis using bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2Pin2) and N-cyano-N-phenyl-p-methylbenzenesulfonamide (NCTS) as reagents. Mechanistic studies suggest that the process proceeds through cyanoborylation of the substituted \xcf\x80-system of the allene followed by hydroboration of the remaining \xcf\x80-component. A wide array of product derivatives may be accessed through site-selective cross-couplings and N-bromosuccinimide-promoted heteroarylations as well as standard oxidative and reductive conversions of the initially obtained adducts.
"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) usually crystallize as insoluble powders, and their processing for suitable devices is thought to be limited. We demonstrate that COFs can be mechanically pressed into shaped objects having anisotropic ordering with preferred orientation between hk0 and 00l crystallographic planes. Five COFs with different functionality and symmetry exhibited similar crystallographic behavior and remarkable stability, indicating the generality of this processing. Pellets prepared from bulk COF powders impregnated with LiClO4 displayed room temperature conductivity up to 0.26 mS cm\xe2\x80\x931 and high electrochemical stability. This outcome portends use of COFs as solid-state electrolytes in batteries."
"Semiconductor quantum rings are of great fundamental interest because their non-trivial topology creates novel physical properties. At the same time, toroidal topology is difficult to achieve for colloidal nanocrystals and epitaxially grown semiconductor nanostructures. In this work, we introduce the synthesis of luminescent colloidal CdSe nanorings and nanostructures with double and triple toroidal topology. The nanorings form during controlled etching and rearrangement of two-dimensional nanoplatelets. We discuss a possible mechanism of the transformation of nanoplatelets into nanorings and potential utility of colloidal nanorings for magneto-optical (e.g., Aharonov\xe2\x80\x93Bohm effect) and other applications."
"Herein is reported the direct asymmetric addition of phenol nucleophiles to benzopyrylium salts as a means to produce enantioenriched flavonoid-like compounds. This enantioselective C\xe2\x80\x93C bond construction was achieved through a chiral anion phase-transfer strategy that mimics the proposed biosynthesis of this structurally diverse set of natural products. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated in enantioselective synthesis of a 2,8-dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane and a 2,4-diarylbenzopyran."
"The hemispherand-strapped calix[4]pyrrole (1) acts as an ion pair receptor that exhibits selectivity for lithium salts. In organic media (CD2Cl2 and CD3OD, v/v, 9:1), receptor 1 binds LiCl with high preference relative to NaCl, KCl, and RbCl. DFT calculations provided support for the observed selectivity. Single crystal structures of five different lithium ion-pair complexes of 1 were obtained. In the case of LiCl, a single bridging water molecule between the lithium cation and chloride anion was observed, while tight contact ion pairs were observed in the case of the LiBr, LiI, LiNO3, and LiNO2 salts. Receptor 1 proved effective as an extractant for LiNO2 under both model solid\xe2\x80\x93liquid and liquid\xe2\x80\x93liquid extraction conditions."
"Mono(phosphine)\xe2\x80\x93M (M\xe2\x80\x93PR3; M = Rh and Ir) complexes selectively prepared by postsynthetic metalation of a porous triarylphosphine-based metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework (MOF) exhibited excellent activity in the hydrosilylation of ketones and alkenes, the hydrogenation of alkenes, and the C\xe2\x80\x93H borylation of arenes. The recyclable and reusable MOF catalysts significantly outperformed their homogeneous counterparts, presumably via stabilizing M\xe2\x80\x93PR3 intermediates by preventing deleterious disproportionation reactions/ligand exchanges in the catalytic cycles."
"The copper-catalyzed intermolecular enantioselective addition of styrenes to imines has been achieved under mild conditions at ambient temperature. This process features the use of styrenes as latent carbanion equivalents via the intermediacy of catalytically generated benzylcopper derivatives, providing an effective means for accessing highly enantiomerically enriched amines bearing contiguous stereocenters. Mechanistic studies shed light on the origin of the preferential styrene hydrocupration in the presence of an imine with the Ph-BPE-derived copper catalyst."
"Herein we demonstrate that chabazite zeolite SAPO-34 membranes effectively separated Kr/Xe gas mixtures at industrially relevant compositions. Control over membrane thickness and average crystal size led to industrial range permeances and high separation selectivities. Specifically, SAPO-34 membranes can separate Kr/Xe mixtures with Kr permeances as high as 1.2 \xc3\x97 10 \xe2\x80\x937 mol/m2 s Pa and separation selectivities of 35 for molar compositions close to typical concentrations of these two gases in air. In addition, SAPO-34 membranes separated Kr/Xe mixtures with Kr permeances as high as 1.2 \xc3\x97 10 \xe2\x80\x937 mol/m2 s Pa and separation selectivities up to 45 for molar compositions as might be encountered in nuclear reprocessing technologies. Molecular sieving and differences in diffusivities were identified as the dominant separation mechanisms."
"We report the synthesis and characterization of the title anion which has a germanium/palladium cluster core of [Ge18Pd3] and six tri-isopropyl tin substituents. Its two Ge9-halves are the first examples of germanium deltahedra with three nonsilyl substituents, tri-isopropyl tin in this case. The new cluster is made by a reaction of an acetonitrile suspension of K4Ge9 with iPr3SnCl that generates primarily tristannylated 9-atom clusters [Ge9{SniPr3}3]\xe2\x88\x92, followed by addition of Pd(PPh3)4 to the reaction mixture. It was structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction in [K(222crypt)]2[Ge18Pd3{SniPr3}6]\xc2\xb7iPr2O and was also confirmed in solution by ESI-MS and NMR. The new anion can be viewed both as a dimer of face-fused icosahedra (twinned icosahedron) with a common Pd3-face, i.e., [(iPr3Sn)3Ge9Pd3Ge9(SniPr3)3]2\xe2\x80\x93 that resembles but is not isoelectronic with the known borane version B21H18\xe2\x80\x93 or as a large hypho-deltahedron of 18 Ge-atoms with a triangle of Pd3 inside, i.e., [Pd3@Ge18(SniPr3)6]2\xe2\x80\x93. DFT calculations show a very large HOMO\xe2\x80\x93LUMO gap of 2.42 eV."
"While reaction of carbene-stabilized disilicon L:Si\xe2\x95\x90Si:L (L: = C{N(2,6-iPr2C6H3)CH}2) (8) with HCl\xc2\xb7NC5H5 results in carbene-stabilized Si2Cl2 (2) and substituted 1H-imidazole (9), combination of the corresponding Fe(CO)4-modified disilicon carbene complex L:Si\xe2\x95\x90Si[Fe(CO)4]:L (6) with pyridine hydrochloride gives a species containing two push\xe2\x80\x93pull-stabilized parent monochlorosilylenes that are bridged by an Fe(CO)3 unit (7). The nature of 7 was further elucidated by spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational methods. Spectroscopic data suggest that 7 exists as two diastereoisomers."
"The first enantioselective total synthesis of the cytotoxic natural product (+)-psiguadial B is reported. Key features of the synthesis include (1) the enantioselective preparation of a key cyclobutane intermediate by a tandem Wolff rearrangement/asymmetric ketene addition, (2) a directed C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H alkenylation reaction to strategically forge the C1\xe2\x80\x93C2 bond, and (3) a ring-closing metathesis to build the bridging bicyclo[4.3.1]decane terpene framework."
"While rotary molecular switches based on neutral and cationic organic \xcf\x80-systems have been reported, structurally homologous anionic switches providing complementary properties have not been prepared so far. Here we report the design and preparation of a molecular switch mimicking the anionic p-HBDI chromophore of the green fluorescent protein. The investigation of the mechanism and dynamics of the E/Z switching function is carried out both computationally and experimentally. The data consistently support axial rotary motion occurring on a sub-picosecond time scale. Transient spectroscopy and trajectory simulations show that the nonadiabatic decay process occurs in the vicinity of a conical intersection (CInt) between a charge transfer state and a covalent/diradical state. Comparison of our anionic p-HBDI-like switch with the previously reported cationic N-alkyl indanylidene pyrrolinium switch mimicking visual pigments reveals that these similar systems translocate, upon vertical excitation, a similar net charge in the same axial direction."
"Chaperones maintain a healthy proteome by preventing aggregation and by aiding in protein folding. Precisely how chaperones influence the conformational properties of their substrates, however, remains unclear. To achieve a detailed description of dynamic chaperone\xe2\x80\x93substrate interactions, we fused site-specific NMR information with coarse-grained simulations. Our model system is the binding and folding of a chaperone substrate, immunity protein 7 (Im7), with the chaperone Spy. We first used an automated procedure in which NMR chemical shifts inform the construction of system-specific force fields that describe each partner individually. The models of the two binding partners are then combined to perform simulations on the chaperone\xe2\x80\x93substrate complex. The binding simulations show excellent agreement with experimental data from multiple biophysical measurements. Upon binding, Im7 interacts with a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues on Spy\xe2\x80\x99s surface, causing conformational exchange within Im7 to slow down as Im7 folds. Meanwhile, the motion of Spy\xe2\x80\x99s flexible loop region increases, allowing for better interaction with different substrate conformations, and helping offset losses in Im7 conformational dynamics that occur upon binding and folding. Spy then preferentially releases Im7 into a well-folded state. Our strategy has enabled a residue-level description of a dynamic chaperone\xe2\x80\x93substrate interaction, improving our understanding of how chaperones facilitate substrate folding. More broadly, we validate our approach using two other binding partners, showing that this approach provides a general platform from which to investigate other flexible biomolecular complexes through the integration of NMR data with efficient computational models."
"The amyloid-\xce\xb2 (A\xce\xb2) peptide of Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease (AD) forms polymorphic fibrils on the micrometer and molecular scales. Various fibril growth conditions have been identified to cause polymorphism, but the intrinsic amino acid sequence basis for this polymorphism has been unclear. Several single-site mutations in the center of the A\xce\xb2 sequence cause different disease phenotypes and fibrillization properties. The E22G (Arctic) mutant is found in familial AD and forms protofibrils more rapidly than wild-type A\xce\xb2. Here, we use solid-state NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structure, dynamics, hydration and morphology of Arctic E22G A\xce\xb240 fibrils. 13C, 15N-labeled synthetic E22G A\xce\xb240 peptides are studied and compared with wild-type and Osaka E22\xce\x94 A\xce\xb240 fibrils. Under the same fibrillization conditions, Arctic A\xce\xb240 exhibits a high degree of polymorphism, showing at least four sets of NMR chemical shifts for various residues, while the Osaka and wild-type A\xce\xb240 fibrils show a single or a predominant set of chemical shifts. Thus, structural polymorphism is intrinsic to the Arctic E22G A\xce\xb240 sequence. Chemical shifts and inter-residue contacts obtained from 2D correlation spectra indicate that one of the major Arctic conformers has surprisingly high structural similarity with wild-type A\xce\xb242. 13C\xe2\x80\x931H dipolar order parameters, 1H rotating-frame spin\xe2\x80\x93lattice relaxation times and water-to-protein spin diffusion experiments reveal substantial differences in the dynamics and hydration of Arctic, Osaka and wild-type A\xce\xb240 fibrils. Together, these results strongly suggest that electrostatic interactions in the center of the A\xce\xb2 peptide sequence play a crucial role in the three-dimensional fold of the fibrils, and by inference, fibril-induced neuronal toxicity and AD pathogenesis."
"We have investigated the influence of electron density on the three-center [N\xe2\x80\x93I\xe2\x80\x93N]+ halogen bond. A series of [bis(pyridine)iodine]+ and [1,2-bis((pyridine-2-ylethynyl)benzene)iodine]+ BF4\xe2\x80\x93 complexes substituted with electron withdrawing and donating functionalities in the para-position of their pyridine nitrogen were synthesized and studied by spectroscopic and computational methods. The systematic change of electron density of the pyridine nitrogens upon alteration of the para-substituent (NO2, CF3, H, F, Me, OMe, NMe2) was confirmed by 15N NMR and by computation of the natural atomic population and the \xcf\x80 electron population of the nitrogen atoms. Formation of the [N\xe2\x80\x93I\xe2\x80\x93N]+ halogen bond resulted in >100 ppm 15N NMR coordination shifts. Substituent effects on the 15N NMR chemical shift are governed by the \xcf\x80 population rather than the total electron population at the nitrogens. Isotopic perturbation of equilibrium NMR studies along with computation on the DFT level indicate that all studied systems possess static, symmetric [N\xe2\x80\x93I\xe2\x80\x93N]+ halogen bonds, independent of their electron density. This was further confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction data of 4-substituted [bis(pyridine)iodine]+ complexes. An increased electron density of the halogen bond acceptor stabilizes the [N\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7I\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N]+ bond, whereas electron deficiency reduces the stability of the complexes, as demonstrated by UV-kinetics and computation. In contrast, the N\xe2\x80\x93I bond length is virtually unaffected by changes of the electron density. The understanding of electronic effects on the [N\xe2\x80\x93X\xe2\x80\x93N]+ halogen bond is expected to provide a useful handle for the modulation of the reactivity of [bis(pyridine)halogen]+-type synthetic reagents."
"Catalysis with remote-stereocontrol provides special challenges in design and comprehension. One famous example is the dienamine catalysis, for which high ee values are reported despite insufficient shielding of the second double bond. Especially for dienamines with variable Z/E-ratios of the second double bond, no correlations to the ee values are found. Therefore, the structures, thermodynamics, and kinetics of dienamine intermediates in SN-type reactions are investigated. The NMR studies show that the preferred dienamine conformation provides an effective shielding if large electrophiles are used. Calculations at SCS-MP2/CBS-level of theory and experimental data of the dienamine formation show kinetic preference for the Z-isomer of the second double bond and a slow isomerization toward the thermodynamically preferred E-isomer. Modulations of the rate-determining step, by variation of the concentration of the electrophile, allow the conversion of dienamines to be observed. With electrophiles, a faster reaction of Z- than of E-isomers is observed experimentally. Calculations corroborate these results by correlating ee values of three catalysts with the kinetics of the electrophilic attack and reveal the significance of CH\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 and stacking interactions in the transition states. Thus, for the first time a comprehensive understanding of the remote stereocontrol in \xce\xb3-functionalization reactions of dienamines and an explanation to the \xe2\x80\x9cZ/E-dilemma\xe2\x80\x9d are presented. The combination of bulky catalyst subsystems and large electrophiles provides a shielding of one face and causes different reactivities of E/Z-dienamines in nucleophilic attacks from the other face. Kinetic preferences for the formation of Z-dienamines and their unfavorable thermodynamics support high ee values."
"Most mammalian tissues contain a single proteasome species: constitutive proteasomes. Tissues able to express, next to the constitutive proteasome catalytic activities (\xce\xb21c, \xce\xb22c, \xce\xb25c), the three homologous activities, \xce\xb21i, \xce\xb22i and \xce\xb25i, may contain numerous distinct proteasome particles: immunoproteasomes (composed of \xce\xb21i, \xce\xb22i and \xce\xb25i) and mixed proteasomes containing a mix of these activities. This work describes the development of new subunit-selective activity-based probes and their use in an activity-based protein profiling assay that allows the detection of various proteasome particles. Tissue extracts are treated with subunit-specific probes bearing distinct fluorophores and subunit-specific inhibitors. The samples are resolved by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, after which fluorescence-resonance energy transfer (FRET) reports on the nature of proteasomes present."
"Biodegradability of inorganic nanoparticles is one of the most critical issues in their further clinical translations. In this work, a novel \xe2\x80\x9cmetal ion-doping\xe2\x80\x9d approach has been developed to endow inorganic mesoporous silica-based nanoparticles with tumor-sensitive biodegradation and theranostic functions, simply by topological transformation of mesoporous silica to metal-doped composite nanoformulations. \xe2\x80\x9cManganese extraction\xe2\x80\x9d sensitive to tumor microenvironment was enabled in manganese-doped hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (designated as Mn-HMSNs) to fast promote the disintegration and biodegradation of Mn-HMSNs, further accelerating the breakage of Si\xe2\x80\x93O\xe2\x80\x93Si bonds within the framework. The fast biodegradation of Mn-HMSNs sensitive to mild acidic and reducing microenvironment of tumor resulted in much accelerated anticancer drug releasing and enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of tumor. A high tumor-inhibition effect was simultaneously achieved by anticancer drug delivery mediated by PEGylated Mn-HMSNs, and the high biocompatibility of composite nanosystems was systematically demonstrated in vivo. This is the first demonstration of biodegradable inorganic mesoporous nanosystems with specific biodegradation behavior sensitive to tumor microenvironment, which also provides a feasible approach to realize the on-demand biodegradation of inorganic nanomaterials simply by \xe2\x80\x9cmetal ion-doping\xe2\x80\x9d strategy, paving the way to solve the critical low-biodegradation issue of inorganic drug carriers."
"Within the broad interest of assembling chiral left- and right-handed helices of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs), we introduce the DNA-guided organization of left- or right-handed plasmonic Au NPs on DNA scaffolds. The method involves the self-assembly of stacked 12 DNA quasi-rings interlinked by 30 staple-strands. By the functionalization of one group of staple units with programmed tether-nucleic acid strands and additional staple elements with long nucleic acid chains, acting as promoter strands, the promoter-guided assembly of barrels modified with 12 left- or right-handed tethers is achieved. The subsequent hybridization of Au NPs functionalized with single nucleic acid tethers yields left- or right-handed structures of plasmonic NPs. The plasmonic NP structures reveal CD spectra at the plasmon absorbance, and the NPs are imaged by HR-TEM. Using geometrical considerations corresponding to the left- and right-handed helices of the Au NPs, the experimental CD spectra of the plasmonic Au NPs are modeled by theoretical calculations."
"Proton transfer reactions are ubiquitous in enzymes and utilize active site residues as general acids and bases. Crystal structures and site-directed mutagenesis are routinely used to identify these residues, but assessment of their catalytic contribution remains a major challenge. In principle, effective molarity measurements, in which exogenous acids/bases rescue the reaction in mutants lacking these residues, can estimate these catalytic contributions. However, these exogenous moieties can be restricted in reactivity by steric hindrance or enhanced by binding interactions with nearby residues, thereby resulting in over- or underestimation of the catalytic contribution, respectively. With these challenges in mind, we investigated the catalytic contribution of an aspartate general base in ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) by exogenous rescue. In addition to removing the general base, we systematically mutated nearby residues and probed each mutant with a series of carboxylate bases of similar pKa but varying size. Our results underscore the need for extensive and multifaceted variation to assess and minimize steric and positioning effects and determine effective molarities that estimate catalytic contributions. We obtained consensus effective molarities of \xe2\x88\xbc5 \xc3\x97 104 M for KSI from Comamonas testosteroni (tKSI) and \xe2\x88\xbc103 M for KSI from Pseudomonas putida (pKSI). An X-ray crystal structure of a tKSI general base mutant showed no additional structural rearrangements, and double mutant cycles revealed similar contributions from an oxyanion hole mutation in the wild-type and base-rescued reactions, providing no indication of mutational effects extending beyond the general base site. Thus, the high effective molarities suggest a large catalytic contribution associated with the general base. A significant portion of this effect presumably arises from positioning of the base, but its large magnitude suggests the involvement of additional catalytic mechanisms as well."
"We report the direct isolation of user-defined DNA sequences from the human genome with programmable selectivity for both canonical and epigenetic nucleobases. This is enabled by the use of engineered transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) as DNA major groove-binding probes in affinity enrichment. The approach provides the direct quantification of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) levels at single genomic nucleotide positions in a strand-specific manner. We demonstrate the simple, multiplexed typing of a variety of epigenetic cancer biomarker 5mC with custom TALE mixes. Compared to antibodies as the most widely used affinity probes for 5mC analysis, i.e., employed in the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) protocol, TALEs provide superior sensitivity, resolution and technical ease. We engineer a range of size-reduced TALE repeats and establish full selectivity profiles for their binding to all five human cytosine nucleobases. These provide insights into their nucleobase recognition mechanisms and reveal the ability of TALEs to isolate genomic target sequences with selectivity for single 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and, in combination with sodium borohydride reduction, single 5-formylcytosine nucleobases."
"During the past two years, the introduction of DMSO has revolutionized the fabrication of high-quality pervoskite MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) films for solar cell applications. In the developed DMSO process, the formation of (MA)2Pb3I8\xc2\xb72DMSO (shorted as Pb3I8) has well recognized as a critical factor to prepare high-quality pervoskite films and thus accomplish excellent performances in perovskite solar cells. However, Pb3I8 is an I-deficient intermediate and must further react with methylammonium iodide (MAI) to be fully converted into MAPbI3. By capturing and solving the molecular structures of several intermediates involved in the fabrication of perovskite films, we report in this work that the importance of DMSO is NOT due to the formation of Pb3I8. The use of different PbI2-DMSO ratios leads to two different structures of PbI2-DMSO precursors (PbI2\xc2\xb7DMSO and PbI2\xc2\xb72DMSO), thus dramatically influencing the quality of fabricated perovskite films. However, such an influence can be minimized when the PbI2-DMSO precursor films are thermally treated to create mesoporous PbI2 films before reacting with MAI. Such a development makes the fabrication of high-quality pervoskite films highly reproducible without the need to precisely control the PbI2:DMSO ratio. Moreover, the formation of ionic compound (MA)4PbI6 is observed when excess MAI is used in the preparation of perovskite film. This I-rich phase heavily induces the hysteresis in PSCs, but is readily removed by isopropanol treatment. On the basis of all these findings, we develop a new effective protocol to fabricate high-performance PSCs. In the new protocol, high-quality perovskite films are prepared by simply treating the mesoporous PbI2 films (made from PbI2-DMSO precursors) with an isopropanol solution of MAI, followed by isopropanol washing. The best efficiency of fabricated MAPbI3 PSCs is up to 19.0%. As compared to the previously reported DMSO method, the devices fabricated by the method reported in this work display narrow efficiency distributions in both forward and reverse scans. And the efficiency difference between forward and reverse scans is much smaller."
"A novel superconductor, LaPt5As, which exhibits a new crystal structure was discovered by high-pressure synthesis using a Kawai-type apparatus. A superconducting transition temperature was observed at 2.6 K. Depending on the sintering pressure, LaPt5As has superconducting and non-superconducting phases with different crystal structures. A sintering pressure of around 10 GPa is effective to form single-phase superconducting LaPt5As. This material has a very unique crystal structure with an extremely long c lattice parameter of over 60 \xc3\x85 and corner-sharing tetrahedrons composed of network-like Pt layers. Density functional theory calculations have suggested that the superconducting current flows through these Pt layers. Also, this unique layered structure characteristic of LaPt5As is thought to play a key role in the emergence of superconductivity. Furthermore, due to a stacking structure which makes up layers, various structural modifications for the LaPt5As family are conceivable. Since such a high-pressure synthesis using a Kawai-type apparatus is not common in the field of materials science, there is large room for further exploration of unknown phases which are induced by high pressure in various materials."
"Most asymmetric phase transfer reactions are Br\xc3\xb8nsted base reactions, and the inorganic bases used greatly influenced the profile of the reaction. Alkoxide salts are able to activate substrates with high pKa values, but background reactions are often unavoidable. On the other hand, carbonate and phosphate salts are milder, but their low basicity limits the scope of their reactions. This presents a difficult situation whereby fragile substrates such as lactone will be hydrolyzed by a stronger base but will not be activated with a weaker one. Thus, a Br\xc3\xb8nsted probase strategy is devised, in which a strong base can be generated in situ from silylamide (probase) through the use of fluoride. In this approach, the strong base produced will be transient and not be in excess, thus reducing background and side reactions. We demonstrate this strategy using pentanidinium and bisguanidinium as catalysts; highly enantioselective phase transfer alkylation of several types of substrates including dihydrocoumarin (lactone) can be achieved. We found that the probase also acts as a silylation reagent, generating silyl enol ether or silyl ketene acetal, which are key intermediates in the reaction. We further propose that hypervalent silicates form ion-pairs with pentanidinium and bisguanidinium as intermediates in the reaction, and it is through these ion-pairs that the selective enantiofacial approach of the electrophile is determined."
"The use of carbon dioxide for synthetic applications presents a major goal in modern homogeneous catalysis. Rhodium\xe2\x80\x93hydride PNP pincer complex 1 is shown to add CO2 in two disparate pathways: one is the expected insertion of CO2 into the metal\xe2\x80\x93hydride bond, and the other leads to reductive cleavage of CO2, involving metal\xe2\x80\x93ligand cooperation. The resultant rhodium\xe2\x80\x93carbonyl complex was found to be photoactive, enabling the activation of benzene and formation of a new benzoyl complex. Organometallic intermediate species were observed and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Based on the series of individual transformations, a sequence for the photocarbonylation of benzene using CO2 as the feedstock was constructed and demonstrated for the production of benzaldehyde from benzene."
"DNA bending is critical for DNA packaging, recognition, and repair, and occurs toward either the major or the minor groove. The anisotropy of B-DNA groove bending was quantified for eight DNA sequences by free energy simulations employing a novel reaction coordinate. The simulations show that bending toward the major groove is preferred for non-A-tracts while the A-tract has a high tendency of bending toward the minor groove. Persistence lengths were generally larger for bending toward the minor groove, which is thought to originate from differences in groove hydration. While this difference in stiffness is one of the factors determining the overall preference of bending direction, the dominant contribution is shown to be a free energy offset between major and minor groove bending. The data suggests that, for the A-tract, this offset is largely determined by inherent structural properties, while differences in groove hydration play a large role for non-A-tracts. By quantifying the energetics of DNA groove bending and rationalizing the origins of the anisotropy, the calculations provide important new insights into a key biological process."
"In the search for the two-electron-reduced intermediate of the tetraaza catalyst [CoIIN4H(MeCN)]2+ (N4H = 2,12-dimethyl-3,7,11,17-tetraazabicyclo[11.3.1]heptadeca-1(17),2,11,13,15-pentaene) for CO2 reduction and elementary steps that result in the formation of CO product, rapid-scan FT-IR spectroscopy of the visible-light-sensitized catalysis, using Ir(ppy)3 in wet acetonitrile (CD3CN) solution, led to the observation of two sequential intermediates. The initially formed one-electron-reduced [CoIN4H]+\xe2\x80\x93CO2 adduct was converted by the second electron to a transient [CoIN4H]+\xe2\x80\x93CO2\xe2\x80\x93 complex that spontaneously converted CO2 to CO in a rate-limiting step on the second time scale in the dark under regeneration of the catalyst (room temperature). The macrocycle IR spectra of the [CoIN4H]+\xe2\x80\x93CO2\xe2\x80\x93 complex and the preceding one-electron [CoIN4H]+\xe2\x80\x93CO2 intermediate show close similarity but distinct differences in the carboxylate modes, indicating that the second electron resides mainly on the CO2 ligand. Vibrational assignments are corroborated by 13C isotopic labeling. The structure and stability of the two-electron-reduced intermediate derived from the time-resolved IR study are in good agreement with recent predictions by DFT electronic structure calculations. This is the first observation of an intermediate of a molecular catalyst for CO2 reduction during the bond-breaking step producing CO. The reaction pathway for the Co tetraaza catalyst uncovered here suggests that the competition between CO2 reduction and proton reduction of a macrocyclic multi-electron catalyst is steered toward CO2 activation if the second electron is directly captured by an adduct of CO2 and the one-electron-reduced catalyst intermediate."
"The copper(I) triphosphine complex LCu(MeCN)PF6 (L = 1,1,1-tris(diphenylphosphinomethyl)ethane), which we recently demonstrated is an active catalyst precursor for hydrogenation of CO2 to formate, reacts with H2 in the presence of a base to form a cationic dicopper hydride, [(LCu)2H]PF6. [(LCu)2H]+ is also an active precursor for catalytic CO2 hydrogenation, with equivalent activity to that of LCu(MeCN)+, and therefore may be a relevant catalytic intermediate. The thermodynamic hydricity of [(LCu)2H]+ was determined to be 41.0 kcal/mol by measuring the equilibrium constant for this reaction using three different bases. [(LCu)2H]+ and the previously reported dimer (LCuH)2 can be synthesized by the reaction of LCu(MeCN)+ with 0.5 and 1 equiv of KB(OiPr)3H, respectively. The solid-state structure of [(LCu)2H]+ shows threefold symmetry about a linear Cu\xe2\x80\x93H\xe2\x80\x93Cu axis and significant steric strain imposed by bringing two LCu+ units together around the small hydride ligand. [(LCu)2H]+ reacts stoichiometrically with CO2 to generate the formate complex LCuO2CH and the solvento complex LCu(MeCN)+. The rate of the stoichiometric reaction between [(LCu)2H]+ and CO2 is dramatically increased in the presence of bases that coordinate strongly to the copper center, e.g. DBU and TMG. In the absence of CO2, the addition of a large excess of DBU to [(LCu)2H]+ results in an equilibrium that forms LCu(DBU)+ and also presumably the mononuclear hydride LCuH, which is not directly observed. Due to the significantly enhanced CO2 reactivity of [(LCu)2H]+ under these catalytically relevant conditions, LCuH is proposed to be the catalytically active metal hydride."
"A number of important reactions such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are catalyzed by transition metal oxides (TMOs), the surface reactivity of which is rather elusive. Therefore, rationally tailoring adsorption energy of intermediates on TMOs to achieve desirable catalytic performance still remains a great challenge. Here we show the identification of a general and tunable surface structure, coordinatively unsaturated metal cation (MCUS), as a good surface reactivity descriptor for TMOs in OER. Surface reactivity of a given TMO increases monotonically with the density of MCUS, and thus the increase in MCUS improves the catalytic activity for weak-binding TMOs but impairs that for strong-binding ones. The electronic origin of the surface reactivity can be well explained by a new model proposed in this work, wherein the energy of the highest-occupied d-states relative to the Fermi level determines the intermediates\xe2\x80\x99 bonding strength by affecting the filling of the antibonding states. Our model for the first time well describes the reactivity trends among TMOs, and would initiate viable design principles for, but not limited to, OER catalysts."
"Histamine chelation of copper(I) by a terminal histidine residue in copper hydroxylating enzymes activates dioxygen to form unknown oxidants, generally assumed as copper(II) species. The direct formation of copper(III)-containing products from the oxygenation of histamine-ligated copper(I) complexes is demonstrated here, indicating that copper(III) is a viable oxidation state in such products from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. At low temperatures, both trinuclear Cu(II)2Cu(III)O2 and dinuclear Cu(III)2O2 predominate, with the distribution dependent on the histamine ligand structure and oxygenation conditions. Kinetics studies suggest the bifurcation point to these two products is an unobserved peroxide-level dimer intermediate. The hydrogen atom reactivity difference between the trinuclear and binuclear complexes at parity of histamine ligand is striking. This behavior is best attributed to the accessibility of the bridging oxide ligands to exogenous substrates rather than a difference in oxidizing abilities of the clusters."
"Lipid rafts are widely believed to be an essential organizational motif in cell membranes. However, direct evidence for interactions among lipid and/or protein components believed to be associated with rafts is quite limited owing, in part, to the small size and intrinsically dynamic interactions that lead to raft formation. Here, we exploit the single negative charge on the monosialoganglioside GM1, commonly associated with rafts, to create a gradient of GM1 in response to an electric field applied parallel to a patterned supported lipid bilayer. The composition of this gradient is visualized by imaging mass spectrometry using a NanoSIMS. Using this analytical method, added cholesterol and sphingomyelin, both neutral and not themselves displaced by the electric field, are observed to reorganize with GM1. This dynamic reorganization provides direct evidence for an attractive interaction among these raft components into some sort of cluster. At steady state we obtain an estimate for the composition of this cluster."
"We demonstrate facile and efficient construction of conjugated double helical ladder oligomers from the saddle-shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh) building blocks. The key step involves deprotonation of tetra[3,4]thienylene (\xce\xb2,\xce\xb2-COTh) with n-BuLi which displays remarkably high ipsilateral selectivity. Three racemic double helical ladder oligomers, rac-DH-1, rac-DH-2, and rac-DH-3, containing two, three, and five COTh annelated moieties are efficiently synthesized by diastereoselective coupling of the racemic precursors. The X-ray crystallographic studies of rac-DH-1, rac-DH-2 and rac-DH-3 unambiguously revealed that each double helical scaffold has two single helices intertwined with each other via the C\xe2\x80\x93C single bonds. Following removal of TMS groups, double helical ladder oligomer rac-DH-1-D had sufficient solubility to be resolved via chiral HPLC, thus enabling determination of its chirooptical properties such as CD spectra and optical rotation. (+)-DH-1-D has a large barrier for racemization, with lower limit of \xce\x94G\xe2\x80\xa1 > 48 kcal mol\xe2\x80\x931, which may be compared to DFT-computed barrier of 51 kcal mol\xe2\x80\x931. The enantiomers of DH-1-D show 1 order of magnitude stronger chirooptical properties than the carbon\xe2\x80\x93sulfur [7]helicene, as determined by the anisotropy factor g = \xce\x94\xce\xb5/\xce\xb5 = \xe2\x88\x920.039, based on \xce\x94\xce\xb5max = \xe2\x88\x9211 and \xce\xb5 = 2.8 \xc3\x97 102 L mol\xe2\x80\x931 cm\xe2\x80\x931 in cyclohexane at 327 nm."
"Sesterterpenoids are a group of terpenoid natural products that are primarily biosynthesized via cyclization of the C25 linear substrate geranylfarnesyl pyrophosphate (GFPP). Although the long carbon chain of GFPP in theory allows for many different cyclization patterns, sesterterpenoids are relatively rare species among terpenoids, suggesting that many intriguing sesterterpenoid scaffolds have been overlooked. Meanwhile, the recent identification of the first sesterterpene synthase has allowed the discovery of new sesterterpenoids by the genome mining approach. In this study, we characterized the unusual fungal sesterterpene synthase EvQS and successfully obtained the sesterterpene quiannulatene (1) with a novel and unique highly congested carbon skeleton, which is further oxidized to quiannulatic acid (2) by the cytochrome P450 Qnn-P450. A mechanistic study of its cyclization from GFPP indicated that the biosynthesis employs an unprecedented cyclization mode, which involves three rounds of hydride shifts and two successive C\xe2\x80\x93C bond migrations to construct the 5-6-5-5-5 fused ring system of 1."
"Solar-to-chemical energy conversion is a challenging subject for renewable energy storage. In the past 40 years, overall water splitting into H2 and O2 by semiconductor photocatalysis has been studied extensively; however, they need noble metals and extreme care to avoid explosion of the mixed gases. Here we report that generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and O2 by organic semiconductor photocatalysts could provide a new basis for clean energy storage without metal and explosion risk. We found that carbon nitride\xe2\x80\x93aromatic diimide\xe2\x80\x93graphene nanohybrids prepared by simple hydrothermal\xe2\x80\x93calcination procedure produce H2O2 from pure water and O2 under visible light (\xce\xbb > 420 nm). Photoexcitation of the semiconducting carbon nitride\xe2\x80\x93aromatic diimide moiety transfers their conduction band electrons to graphene and enhances charge separation. The valence band holes on the semiconducting moiety oxidize water, while the electrons on the graphene moiety promote selective two-electron reduction of O2. This metal-free system produces H2O2 with solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency 0.20%, comparable to the highest levels achieved by powdered water-splitting photocatalysts."
"In organic solar cells, photoexcitation of the donor or acceptor phase can result in different efficiencies for charge generation. We investigate this difference for four different 2-pyridyl diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) polymer\xe2\x80\x93fullerene solar cells. By comparing the external quantum efficiency spectra of the polymer solar cells fabricated with either [60]PCBM or [70]PCBM fullerene derivatives as acceptor, the efficiency of charge generation via donor excitation and acceptor excitation can both be quantified. Surprisingly, we find that to make charge transfer efficient, the offset in energy between the HOMO levels of donor and acceptor that govern charge transfer after excitation of the acceptor must be larger by \xe2\x88\xbc0.3 eV than the offset between the corresponding two LUMO levels when the donor is excited. As a consequence, the driving force required for efficient charge generation is significantly higher for excitation of the acceptor than for excitation of the donor. By comparing charge generation for a total of 16 different DPP polymers, we confirm that the minimal driving force, expressed as the photon energy loss, differs by about 0.3 eV for exciting the donor and exciting the acceptor. Marcus theory may explain the dichotomous role of exciting the donor or the acceptor on charge generation in these solar cells."
"Three new diruthenium oxyanion complexes have been prepared, crystallographically characterized, and screened for their potential to photochemically unmask a reactive Ru\xe2\x80\x94Ru\xe2\x95\x90O intermediate. The most promising candidate, Ru2(chp)4ONO2 (4, chp = 6-chloro-2-hydroxypyridinate), displays a set of signals centered around m/z = 733 amu in its MALDI-TOF mass spectrum, consistent with the formation of the [Ru2(chp)4O]+ ([6]+) ion. These signals shift to 735 amu in 4*, which contains an 18O-labeled nitrate. EPR spectroscopy and headspace GC-MS analysis indicate that NO2\xe2\x80\xa2 is released upon photolysis of 4, also consistent with the formation of 6. Photolysis of 4 in CH2Cl2 at room temperature in the presence of excess PPh3 yields OPPh3 in 173% yield; control experiments implicate 6, NO2\xe2\x80\xa2, and free NO3\xe2\x80\x93 as the active oxidants. Notably, Ru2(chp)4Cl (3) is recovered after photolysis. Since 3 is the direct precursor to 4, the results described herein constitute the first example of a synthetic cycle for oxygen atom transfer that makes use of light to generate a putative metal oxo intermediate."
"A polyterpyridinyl building block-based nutlike hexagonal bismetallo architecture with a central hollow Star of David was assembled by a stepwise strategy. This nanoarchitecture can be viewed as a recursive mathematical form that possesses a supramolecular corner-connected cyclic structure, i.e., a triangle or rhombus at various levels of scale or detail. The key metallo-organic ligand (MOL) with four uncomplexed free terpyridines was obtained by a final Suzuki cross-coupling reaction with a tetrabromoterpyridine Ru dimer. The molecular metallorhombus was prepared by reacting the MOL with a 60\xc2\xb0 bis-terpyridine and Fe2+. The giant hollow hexagonal nut with a diameter of more than 11 nm and a molecular weight of ca. 33 kDa was obtained in near-quantitative yield by mixing the two types of multi-terpyridine ligands with Fe2+. The supramolecular architecture was characterized by NMR (1H and 13C), 2D NMR (COSY and ROESY), and DOSY spectroscopies, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, traveling-wave ion mobility mass spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy."
"Structural DNA nanotechnology combines branched DNA junctions with sticky-ended cohesion to create self-assembling macromolecular architectures. One of the key goals of structural DNA nanotechnology is to construct three-dimensional (3D) crystalline lattices. Here we present a new DNA motif and a strategy that has led to the assembly of a 3D lattice. We have determined the X-ray crystal structures of two related constructs to 3.1 \xc3\x85 resolution using bromine-derivatized crystals. The motif we used employs a five-nucleotide repeating sequence that weaves through a series of two-turn DNA duplexes. The duplexes are tied into a layered structure that is organized and dictated by a concert of four-arm junctions; these in turn assemble into continuous arrays facilitated by sequence-specific sticky-ended cohesion. The 3D X-ray structure of these DNA crystals holds promise for the design of new structural motifs to create programmable 3D DNA lattices with atomic spatial resolution. The two arrays differ by the use of four or six repeats of the five-nucleotide units in the repeating but statistically disordered central strand. In addition, we report a 2D rhombuslike array formed from similar components."
Researchers create and modify a folded oligoamide structure that is capable of discriminating between structurally similar molecules for binding.
"Conjugated polymers have attracted much attention in recent years, as they can combine the best features of metals or inorganic semiconducting materials (excellent electrical and optical properties) with those of synthetic polymers (mechanical flexibility, simple processing, and low-cost production), thereby creating altogether new scientific synergies and technological opportunities. In the search for more efficient synthetic methods for the preparation of conjugated polymers, this Perspective reports advances in the field of direct (hetero)arylation polymerization. This recently developed polymerization method encompasses the formation of carbon\xe2\x80\x93carbon bonds between simple (hetero)arenes and (hetero)aryl halides, reducing both the number of synthetic steps and the production of organometallic byproducts. Along these lines, we describe the most general and adaptable reaction conditions for the preparation of high-molecular-weight, defect-free conjugated polymers. We also discuss the bottleneck presented by the utilization of certain brominated thiophene units and propose some potential solutions. It is, however, firmly believed that this polymerization method will become a versatile tool in the field of conjugated polymers by providing a desirable atom-economical alternative to standard cross-coupling polymerization reactions."
"We have constructed a synthetic mimic of the carboxysome, a cyanobacterial carbon-fixing organelle. Using an electrostatic tagging system, we coencapsulated the two key carboxysomal enzymes, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and carbonic anhydrase (CA), in an engineered protein cage based on lumazine synthase. A statistically significant kinetic effect of coencapsulated CA on RuBisCO activity was not observed under ambient or oxygen saturated conditions, suggesting that enzyme proximity alone may not be the key determinant in carboxysome function. The capsid shell protected the enzyme from proteolytic damage, a factor that could have provided early cyanobacteria with an evolutionary benefit. Our strategy to coencapsulate different proteins can easily be extended to other sequentially acting enzymes and lays down principles for developing artificial organelles to control biosynthetic pathways in vivo."
"Volume-based prediction of melting points and other properties of ionic liquids (ILs) relies on empirical relations with volumes of ions in these low-melting organic salts. Here we report an accurate way to ionic volumes by Bader\xe2\x80\x99s partitioning of electron densities from X-ray diffraction obtained via a simple database approach. For a series of 1-tetradecyl-3-methylimidazolium salts, the volumes of different anions are found to correlate linearly with melting points; larger anions giving lower-melting ILs. The volume-based concept is transferred to ionic liquid crystals (ILs that adopt liquid crystalline mesophases, ILCs) for predicting the domain of their existence from the knowledge of their constituents. For 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ILCs, linear correlations of ionic volumes with the occurrence of LC mesophase and its stability are revealed, thus paving the way to rational design of ILCs by combining suitably sized ions."
"We present a blueprint for aromatic C\xe2\x80\x93H functionalization via a combination of photocatalysis and cobalt catalysis and describe the utility of this strategy for benzene amination and hydroxylation. Without any sacrificial oxidant, we could use the dual catalyst system to produce aniline directly from benzene and ammonia, and phenol from benzene and water, both with evolution of hydrogen gas under unusually mild conditions in excellent yields and selectivities."
"A concise asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of diaryl ketones, promoted by bifunctional Ru complexes with an etherial linkage between 1,2-diphenylethylenediamine (DPEN) and \xce\xb76-arene ligands, was successfully developed. Because of the effective discrimination of substituents at the ortho position on the aryl group, unsymmetrical benzophenones were smoothly reduced in a 5:2 mixture of formic acid and triethylamine with an unprecedented level of excellent enantioselectivity. For the non-ortho-substituted benzophenones, the oxo-tethered catalyst electronically discerned biased substrates, resulting in attractive performance yielding chiral diarylmethanols with >99% ee."
"A series of conductive porous composites were obtained by the polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) in the cavities of MIL\xe2\x80\x93101(Cr). By controlling the amount of EDOT loaded into the host framework, it was possible to modulate the conductivity as well as the porosity of the composite. This approach yields materials with a reasonable electronic conductivity (1.1 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x923 S\xc2\xb7cm\xe2\x80\x931) while maintaining high porosity (SBET = 803 m2/g). This serves as a promising strategy for obtaining highly nanotextured conductive polymers with very high accessibility for small gas molecules, which are beneficial to the fabrication of a chemiresistive sensor for the detection of NO2."
"Molecular assembly with magnetic bistability has been of considerable interest for application as electronic devices. In contrast to transition-metal complexes, magnetic bistability so far observed in organic radical crystals is mainly caused by intermolecular electron-exchange interaction. We now report that the magnetic bistability in an organic radical can also be caused by intramolecular electron-exchange interaction. The diradical salt of 1,4-di(bisphenylamino)-2,3,5,6,-tetramethylbenzene undergoes a phase transition with a thermal hysteresis loop over the temperature range from 118 to 131 K. The phases above and below the loop correspond to two different singlet states of the diradical dication. The results provide a novel organic radical material as an unprecedented instance of an intramolecular magnetic bistability revalent to the design of functional materials."
"While the chemical composition of semiconducting metal halide perovskites can be precisely controlled in thin films for photovoltaic devices, the synthesis of perovskite nanostructures with tunable dimensions and composition has not been realized. Here, we describe the templated synthesis of uniform perovskite nanowires with controlled diameter (50\xe2\x80\x93200 nm). Importantly, by providing three examples (CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbBr3, and Cs2SnI6), we show that this process is composition general and results in oriented nanowire arrays on transparent conductive substrates."
"Metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs), by virtue of their remarkable uptake capability, selectivity, and ease of regeneration, hold great promise for carbon capture from fossil fuel combustion. However, their stability toward moisture together with the competitive adsorption of water against CO2 drastically dampens their capacity and selectivity under real humid flue gas conditions. In this work, an effective strategy was developed to tackle the above obstacles by partitioning the channels of MOFs into confined, hydrophobic compartments by in situ polymerization of aromatic acetylenes. Specifically, polynaphthylene was formed via a radical reaction inside the channels of MOF-5 and served as partitions without altering the underlying structure of the framework. Compared with pristine MOF-5, the resultant material (PN@MOF-5) exhibits a doubled CO2 capacity (78 vs 38 cm3/g at 273 K and 1 bar), 23 times higher CO2/N2 selectivity (212 vs 9), and significantly improved moisture stability. The dynamic CO2 adsorption capacity can be largely maintained (>90%) under humid conditions during cycles. This strategy can be applied to other MOF materials and may shed light on the design of new MOF\xe2\x80\x93polymer materials with tunable pore sizes and environments to promote their practical applications."
"Ultrasmall metal nanoparticles (MNPs) were decorated on soluble porous coordination polymers (PCPs) with high metal loadings. The solubility of the composite and the size of the MNPs can be controlled by varying the ratio of the precursors to the supports. The soluble PCPs can serve as a platform to homogenize heterogeneous MNPs catalysts, which exhibited excellent activity and recyclability in C\xe2\x80\x93H activation and Suzuki reactions. This strategy combines the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis and may bring new inspiration to catalysis."
"Biosensors with direct electron output hold promise for nearly seamless integration with portable electronic devices. However, so far, they have been based on naturally occurring enzymes that significantly limit the spectrum of detectable analytes. Here, we present a novel biosensor architecture based on analyte-driven intermolecular recombination and activity reconstitution of a re-engineered component of glucometers: PQQ-glucose dehydrogenase. We demonstrate that this sensor architecture can be rapidly adopted for the detection of immunosuppressant drugs, \xce\xb1-amylase protein, or protease activity of thrombin and Factor Xa. The biosensors could be stored in dried form without appreciable loss of activity. We further show that ligand-induced activity of the developed biosensors could be directly monitored by chronoamperometry, enabling construction of disposable sensory electrodes. We expect that this architecture could be expanded to the detection of other biochemical activities, post-translational modifications, nucleic acids, and inorganic molecules."
"Compounds with polarizable \xcf\x80 systems that are susceptible to attack with nucleophiles at C\xe2\x80\x93Hal (Hal = Cl, Br) bonds react with Pd(PPh3)4 to yield net oxidative addition. X-ray structures show that the resulting Pd(PPh3)2Hal groups greatly reduce intermolecular \xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93\xcf\x80 interactions. The Pd-functionalized dyes generally exhibit solution-like absorption spectra in films, whereas their Hal analogues exhibit features attributable to aggregation."
"In this work a new ultrafast data collection strategy for electron diffraction tomography is presented that allows reducing data acquisition time by one order of magnitude. This methodology minimizes the radiation damage of beam-sensitive materials, such as microporous materials. This method, combined with the precession of the electron beam, provides high quality data enabling the determination of very complex structures. Most importantly, the implementation of this new electron diffraction methodology is easily affordable in any modern electron microscope. As a proof of concept, we have solved a new highly complex zeolitic structure named ITQ-58, with a very low symmetry (triclinic) and a large unit cell volume (1874.6 \xc3\x853), containing 16 silicon and 32 oxygen atoms in its asymmetric unit, which would be very difficult to solve with the state of the art techniques."
"Finding new ways to construct crystalline multiple-component covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has become an important focus. Herein we report the synthesis of three novel COFs containing a homogeneous and heterogeneous distribution of \xcf\x80-conjugated dehydrobenzoannulene (DBA) vertex units. The COFs were synthesized by reacting different ratios of C3-symmetric DBA catechol monomers with C2-symmetric pyrene-2,7-diboronic acid (PDBA) to yield three COFs, Py-DBA-COF 1, Py-DBA-COF 2, and Py-MV-DBA-COF. All three materials are highly crystalline and display unique luminescent properties in the solid state."
"The P-cluster is a unique iron\xe2\x80\x93sulfur center that likely functions as a dynamic electron (e\xe2\x80\x93) relay site between the Fe-protein and the catalytic FeMo-cofactor in nitrogenase. The P-cluster has been shown to undergo large conformational changes upon 2-e\xe2\x80\x93 oxidation which entail the coordination of two of the Fe centers to a Ser side chain and a backbone amide N, respectively. Yet, how and if this 2-e\xe2\x80\x93 oxidized state (POX) is involved in catalysis by nitrogenase is not well established. Here, we present the crystal structures of reduced and oxidized MoFe-protein (MoFeP) from Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus (Gd), which natively possesses an Ala residue in the position of the Ser ligand to the P-cluster. While reduced Gd-MoFeP is structurally identical to previously characterized counterparts around the FeMo-cofactor, oxidized Gd-MoFeP features an unusual Tyr coordination to its P-cluster along with ligation by a backbone amide nitrogen. EPR analysis of the oxidized Gd-MoFeP P-cluster confirmed that it is a 2-e\xe2\x80\x93 oxidized, integer-spin species. Importantly, we have found that the sequence positions corresponding to the Ser and Tyr ligands are almost completely covariant among Group I nitrogenases. These findings strongly support the possibility that the POX state is functionally relevant in nitrogenase catalysis and that a hard, O-based anionic ligand serves to stabilize this state in a switchable fashion."
"Splitting of alcohols into hydrogen and corresponding carbonyl compounds has potential applications in hydrogen production and chemical industry. Herein, we report that a heterogeneous photocatalyst (Ni-modified CdS nanoparticles) could efficiently split alcohols into hydrogen and corresponding aldehydes or ketones in a stoichiometric manner under visible light irradiation. Optimized apparent quantum yields of 38%, 46%, and 48% were obtained at 447 nm for dehydrogenation of methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol, respectively. In the case of dehydrogenation of 2-propanol, a turnover number of greater than 44\xe2\x80\xaf000 was achieved. To our knowledge, these are unprecedented values for photocatalytic splitting of liquid alcohols under visible light to date. Besides, the current catalyst system functions well with other aliphatic and aromatic alcohols, affording the corresponding carbonyl compounds with good to excellent conversion and outstanding selectivity. Moreover, mechanistic investigations suggest that an interface between Ni nanocrystal and CdS plays a key role in the reaction mechanism of the photocatalytic splitting of alcohol."
"Iron-catalyzed C\xe2\x80\x93H functionalization of aromatics has attracted widespread attention from chemists in recent years, while the requirement of an elaborate directing group on the substrate has so far hampered the use of simple aromatic carbonyl compounds such as benzoic acid and ketones, much reducing its synthetic utility. We describe here a combination of a mildly reactive methylaluminum reagent and a new tridentate phosphine ligand for metal catalysis, 4-(bis(2-(diphenylphosphanyl)phenyl)phosphanyl)-N,N-dimethylaniline (Me2N-TP), that allows us to convert an ortho C\xe2\x80\x93H bond to a C\xe2\x80\x93CH3 bond in aromatics and heteroaromatics bearing simple carbonyl groups under mild oxidative conditions. The reaction is powerful enough to methylate all four ortho C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds in benzophenone. The reaction tolerates a variety of functional groups, such as boronic ester, halide, sulfide, heterocycles, and enolizable ketones."
"Structurally well-defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have attracted great interest as next-generation semiconductor materials. The functionalization of GNRs with polymeric side chains, which can widely broaden GNR-related studies on physiochemical properties and potential applications, has remained unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the bottom-up solution synthesis of defect-free GNRs grafted with flexible poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chains. The GNR backbones possess an armchair edge structure with a width of 1.0\xe2\x80\x931.7 nm and mean lengths of 15\xe2\x80\x9360 nm, enabling near-infrared absorption and a low bandgap of 1.3 eV. Remarkably, the PEO grafting renders the GNRs superb dispersibility in common organic solvents, with a record concentration of \xe2\x88\xbc1 mg mL\xe2\x80\x931 (for GNR backbone) that is much higher than that (<0.01 mg mL\xe2\x80\x931) of reported GNRs. Moreover, the PEO-functionalized GNRs can be readily dispersed in water, accompanying with supramolecular helical nanowire formation. Scanning probe microscopy reveals raft-like self-assembled monolayers of uniform GNRs on graphite substrates. Thin-film-based field-effect transistors (FETs) of the GNRs exhibit a high carrier mobility of \xe2\x88\xbc0.3 cm2 V\xe2\x80\x931 s\xe2\x80\x931, manifesting promising application of the polymer-functionalized GNRs in electronic devices."
"The crystalline sponge method was used for the X-ray structure analysis of ozonide compounds. As this new technique requires only microgram quantities of the samples, structural analysis can be conducted without product isolation, isomer separation, or crystallization and most importantly without any risk of explosion."
"The drug olsalazine (H4olz) was employed as a ligand to synthesize a new series of mesoporous metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks that are expanded analogues of the well-known M2(dobdc) materials (dobdc4\xe2\x80\x93 = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; M-MOF-74). The M2(olz) frameworks (M = Mg, Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn) exhibit high surface areas with large hexagonal pore apertures that are approximately 27 \xc3\x85 in diameter. Variable temperature H2 adsorption isotherms revealed strong adsorption at the open metal sites, and in situ infrared spectroscopy experiments on Mg2(olz) and Ni2(olz) were used to determine site-specific H2 binding enthalpies. In addition to its capabilities for gas sorption, the highly biocompatible Mg2(olz) framework was also evaluated as a platform for the delivery of olsalazine and other encapsulated therapeutics. The Mg2(olz) material (86 wt % olsalazine) was shown to release the therapeutic linker through dissolution of the framework under simulated physiological conditions. Furthermore, Mg2(olz) was used to encapsulate phenethylamine (PEA), a model drug for a broad class of bioactive compounds. Under simulated physiological conditions, Mg2(olz)(PEA)2 disassembled to release PEA from the pores and olsalazine from the framework itself, demonstrating that multiple therapeutic components can be delivered together at different rates. The low toxicity, high surface areas, and coordinatively unsaturated metal sites make these M2(olz) materials promising for a range of potential applications, including drug delivery in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases."
"On-surface synthesis involving the homocoupling of aryl-alkynes affords the buildup of bisacetylene derivatives directly at surfaces, which in turn may be further used as ingredients for the production of novel functional materials. Generally, homocoupling of terminal alkynes takes place by thermal activation of molecular precursors on metal surfaces. However, the interaction of alkynes with surface metal atoms often induces unwanted reaction pathways when thermal energy is provided to the system. In this contribution we report about light-induced metal-free homocoupling of terminal alkynes on highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG). The reaction occurred with high efficiency and selectivity within a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of aryl-alkynes and led to the generation of large domains of ordered butadiynyl derivatives. Such a photochemical uncatalyzed pathway represents an original approach in the field of topological C\xe2\x80\x93C coupling at the solid/liquid interface."
"Here, we report DNA-induced polymer segregation and DNA island formation in binary block copolymer assemblies. A DNA diblock copolymer of polymethyl acrylate-block-DNA (PMA-b-DNA) and a triblock copolymer of poly(butadiene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide)-block-DNA (PBD-b-PEO-b-DNA) were synthesized, and each was coassembled with a prototypical amphiphilic polymer of poly(butadiene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PBD-b-PEO). The binary self-assembly of PMA-b-DNA and PBD-b-PEO resulted in giant polymersomes with DNA uniformly distributed in the hydrophilic PEO shell. When giant polymersomes were connected through specific DNA interactions, DNA block copolymers migrated to the junction area, forming DNA islands within polymersomes. These results indicate that DNA hybridization can induce effective lateral polymer segregation in mixed polymer assemblies. The polymer segregation and local DNA enrichment have important implications in DNA melting properties, as mixed block copolymer assemblies with low DNA block copolymer contents can still exhibit useful DNA melting properties that are characteristic of DNA nanostructures with high DNA density."
"In this study, the effector role of Pdx (putidaredoxin) on cytochrome P450cam conformation is refined by attaching two different spin labels, MTSL or BSL (bifunctional spin-label) onto the F or G helices and using DEER (double electron\xe2\x80\x93electron resonance) to measure the distance between labels. Recent EPR and crystallographic studies have observed that oxidized Pdx induces substrate-bound P450cam to change from the closed to the open state. However, this change was not observed by DEER in the reduced Pdx complex with carbon-monoxide-bound P450cam (Fe2+CO). In addition, recent NMR studies have failed to observe a change in P450cam conformation upon binding Pdx. Hence, resolving these issues is important for a full understanding the effector role of Pdx. Here we show that oxidized Pdx induces camphor-bound P450cam to shift from the closed to the open conformation when labeled on either the F or G helices with MTSL. BSL at these sites can either narrow the distance distribution widths dramatically or alter the extent of the conformational change. In addition, we report DEER spectra on a mixed oxidation state containing oxidized Pdx and ferrous CO-bound P450cam, showing that P450cam remains closed. This indicates that CO binding to the heme prevents P450cam from opening, overriding the influence exerted by Pdx binding. Finally, we report the open form P450cam crystal structure with substrate bound, which suggests that crystal packing effects may prevent conformational conversion. Using multiple labeling approaches, DEER provides a unique perspective to resolve how the conformation of P450cam depends on Pdx and ligand states."
"To address the limitations of batch organic\xe2\x80\x93aqueous biphasic catalysis, we develop a conceptually novel method termed Flow Pickering Emulsion, or FPE, to process biphasic reactions in a continuous flow fashion. This method involves the compartmentalization of bulk water into micron-sized droplets based on a water-in-oil Pickering emulsion, which are packed into a column reactor. The compartmentalized water droplets can confine water-soluble catalysts, thus \xe2\x80\x9cimmobilizing\xe2\x80\x9d the catalyst in the column reactor, while the interstices between the droplets allow the organic (oil) phase to flow. Key fundamental principles underpinning this method such as the oil phase flow behavior, the stability of compartmentalized droplets and the confinement capability of these droplets toward water-soluble catalysts are experimentally and theoretically investigated. As a proof of this concept, case studies including a sulfuric acid-catalyzed addition reaction, a heteropolyacid-catalyzed ring opening reaction and an enzyme-catalyzed chiral reaction demonstrate the generality and versatility of the FPE method. Impressively, in addition to the excellent durability, the developed FPE reactions exhibit up to 10-fold reaction efficiency enhancement in comparison to the existing batch reactions, indicating a unique flow interface catalysis effect. This study opens up a new avenue to allow conventional biphasic catalysis reactions to access more sustainable and efficient flow chemistry using an innovative liquid\xe2\x80\x93liquid interface protocol."
"Two kinds of conjugated C3-symmetric perylene dyes, namely, triperylene hexaimides (TPH) and selenium-annulated triperylene hexaimides (TPH-Se), are efficiently synthesized. Both TPH and TPH-Se have broad and strong absorption in the region 300\xe2\x80\x93600 nm together with suitable LUMO levels of about \xe2\x88\x923.8 eV. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies show that TPH displays an extremely twisted three-bladed propeller configuration and a unique 3D network assembly in which three PBI subunits in one TPH molecule have strong \xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93\xcf\x80 intermolecular interactions with PBI subunits in neighboring molecules. The integration of selenophene to TPH endows TPH-Se with a more distorted propeller configuration and a more compact 3D network assembly due to the Se\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O interactions. A single-crystal transistor confirms that both TPH and TPH-Se possess good electron-transport ability. TPH and TPH-Se acceptor-based solar cells show high power conversion efficiency of 8.28% and 9.28%, respectively, which mainly results from the combined properties of broad and strong absorption ability, appropriate LUMO level, desirable aggregation, high electron mobility, and good film morphology with the polymer donor."
"Conversion of CO2 and CH4 to value-added products will contribute to alleviating the green-house gas effect but is a challenge both scientifically and practically. Stabilization of the methyl group through CH4 activation and facile CO2 insertion ensure the realization of C\xe2\x80\x93C coupling. In the present study, we demonstrate the ready C\xe2\x80\x93C coupling reaction on a Zn-doped ceria catalyst. The detailed mechanism of this direct C\xe2\x80\x93C coupling reaction was examined based on the results from density functional theory calculations. The results show that the Zn dopant stabilizes the methyl group by forming a Zn\xe2\x80\x93C bond, thus hindering subsequent dehydrogenation of CH4. CO2 can be inserted into the Zn\xe2\x80\x93C bond in an activated bent configuration, with the transition state in the form of a three-centered Zn\xe2\x80\x93C\xe2\x80\x93C moiety and an activation barrier of 0.51 eV. The C\xe2\x80\x93C coupling reaction resulted in the acetate species, which could desorb as acetic acid by combining with a surface proton. The formation of acetic acid from CO2 and CH4 is a reaction with 100% atom economy, and the implementation of the reaction on a heterogeneous catalyst is of great importance to the utilization of the greenhouse gases. We tested other possible dopants including Al, Ga, Cd, In, and Ni and found a positive correlation between the activation barrier of C\xe2\x80\x93C coupling and the electronegativity of the dopant, although C\xe2\x80\x93H bond activation is likely the dominant reaction on the Ni-doped ceria catalyst."
"Using detailed first-principles calculations, we investigate the hopping rate of vacancies in phosphorene, an emerging elemental 2D material besides graphene. Our work predicts that a direct observation of these monovacancies (MVs), showing a highly mobile and anisotropic motion, is possible only at low temperatures around 70 K or below where the thermal activity is greatly suppressed. At room temperature, the motion of a MV is 16 orders faster than that in graphene, because of the low diffusion barrier of 0.3 eV. Built-in strain associated with the vacancies extends far along the zigzag direction while attenuating rapidly along the armchair direction. We reveal new features of the motion of divacancies (DVs) in phosphorene via multiple dissociation\xe2\x80\x93recombination processes of vacancies owing to a small energy cost of \xe2\x88\xbc1.05 eV for the splitting of a DV into two MVs. Furthermore, we find that uniaxial tensile strain along the zigzag direction can promote the motion of MVs, while the tensile strain along the armchair direction has the opposite effect. These itinerant features of vacancies, rooted in the unique puckering structure facilitating bond reorganization, enable phosphorene to be a bright new opportunity to broaden the knowledge of the evolution of vacancies, and a proper control of the exceedingly active and anisotropic movement of the vacancies should be critical for applications based on phosphorene."
"We report the synthesis of copper iron sulfide (CuFeS2) quantum dots (QDs). These materials exhibit a tunable band gap that spans the range 0.5\xe2\x80\x932 eV (600\xe2\x80\x932500 nm). Although the as-prepared material is nonemissive, CuFeS2/CdS core/shell structures are shown to exhibit quantum yields that exceed 80%. Like other members of the I\xe2\x80\x93III\xe2\x80\x93VI2 family QDs, CuFeS2 based nanoparticles exhibit a long-lived emission that is significantly red-shifted compared to the band gap. CuFeS2 QDs are unique in terms of their composition. In particular, these QDs are the only band-gap-tunable infrared chromophore composed entirely of elements with atomic numbers less than 30."
"Template-directed protocols provide a routine approach to the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), in which the mechanical bonds are stabilized by a wide variety of weak interactions. In this Article, we describe a strategy for the preparation of neutral [2]catenanes with sliding interlocked electron-rich rings, starting from two degenerate donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor [2]catenanes, consisting of a tetracationic cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) cyclophane (CBPQT4+) and crown ethers containing either (i) hydroquinone (HQ) or (ii) 1,5-dioxynaphthalene (DNP) recognition units and carrying out four-electron reductions of the cyclophane components to their neutral forms. The donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor interactions between the CBPQT4+ ring and both HQ and DNP units present in the crown ethers that stabilize the [2]catenanes are weakened upon reduction of the cyclophane components to their radical cationic states and are all but absent in their fully reduced states. Characterization in solution performed by UV\xe2\x80\x93vis, EPR, and NMR spectroscopic probes reveals that changes in the redox properties of the [2]catenanes result in a substantial decrease of the energy barriers for the circumrotation and pirouetting motions of the interlocked rings, which glide freely through one another in the neutral states. The solid-state structures of the fully reduced catenanes reveal profound changes in the relative dispositions of the interlocked rings, with the glycol chains of the crown ethers residing in the cavities of the neutral CBPQT0 rings. Quantum mechanical investigations of the energy levels associated with the four different oxidation states of the catenanes support this interpretation. Catenanes and rotaxanes with sliding rings are expected to display unique properties."
"Flexible power sources with high energy density are crucial for the realization of next-generation flexible electronics. Theoretically, rechargeable flexible zinc\xe2\x80\x93air (Zn\xe2\x80\x93air) batteries could provide high specific energy, while their large-scale applications are still greatly hindered by high cost and resources scarcity of noble-metal-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts as well as inferior mechanical properties of the air cathode. Combining metallic Co4N with superior OER activity and Co\xe2\x80\x93N\xe2\x80\x93C with perfect ORR activity on a free-standing and flexible electrode could be a good step for flexible Zn\xe2\x80\x93air batteries, while lots of difficulties need to be overcome. Herein, as a proof-of-concept experiment, we first propose a strategy for in situ coupling of strung Co4N and intertwined N\xe2\x80\x93C fibers, by pyrolyzation of the novel pearl-like ZIF-67/polypyrrole nanofibers network rooted on carbon cloth. Originating from the synergistic effect of Co4N and Co\xe2\x80\x93N\xe2\x80\x93C and the stable 3D interconnected conductive network structure, the obtained free-standing and highly flexible bifunctional oxygen electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for both OER and ORR in terms of low overpotential (310 mV at 10 mA cm\xe2\x80\x932) for OER, a positive half-wave potential (0.8 V) for ORR, and a stable current density retention for at least 20 h, and especially, the obtained Zn\xe2\x80\x93air batteries exhibit a low discharge\xe2\x80\x93charge voltage gap (1.09 V at 50 mA cm\xe2\x80\x932) and long cycle life (up to 408 cycles). Furthermore, the perfect bendable and twistable and rechargeable properties of the flexible Zn\xe2\x80\x93air battery particularly make it a potentially power portable and wearable electronic device."
"The manufacture of advanced polyolefins has been critically enabled by the development of single-site heterogeneous catalysts. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show great potential as heterogeneous catalysts that may be designed and tuned on the molecular level. In this work, exchange of zinc ions in Zn5Cl4(BTDD)3, H2BTDD = bis(1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b],[4\xe2\x80\xb2,5\xe2\x80\xb2-i])dibenzo[1,4]dioxin) (MFU-4l) with reactive metals serves to establish a general platform for selective olefin polymerization in a high surface area solid promising for industrial catalysis. Characterization of polyethylene produced by these materials demonstrates both molecular and morphological control. Notably, reactivity approaches single-site catalysis, as evidenced by low polydispersity indices, and good molecular weight control. We further show that these new catalysts copolymerize ethylene and propylene. Uniform growth of the polymer around the catalyst particles provides a mechanism for controlling the polymer morphology, a relevant metric for continuous flow processes."
"Nanometer-sized materials attract much attention because their physical and chemical properties are substantially different from those of bulk materials owing to their size and surface effects. In this work,  neutron powder diffraction experiments on the nanoparticles of palladium hydride, which is the most popular metal hydride, have been performed at 300, 150, and 44 K to investigate the positions of the hydrogen atoms in the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice of palladium. We used high-quality PdD0.363 nanocrystals with a diameter of 8.0 \xc2\xb1 0.9 nm. The Rietveld analysis revealed that 30% of D atoms are located at the tetrahedral (T) sites and 70% at the octahedral (O) sites. In contrast,  only the O sites are occupied in bulk palladium hydride and in most fcc metal hydrides. The temperature dependence of the T-site occupancy suggested that the T-sites are occupied only in a limited part, probably in the subsurface region, of the nanoparticles. This is the first study to determine the hydrogen sites in metal nanoparticles."
"High methane storage capacity in porous materials is important for the design and manufacture of vehicles powered by natural gas. Here, we report the synthesis, crystal structures and methane adsorption properties of five new zinc metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs), MOF-905, MOF-905-Me2, MOF-905-Naph, MOF-905-NO2, and MOF-950. All these MOFs consist of the Zn4O(\xe2\x88\x92CO2)6 secondary building units (SBUs) and benzene-1,3,5-tri-\xce\xb2-acrylate, BTAC. The permanent porosity of all five materials was confirmed, and their methane adsorption measured up to 80 bar to reveal that MOF-905 is among the best performing methane storage materials with a volumetric working capacity (desorption at 5 bar) of 203 cm3 cm\xe2\x80\x933 at 80 bar and 298 K, a value rivaling that of HKUST-1 (200 cm3 cm\xe2\x80\x933), the benchmark compound for methane storage in MOFs. This study expands the scope of MOF materials with ultrahigh working capacity to include linkers having the common acrylate connectivity."
"The organic electrochemical transistor (OECT), capable of transducing small ionic fluxes into electronic signals in an aqueous environment, is an ideal device to utilize in bioelectronic applications. Currently, most OECTs are fabricated with commercially available conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-based suspensions and are therefore operated in depletion mode. Here, we present a series of semiconducting polymers designed to elucidate important structure\xe2\x80\x93property guidelines required for accumulation mode OECT operation. We discuss key aspects relating to OECT performance such as ion and hole transport, electrochromic properties, operational voltage, and stability. The demonstration of our molecular design strategy is the fabrication of accumulation mode OECTs that clearly outperform state-of-the-art PEDOT-based devices, and show stability under aqueous operation without the need for formulation additives and cross-linkers."
"Metal sulfides are highly active photocatalysts for water reduction to form H2 under visible light irradiation, whereas they are unfavorable for water oxidation to form O2 because of severe self-photooxidation (i.e., photocorrosion). Construction of a Z-scheme system is a useful strategy to split water into H2 and O2 using such photocorrosive metal sulfides because the photogenerated holes in metal sulfides are efficiently transported away. Here, we demonstrate powdered Z-schematic water splitting under visible light and simulated sunlight irradiation by combining metal sulfides as an H2-evolving photocatalyst, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as an electron mediator, and a visible-light-driven BiVO4 as an O2-evolving photocatalyst. This Z-schematic photocatalyst composite is also active in CO2 reduction using water as the sole electron donor under visible light."
"The development of semiconducting polymers is imperative to improve the performance of polymer-based solar cells (PSCs). In this study, new semiconducting polymers based on naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c\xe2\x80\xb2]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NTz), PNTz4TF2 and PNTz4TF4, having 3,3\xe2\x80\xb2-difluoro-2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-bithiophene and 3,3\xe2\x80\xb2,4,4\xe2\x80\xb2-tetrafluoro-2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-bithiophene, respectively, are designed and synthesized. These polymers possess a deeper HOMO energy level than their counterpart, PNTz4T, which results in higher open-circuit voltages in solar cells. This concequently reduces the photon energy loss that is one of the most important issues surrounding PSCs. The PNTz4TF4 cell exhibits up to 6.5% power conversion efficiency (PCE), whereas the PNTz4TF2 cell demonstrates outstanding device performance with as high as 10.5% PCE, which is quite high for PSCs. We further discuss the performances of the PSCs based on these polymers by correlating the charge generation and recombination dynamics with the polymer structure and ordering structure. We believe that the results provide new insights into the design of semiconducting polymers and that there is still much room for improvement of PSC efficiency."
"A lithium enolate derived from an acetonide-protected pyroglutaminol undergoes a highly selective azaaldol addition with (E)-N-phenyl-1-[2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methanimine. The selectivity is sensitive to tetrahydrofuran (THF) concentration, temperature, and the presence of excess lithium diisopropylamide base. Rate studies show that the observable tetrasolvated dimeric enolate undergoes reversible deaggregation, with the reaction proceeding via a disolvated-monomer-based transition structure. Limited stereochemical erosion stems from the intervention of a trisolvated-monomer-based pathway, which is suppressed at low THF concentrations and elevated temperature. Endofacial selectivity observed with excess lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is traced to an intermediate dianion formed by subsequent lithiation of the monomeric azaaldol adduct, which is characterized as both a dilithio form and a trilithio dianion\xe2\x80\x93LDA mixed aggregate."
"The mechanisms of ion permeation through potassium channels have been extensively examined. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have demonstrated that rapidly permeating ions collide near the selectivity filter (SF) (\xe2\x80\x9cknock-on\xe2\x80\x9d mechanism), but this oversimplified mechanism is insufficient to account for the experimentally observed single-channel current amplitudes. Here, we analyzed the MD-simulated ion trajectories through a Kv1.2 potassium channel using an event-oriented analysis method, and surprisingly, we found that the nanocavity (NC) governs ion permeation in a digital fashion. The NC has a maximal diameter of 10 \xc3\x85 and stands between the intracellular bulk solution and the SF, which holds only up to one K+ during permeation. Accordingly, the K+ concentration in the intracellular solution is translated as a digitalized zero or one K+ in the NC. When the ion number in the NC is zero, the multiple ions in the SF are mostly immobilized. By contrast, when the number of ions in the NC is one, the structured water in the NC mediates the ion-occupied status to the queueing ions in the SF, and the ions then initiate a collective outward motion. Accordingly, the one ion in the NC serves as a catalytic intermediate for permeation, which quantitatively accounts for the experimentally obtained conductance\xe2\x80\x93concentration relationships. We conclude that the ion movements are coherent across the entire pore."
"We describe a new strategy to generate non-coordinating anions using zwitterionic metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs). By assembly of anionic inorganic secondary building blocks (SBUs) ([In(CO2)4]\xe2\x88\x92) with cationic metalloporphyrin-based organic linkers, we prepared zwitterionic MOFs in which the complete internal charge separation effectively prevents the potential binding of the counteranion to the cationic metal center. We demonstrate the enhanced Lewis acidity of MnIII- and FeIII-porphyrins in the zwitterionic MOFs in three representative electrocyclization reactions: [2 + 1] cycloisomerization of enynes, [3 + 2] cycloaddition of aziridines and alkenes, and [4 + 2] hetero-Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder cycloaddition of aldehydes with dienes. This work paves a new way to design functional MOFs for tunable chemical catalysis."
"Double roughness structure, the origin of the lotus effect of natural lotus leaf, was successfully reproduced on a diarylethene microcrystalline surface. Static superwater-repellency and dynamic water-drop-bouncing were observed on the surface, in the manner of natural lotus leaves. Double roughness structure was essential for water-drop-bouncing. This ability was not observed on a single roughness microcrystalline surface showing the lotus effect of the same diarylethene derivative. The double roughness structure was reversibly controlled by alternating irradiation with UV and visible light."
"Kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of the \xce\xb2-dicarbonyl-substituted iodonium ylides 1(a\xe2\x80\x93d) with several \xcf\x80-conjugated carbenium and iminium ions have been investigated. All reactions proceed with rate-determining attack of the electrophile at the nucleophilic carbon center of the ylides to give iodonium ions, which rapidly expel iodobenzene and undergo different subsequent reactions. The second-order rate constants k2 for the reactions of the iodonium ylides with benzhydrylium ions correlate linearly with the electrophilicity parameters E of the benzhydrylium ions and thus follow the linear free energy relationship log k(20 \xc2\xb0C) = sN(N + E) (eq 1), where electrophiles are characterized by one parameter (E), while nucleophiles are characterized by two parameters: the nucleophilicity N and the susceptibility sN. The nucleophilicity parameters 4 < N < 8 for iodonium ylides 1(a\xe2\x80\x93d) derived from these correlations show that substituting hydrogen for Ph-I+ at the carbanionic center of Meldrum\xe2\x80\x99s acid or dimedone, respectively, reduces the nucleophilicity by approximately 10 orders of magnitude. The iodonium ylides 1(a\xe2\x80\x93d) thus have nucleophilicities similar to those of pyrroles, indoles, and silylated enol ethers and, therefore, should be suitable substrates in iminium-activated reactions. Good agreement of the measured rate constant for the cyclopropanation of the imidazolidinone-derived iminium ion 10a with the iodonium ylide 1a with the rate constant calculated by eq 1 suggests a stepwise mechanism in which the initial nucleophilic attack of the iodonium ylide at the iminium ion is rate-determining. The reaction of cinnamaldehyde with iodonium ylide 1a catalyzed by (5S)-5-benzyl-2,2,3-trimethyl-imidazolidin-4-one (11a, MacMillan\xe2\x80\x99s first-generation catalyst) gives the corresponding cyclopropane with an enantiomeric ratio of 70/30 and, thus, provides proof of principle that iodonium ylides are suitable substrates for iminium-activated cyclopropanations."
"A synthetic helical aromatic oligoamide foldamer receptor with high affinity and selectivity for tartaric acid was subjected to a structure-based evolution of its sequence via mutations, additions, and deletions of monomers to produce a new receptor having high affinity and selectivity for malic acid, a guest that differs from tartaric acid by a single oxygen atom. Seven iteratively modified sequences were synthesized. Detailed structural investigations of host\xe2\x80\x93guest complexes were carried out systematically to guide the design of the next generation. A first outcome was a reversal of selectivity of the receptors, with a starting preference for tartaric acid over malic acid of over 102 and an ending sequence showing a preference for malic acid over tartaric acid of over 102. Another outcome was a very strong enhancement of the affinity for malic acid, despite the fact that it has fewer recognition features for binding through polar interactions such as hydrogen bonds. Such a level of discrimination between resembling guests exemplifies the amenability of foldamers to outstanding achievements in molecular recognition. Altogether, our results demonstrate the viability of a rational receptor design approach that exploits the modularity of foldamer sequences and, in the case of aromatic amide foldamers, their amenability to structural elucidation, their relative ease of synthesis, and the predictability of their structure."
"Higher order acenes (i.e., acenes longer than pentacene) and extended zethrenes (i.e., zethrenes longer than zethrene) are theoretically predicted to have an open-shell singlet ground state, and the radical character is supposed to increase with extension of molecular size. The increasing radical character makes the synthesis of long zethrenes and acenes very challenging, and so far, the longest reported zethrene and acene derivatives are octazethrene and nonacene, respectively. In addition, there is a lack of fundamental understanding of the differences between these two closely related open-shell singlet systems. In this work, we report the first synthesis of a challenging nonazethrene derivative, HR-NZ, and its full structural and physical characterizations including variable temperature NMR, ESR, SQUID, UV\xe2\x80\x93vis\xe2\x80\x93NIR absorption and electrochemical measurements. Compound HR-NZ has an open-shell singlet ground state with a moderate diradical character (y0 = 0.48 based on UCAM-B3LYP calculation) and a small singlet\xe2\x80\x93triplet gap (\xce\x94ES\xe2\x80\x93T = \xe2\x88\x925.2 kcal/mol based on SQUID data), thus showing magnetic activity at room temperature. It also shows amphoteric redox behavior, with a small electrochemical energy gap (1.33 eV). Its electronic structure and physical properties are compared with those of Anthony\xe2\x80\x99s nonacene derivative JA-NA and other zethrene derivatives. A more general comparison between higher order acenes and extended zethrenes was also conducted on the basis of ab initio electronic structure calculations, and it was found that zethrenes and acenes have very different spatial localization of the unpaired electrons. As a result, a faster decrease of singlet\xe2\x80\x93triplet energy gap and a faster increase of radical character with increase of the number of benzenoid rings were observed in zethrene series. Our studies reveal that spatial localization of the frontier molecular orbitals play a very important role on the nature of radical character as well as the excitation energy."
"Lead halide perovskites have over the past few years attracted considerable interest as photo absorbers in PV applications with record efficiencies now reaching 22%. It has recently been found that not only the composition but also the precise stoichiometry is important for the device performance. Recent reports have, for example, demonstrated small amount of PbI2 in the perovskite films to be beneficial for the overall performance of both the standard perovskite, CH3NH3PbI3, as well as for the mixed perovskites (CH3NH3)x(CH(NH2)2)(1\xe2\x80\x93x)PbBryI(3\xe2\x80\x93y). In this work a broad range of characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photo electron spectroscopy (PES), transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), UV\xe2\x80\x93vis, electroluminescence (EL), photoluminescence (PL), and confocal PL mapping have been used to further understand the importance of remnant PbI2 in perovskite solar cells. Our best devices were over 18% efficient, and had in line with previous results a small amount of excess PbI2. For the PbI2-deficient samples, the photocurrent dropped, which could be attributed to accumulation of organic species at the grain boundaries, low charge carrier mobility, and decreased electron injection into the TiO2. The PbI2-deficient compositions did, however, also have advantages. The record Voc was as high as 1.20 V and was found in PbI2-deficient samples. This was correlated with high crystal quality, longer charge carrier lifetimes, and high PL yields and was rationalized as a consequence of the dynamics of the perovskite formation. We further found the ion migration to be obstructed in the PbI2-deficient samples, which decreased the JV hysteresis and increased the photostability. PbI2-deficient synthesis conditions can thus be used to deposit perovskites with excellent crystal quality but with the downside of grain boundaries enriched in organic species, which act as a barrier toward current transport. Exploring ways to tune the synthesis conditions to give the high crystal quality obtained under PbI2-poor condition while maintaining the favorable grain boundary characteristics obtained under PbI2-rich conditions would thus be a strategy toward more efficiency devices."
"The long-range deconjugative isomerization of a broad range of \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated amides, esters, and ketones by an in situ generated palladium hydride catalyst is described. This redox-economical process is triggered by a hydrometalation event and is thermodynamically driven by the refunctionalization of a primary or a secondary alcohol into an aldehyde or a ketone. Di-, tri-, and tetrasubstituted carbon\xe2\x80\x93carbon double bonds react with similar efficiency; the system is tolerant toward a variety of functional groups, and olefin migration can be sustained over 30 carbon atoms. The refunctionalized products are usually isolated in good to excellent yield. Mechanistic investigations are in support of a chain-walking process consisting of repeated migratory insertions and \xce\xb2-H eliminations. The bidirectionality of the isomerization reaction was established by isotopic labeling experiments using a substrate with a double bond isolated from both terminal functions. The palladium hydride was also found to be directly involved in the product-forming tautomerization step. The ambiphilic character of the in situ generated [Pd\xe2\x80\x93H] was demonstrated using isomeric trisubstituted \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated esters. Finally, the high levels of enantioselectivity obtained in the isomerization of a small set of \xce\xb1-substituted \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated ketones augur well for the successful development of an enantioselective version of this unconventional isomerization."
"A simple yet effective method for the formation of thiophene-fused \xcf\x80-systems is reported. When arylethynyl-substituted polycyclic arenes were heated in DMF in the presence of elemental sulfur, the corresponding thiophene-fused polycyclic arenes were obtained via cleavage of the ortho-C\xe2\x80\x93H bond. Thus, arylethynylated naphthalenes, fluoranthenes, pyrenes, corannulenes, chrysenes, and benzo[c]naphtho[2,1-p]chrysenes were effectively converted into the corresponding thiophene-fused \xcf\x80-systems. Apart from polycyclic hydrocarbons, thiophene derivatives are also susceptible to this reaction. The practical utility of this reaction is demonstrated by preparations on the decagram scale, one-pot two-step reaction sequences, and multiple thiophene annulations."
"For the first time, H\xe2\x80\x93H dissociation on an unsupported nanoporous gold (AuNPore) surface is reported for chemoselective hydrogenation of C\xe2\x89\xa1C, C\xe2\x95\x90C, C\xe2\x95\x90N, and C\xe2\x95\x90O bonds under mild conditions (8 atm H2 pressure, 90 \xc2\xb0C). Silver doping in AuNPore, which was inevitable for its preparation through a process of dealloying of Au\xe2\x80\x93Ag alloy, exhibited a remarkable difference in catalytic activity between two catalysts, Au>99Ag1NPore and Au90Ag10NPore.The former was more active and the latter less active in H2 hydrogenation, while the reverse tendency was observed for O2 oxidation. This marked contrast between H2 reduction and O2 oxidation is discussed. Further, Au>99Ag1NPore showed a high chemoselectivity toward reduction of terminal alkynes in the presence of internal alkynes which was not achieved using supported gold nanoparticle catalysts and other previously known methods. Reductive amination, which has great significance in synthesis of amines due to its atom-economical nature, was also realized using Au>99Ag1NPore, and the Au>99Ag1NPore/H2 system showed a preference for the reduction of aldehydes in the presence of imines. In addition to this high chemoselectivity, easy recovery and high reusability of AuNPore make it a promising heterogeneous catalyst for hydrogenation reactions."
"Molecular motion of biopolymers in vivo is known to be strongly influenced by the high concentration of organic matter inside cells, usually referred to as crowding conditions. To elucidate the effect of intermolecular interactions on Brownian motion of proteins, we performed 1H pulsed-field gradient NMR and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) experiments combined with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and viscosity measurements for three proteins, \xce\xb1B-crystalline (\xce\xb1Bc), bovine serum albumin, and hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) in aqueous solution. Our results demonstrate that long-time translational diffusion quantitatively follows the expected increase of macro-viscosity upon increasing the protein concentration in all cases, while rotational diffusion as assessed by polarized FCS and previous multi-frequency 1H NMR relaxometry experiments reveals protein-specific behavior spanning the full range between the limiting cases of full decoupling from (\xce\xb1Bc) and full coupling to (HEWL) the macro-viscosity. SAXS was used to study the interactions between the proteins in solution, whereby it is shown that the three cases cover the range between a weakly interacting hard-sphere system (\xce\xb1Bc) and screened Coulomb repulsion combined with short-range attraction (HEWL). Our results, as well as insights from the recent literature, suggest that the unusual rotational\xe2\x80\x93translational coupling may be due to anisotropic interactions originating from hydrodynamic shape effects combined with high charge and possibly a patchy charge distribution."
"Scientists report a plausible reaction mechanism for the self-splicing of group II intron ribozymes, explaining the requirement for two magnesium ions."
"Group II introns are Mg2+-dependent ribozymes that are considered to be the evolutionary ancestors of the eukaryotic spliceosome, thus representing an ideal model system to understand the mechanism of conversion of premature messenger RNA (mRNA) into mature mRNA. Neither in splicing nor for self-cleaving ribozymes has the role of the two Mg2+ ions been established, and even the way the nucleophile is activated is still controversial. Here we employed hybrid quantum\xe2\x80\x93classical QM(Car\xe2\x80\x93Parrinello)/MM molecular dynamics simulations in combination with thermodynamic integration to characterize the molecular mechanism of the first and rate-determining step of the splicing process (i.e., the cleavage of the 5\xe2\x80\xb2-exon) catalyzed by group II intron ribozymes. Remarkably, our results show a new RNA-specific dissociative mechanism in which the bulk water accepts the nucleophile\xe2\x80\x99s proton during its attack on the scissile phosphate. The process occurs in a single step with no Mg2+ ion activating the nucleophile, at odds with nucleases enzymes. We suggest that the novel reaction path elucidated here might be an evolutionary ancestor of the more efficient two-metal-ion mechanism found in enzymes."
"A new series of bifunctional Ru complexes with pendent Lewis acidic boranes were prepared by late-stage modification of an active hydrogen-transfer catalyst. The appended boranes modulate the reactivity of a metal hydride as well as catalytic hydrogenations. After installing acidic auxiliary groups, the complexes become multifunctional and catalyze the cis-selective hydrogenation of alkynes with higher rates, conversions, and selectivities compared with the unmodified catalyst."
"The RNA G-quadruplex is an important secondary structure formed by guanine-rich RNA sequences. However, its folding studies have mainly been studied in vitro. Accurate identification of RNA G-quadruplex formation within a sequence of interest remains difficult in cells. Herein, and based on the guanine-rich sequence in the 5\xe2\x80\xb2-UTR of NRAS mRNA, we designed and synthesized the first G-quadruplex-triggered fluorogenic hybridization (GTFH) probe, ISCH-nras1, for the unique visualization of the G-quadruplexes that form in this region. ISCH-nras1 is made up of two parts: The first is a fluorescent light-up moiety specific to G-quadruplex structures, and the second is a DNA molecule that can hybridize with a sequence that is adjacent to the guanine-rich sequence in the NRAS mRNA 5\xe2\x80\xb2-UTR. Further evaluation studies indicated that ISCH-nras1 could directly and precisely detect the targeted NRAS RNA G-quadruplex structures, both in vitro and in cells. Thus, this GTFH probe was a useful tool for directly investigating the folding of G-quadruplex structures within an RNA of interest and represents a new direction for the design of smart RNA G-quadruplex probes."
"Protein secondary structures serve as geometrically constrained scaffolds for the display of key interacting residues at protein interfaces. Given the critical role of secondary structures in protein folding and the dependence of folding propensities on backbone dihedrals, secondary structure is expected to influence the identity of residues that are important for complex formation. Counter to this expectation, we find that a narrow set of residues dominates the binding energy in protein\xe2\x80\x93protein complexes independent of backbone conformation. This finding suggests that the binding epitope may instead be substantially influenced by the side-chain conformations adopted. We analyzed side-chain conformational preferences in residues that contribute significantly to binding. This analysis suggests that preferred rotamers contribute directly to specificity in protein complex formation and provides guidelines for peptidomimetic inhibitor design."
"Mechanisms have been proposed for \xce\xb1-KG-dependent non-heme iron enzyme catalyzed oxygen atom insertion into an olefinic moiety in various natural products, but they have not been examined in detail. Using a combination of methods including transient kinetics, M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that AsqJ-catalyzed (\xe2\x88\x92)-4\xe2\x80\xb2-methoxycyclopenin formation uses a high-spin Fe(IV)-oxo intermediate to carry out epoxidation. Furthermore, product analysis on 16O/18O isotope incorporation from the reactions using the native substrate, 4\xe2\x80\xb2-methoxydehydrocyclopeptin, and a mechanistic probe, dehydrocyclopeptin, reveals evidence supporting oxo\xe2\x86\x94hydroxo tautomerism of the Fe(IV)-oxo species in the non-heme iron enzyme catalysis."
"Fluorescent probes have emerged as an essential tool in the molecular recognition events in biological systems; however, due to the complex structures of certain biomolecules, it remains a challenge to design small-molecule fluorescent probes with high sensitivity and selectivity. Inspired by the enzyme-catalyzed reaction between biomolecule and probe, we present a novel combination-reaction two-step sensing strategy to improve sensitivity and selectivity. Based on this strategy, we successfully prepared a turn-on fluorescent reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) probe, in which boronic acid was introduced to bind with NADH and subsequently accelerate the sensing process. This probe shows remarkably improved sensitivity (detection limit: 0.084 \xce\xbcM) and selectivity to NADH in the absence of any enzymes. In order to improve the practicality, the boronic acid was further modified to change the measurement conditions from alkalescent (pH 9.5) to physiological environment (pH 7.4). Utilizing these probes, we not only accurately quantified the NADH weight in a health care product but also evaluated intracellular NADH levels in live cell imaging. Thus, these bio-inspired fluorescent probes offer excellent tools for elucidating the roles of NADH in biological systems as well as a practical strategy to develop future sensitive and selective probes for complicated biomolecules."
"The rapid development in fluorescence microscopy and imaging techniques has greatly benefited our understanding of the mechanisms governing cellular processes at the molecular level. In particular, super-resolution microscopy methods overcome the diffraction limit to observe nanoscale cellular structures with unprecedented detail, and single-molecule tracking provides precise dynamic information about the motions of labeled proteins and oligonucleotides. Enhanced photostability of fluorescent labels (i.e., maximum emitted photons before photobleaching) is a critical requirement for achieving the ultimate spatio-temporal resolution with either method. While super-resolution imaging has greatly benefited from highly photostable fluorophores, a shortage of photostable fluorescent labels for bacteria has limited its use in these small but relevant organisms. In this study, we report the use of a highly photostable fluoromodule, dL5, to genetically label proteins in the Gram-negative bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, enabling long-time-scale protein tracking and super-resolution microscopy. dL5 imaging relies on the activation of the fluorogen Malachite Green (MG) and can be used to label proteins sparsely, enabling single-protein detection in live bacteria without initial bleaching steps. dL5-MG complexes emit 2-fold more photons before photobleaching compared to organic dyes such as Cy5 and Alexa 647 in vitro, and 5-fold more photons compared to eYFP in vivo. We imaged fusions of dL5 to three different proteins in live Caulobacter cells using stimulated emission depletion microscopy, yielding a 4-fold resolution enhancement compared to diffraction-limited imaging. Importantly, dL5 fusions to an intermediate filament protein CreS are significantly less perturbative compared to traditional fluorescent protein fusions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the use of fluorogen activating proteins for super-resolution imaging in live bacterial cells."
"The determination of reactivity parameters for short-lived intermediates provides an indispensable tool for synthetic design. Despite that electrophilicity parameters have now been established for more than 250 reactive species, the corresponding parameters for benzyne and related intermediates have not been uncovered. We report a study that has allowed for the quantification of benzyne\xe2\x80\x99s electrophilicity parameter. Our approach relies on the strategic use of the diffusion-clock method and also provides electrophilicity parameters E for other substituted arynes."
We report here an enhancement in photovoltage for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) where halogen-bonding interactions exist between a nucleophilic electrolyte species (I\xe2\x80\x93) and a photo-oxidized dye immobilized on a TiO2 surface. The triarylamine-based dyes under investigation showed larger rate constants for dye regeneration (kreg) by the nucleophilic electrolyte species when heavier halogen substituents were positioned on the dye. The open-circuit voltages (VOC) tracked these kreg values. This analysis of a homologous series of dyes that differ only in the identity of two halogen substituents provides compelling evidence that the DSSC photovoltage is sensitive to kreg. This study also provides the first direct evidence that halogen-bonding interactions between the dye and the electrolyte can bolster DSSC performance.
"The mechanochemical activation of cis-gem-difluorocyclopropane (cis-gDFC) mechanophore in toluene was characterized with single-molecule force spectroscopy. Unlike previously reported behavior in methyl benzoate (MB), two transitions are observed in the force vs extension curves of cis-gDFC polymers in toluene. The first transition occurs at the same force of \xe2\x88\xbc1300 pN observed previously in MB, but a second transition is observed at forces of \xe2\x88\xbc1800 pN that reveal the partial formation of the trans-gDFC isomer. The behavior is attributed to competing reactions of the cis-gDFC at the 1300 pN plateau: addition of oxygen to a ring-opened diradicaloid intermediate, and isomerization of cis-gDFC to its trans isomer."
"An efficient kinetic resolution of axially chiral 5- or 8-substituted quinoline derivatives was developed through asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of heteroaromatic moiety, simultaneously obtaining two kinds of axially chiral skeletons with up to 209 of selectivity factor. This represents the first successful application of asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of heteroaromatics in kinetic resolution of axially chiral biaryls."
"FeII4L6 tetrahedral cage 1 undergoes post-assembly modification (PAM) via a Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder cycloaddition of the anthracene panels of the cage with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE). The modified cage 2 possesses an enclosed cavity suitable for encapsulation of the fullerene C60, whereas original cage 1 forms a unique covalent adduct through a Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder cycloaddition of three of its anthracene ligands with C60. This adduct undergoes further PAM via reaction of the remaining three ligands with TCNE, enabling the isolation of two distinct products depending on the order of addition of C60 and TCNE. Modified cage 2 was also able to bind an anionic guest, [Co(C2B9H11)2]\xe2\x88\x92, which was not encapsulated by the original cage, demonstrating the potential of PAM for tuning the binding properties of supramolecular hosts."
"The NHC-stabilized silicon\xe2\x80\x93carbon mixed cumulene (Me3Si)2C\xe2\x95\x90Si(IPr)\xe2\x95\x90Si(IPr)\xe2\x95\x90C(SiMe3)2 (3, IPr = 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethyl-imidazol-2-ylidene) has been prepared by reaction of Ar(SiMe3)NK with the NHC-stabilized silene (Me3Si)2C\xe2\x95\x90Si(SiMe3)Cl(IPr) (2) in toluene at low temperature via the elimination of trimethylsilyl and chloride groups from 2. X-ray crystal analysis of 3 indicated the formal C\xe2\x95\x90Si\xe2\x95\x90Si\xe2\x95\x90C cumulene skeleton with the short Si\xe2\x80\x93Si double bond distance of 2.1896(10) \xc3\x85. DFT calculations disclosed its zwitterionic character. Reaction of 3 with diphenylacetylene resulted in the formation of a silatriafulvene with an exocyclic NHC-stabilized silene moiety."
"The 18-electron shell closure structure of Au nanoclusters protected by thiol ligands has not been reported until now. Herein, we synthesize a novel nanocluster bearing the same gold atom number but a different thiolate number as another structurally resolved nanocluster Au44(TBBT)28 (TBBTH = 4-tert-butylbenzenelthiol). The new cluster was determined to be Au44(2,4-DMBT)26 (2,4-DMBTH = 2,4-dimethylbenzenethiol) using multiple techniques, including mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray crystallography (SCXC). Au44(2,4-DMBT)26 represents the first 18-electron closed-shell gold nanocluster. SCXC reveals that the atomic structure of Au44(2,4-DMBT)26 is completely different from that of Au44(TBBT)28 but is similar to the structure of Au38Q. The arrangement of staples (bridging thiolates) and part of the Au29 kernel atom induces the chirality of Au44(2,4-DMBT)26. The finding that a small portion of the gold kernel exhibits chirality is interesting because it has not been previously reported to the best of our knowledge. Although Au44(2,4-DMBT)26 bears an 18-electron shell closure structure, it is less thermostable than Au44(TBBT)28, indicating that multiple factors contribute to the thermostability of gold nanoclusters. Surprisingly, the small difference in Au/thiolate molar ratio between Au44(2,4-DMBT)26 and Au44(TBBT)28 leads to a dramatic distinction in Au 4f X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, where it is found that the charge state of Au in Au44(2,4-DMBT)26 is remarkably more positive than that in Au44(TBBT)28 and even slightly more positive than the charge states of gold in Au-(2,4-DMBT) or Au-TBBT complexes."
"The cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene stabilized Si2H2 has been isolated in the molecular form of composition (Me-cAAC:)2Si2H2 (1) and (Cy-cAAC:)2Si2H2 (2) at room temperature. Compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized from the reduction of HSiCl3 using 3 equiv of KC8 in the presence of 1 equiv of Me-cAAC: and Cy-cAAC:, respectively. These are the first molecular examples of Si2H2 characterized by single crystal X-ray structural analysis. Moreover, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and 1H as well as 29Si NMR data are reported. Furthermore, the structure of compound 1 has been investigated by theoretical methods. The theoretical analysis of 1 explains equally well its structure with coordinate bonds as with classical double bonds of a 2,3-disila-1,3-butadiene."
"Since the discovery of the first \xe2\x80\x9cinorganic benzene\xe2\x80\x9d (borazine, B3N3H6), the synthesis of other noncarbon derivatives is an ongoing challenge in Inorganic Chemistry. Here we report on the synthesis of the first pnictogen\xe2\x80\x93silicon congeners of benzene, the triarsa- and the triphospha-trisilabenzene [(PhC(NtBu)2)3Si3E3] (E = P (1a), As (1b)) by a simple metathesis reaction. These compounds are formed by the reaction of [Cp\xe2\x80\xb32Zr(\xce\xb71:1-E4)] (E = P, As; Cp\xe2\x80\xb3 = C5H3tBu2) with [PhC(NtBu)2SiCl] in toluene at room temperature along with the silicon pnictogen congeners of the cyclobutadiene, [(PhC(NtBu)2)2Si2E2] (E = P (2a), As (2b)), which is unprecedented for the arsenic system 2b. All compounds were comprehensively characterized, and density functional theory calculations were performed to verify the stability and the aromatic character of the triarsa- and the triphospha-trisilabenzene."
"A groundbreaking discovery in nanofluidics was the observation of the tremendously enhanced water permeability of carbon nanotubes, those iconic objects of nanosciences. The origin of this phenomenon is still a subject of controversy. One of the proposed explanations involves dramatic modifications of the H-bond network of nanoconfined water with respect to that of bulk water. Infrared spectroscopy is an ideal technique to follow modifications of this network through the inter- and intramolecular bonds of water molecules. Here we report the first infrared study of water uptake at controlled vapor pressure in single walled carbon nanotubes with diameters ranging from 0.7 to 2.1 nm. It reveals a predominant contribution of loose H bonds even for fully hydrated states, irrespective of the nanotube size. Our results show that, while the dominating loosely bond signature is attributed to a one-dimensional chain structure for small diameter nanotubes, this feature also results from a water layer with \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d OH (dangling) bonds facing the nanotube wall for larger diameter nanotubes. These experimental findings provide a solid reference for further modeling of water behavior in hydrophobic nanochannels."
"Unexpected etching of nanocrystals, nanorods, and their heterostructures by one of the most commonly used metal precursors, metal oleates, is reported. Zn oleate is shown to etch CdS nanorods anisotropically, where the length decreases without a significant change in the diameter. Sodium oleate enhances the etch rate, whereas oleic acid alone does not cause etching, indicating the importance of the countercation on the rate of oleate induced etching. Subsequent addition of Se precursors to the partially etched nanorods in Zn oleate solution can lead to epitaxial growth of CdSe particles rather than the expected ZnSe growth, despite an excess amount of Zn precursors being present. The composition of this epitaxial growth can be varied from CdSe to ZnSe, depending on the amount of excess oleic acid or the reaction temperature. Similar tuning of composition can be observed when starting with collinear CdSe/CdS/CdSe rod/rod/rod heterostructures and spherical CdS (or CdSe/CdS core/shell) nanocrystals. Conversion of collinear rod/rod/rod structures to barbells and interesting rod growth from nearly spherical particles among other structures can also result due to the initial etching effect of metal oleates. These observations have important implications on our understanding of nanocrystal heterostructure synthesis and open up new routes to varying the composition and morphology of these materials."
"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress are implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, and this feature provides a vital biochemical basis for designing novel therapeutic and diagnostic nanomedicines. Among them, oxidation-responsive micelles and vesicles (polymersomes) of amphiphilic block copolymers have been extensively explored; however, in previous works, oxidation by ROS including H2O2 exclusively leads to microstructural destruction of polymeric assemblies. For oxidation-responsive polymersomes, fast release of encapsulated hydrophilic drugs and bioactive macromolecules will occur upon microstructural disintegration. Under certain application circumstances, this does not meet design requirements for sustained-release drug nanocarriers and long-acting in vivo nanoreactors. Also note that conventional polymersomes possess thick hydrophobic bilayers and compromised membrane permeability, rendering them as ineffective nanocarriers and nanoreactors. We herein report the fabrication of oxidation-responsive multifunctional polymersomes exhibiting intracellular milieu-triggered vesicle bilayer cross-linking, permeability switching, and enhanced imaging/drug release features. Mitochondria-targeted H2O2 reactive polymersomes were obtained through the self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers containing arylboronate ester-capped self-immolative side linkages in the hydrophobic block, followed by surface functionalization with targeting peptides. Upon cellular uptake, intracellular H2O2 triggers cascade decaging reactions and generates primary amine moieties; prominent amidation reaction then occurs within hydrophobic bilayer membranes, resulting in concurrent cross-linking and hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic transition of polymersome bilayers inside live cells. This process was further utilized to achieve integrated functions such as sustained drug release, (combination) chemotherapy monitored by fluorescence and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging turn-on, and to construct intracellular fluorogenic nanoreactors for cytosolic thiol-containing bioactive molecules."
"We present results of ab initio electronic structure and molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD), as well as a microkinetic model of CO oxidation catalyzed by TiO2 supported Au nanocatalysts. A coverage-dependent microkinetic analysis, based on energetics obtained with density functional methods, shows that the dominant kinetic pathway, activated oxygen species, and catalytic active sites are all strongly depended on both temperature and oxygen partial pressure. Under oxidizing conditions and T < 400 K, the prevalent pathway involves a dynamic single atom catalytic mechanism. This reaction is catalyzed by a transient Au\xe2\x80\x94CO species that migrates from the Au-cluster onto a surface oxygen adatom. It subsequently reacts with the TiO2 support via a Mars van Krevelen mechanism to form CO2 and finally the Au atom reintegrates back into the gold cluster to complete the catalytic cycle. At 300 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 600 K, oxygen-bound single Oad\xe2\x80\x94Au+\xe2\x80\x94CO sites and the perimeter Au-sites of the nanoparticle work in tandem to optimally catalyze the reaction. Above 600 K, a variety of alternate pathways associated with both single-atom and the perimeter sites of the Au nanoparticle are found to be active. Under low oxygen pressures, Oad\xe2\x80\x94Au+\xe2\x80\x94CO species can be a source of catalyst deactivation and the dominant pathway involves only Au-perimeter sites. A detailed comparison of the current model and the existing literature resolves many apparent inconsistencies in the mechanistic interpretations."
"In this article, Ser/Thr ligationon/off has been realized to enable N-to-C successive peptide ligations using a salicylaldehyde semicarbazone (SALoff) group by in situ activation with pyruvic acid of the peptide SALoff ester into the peptide salicylaldehyde (SALon) ester. In addition, a peptide with a C-terminal thioester and N-terminal Ser or Thr as the middle peptide segment can undergo one-pot Ser/Thr ligation and native chemical ligation in the N-to-C direction. The utility of this combined ligation strategy in the N-to-C direction has been showcased through the convergent assembly of a human cytokine protein sequence, GlcNAcylated interleukin-25."
"Nitrogen activation by nitrogenase is one of the most important enzymatic processes on earth. In spite of the determination of X-ray structures of increasingly higher resolution, the nitrogenase mechanism is still not understood. In the most recent X-ray structures it has been shown that a carbon resides in the center of the MoFe-cofactor. Its role is not known. Recent spectroscopic studies, mainly EPR, have come closest to obtaining a molecular mechanism for activating nitrogen. Two hydrides have been shown to play a key role in this context. In the present study, the mechanism for nitrogenase has been investigated by hybrid DFT using a cluster model. This approach has been shown to be very successful for predicting mechanisms for other redox-active enzymes, such as the one for photosystem II, but has so far not been used in its most recent form for nitrogenase. The mechanism obtained has large similarities to the one suggested by spectroscopy, with a reductive elimination of two hydrides just before nitrogen binding. However, a very surprising finding is that the central carbon becomes protonated and has to move out of the cavity as a methyl group before the hydrides can be formed. This has not been suggested before."
"Two-dimensional colloidal nanoplatelets (NPLs), owing to the atomic-level control of their confined direction (i.e., no inhomogeneous broadening), have demonstrated improved photoluminescence (PL) line widths for cadmium chalcogenide-based nanocrystals. Here we use cation exchange to synthesize mercury chalcogenide NPLs. Appropriate control of reaction kinetics enables the 2D morphology of the NPLs to be maintained during the cation exchange. HgTe and HgSe NPLs have significantly improved optical features compared to existing materials with similar band gaps. The PL line width of HgTe NPLs (40 nm full width at half-maximum, centered at 880 nm) is a factor of 2 smaller than typical PbS nanocrystals (NCs) emitting at the same wavelength. The PL has a lifetime of 50 ns, almost 2 orders of magnitude shorter than small PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), and a quantum yield of \xe2\x88\xbc10%, almost 2 orders of magnitude shorter than small PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs). These materials are promising for a large variety of applications spanning from telecommunications to the design of colloidal topological insulators."
"Thermo-electrochemical cells have potential to generate thermoelectric voltage 1 order higher than that given by semiconductor materials. To overcome the current issues in thermoelectric energy conversion, it is of paramount importance to grow and fulfill the full potential of thermo-electrochemical cells. Here we report a rational supramolecular methodology that yielded the highest Seebeck coefficient of ca. 2.0 mV K\xe2\x80\x931 around ambient temperatures. This is based on the encapsulation of triiodide ions in \xce\xb1-cyclodextrin, whose equilibrium is shifted to the complexation at lower temperatures, whereas it is inverted at elevated temperatures. This temperature-dependent host\xe2\x80\x93guest interaction provides a concentration gradient of redox ion pairs between two electrodes, leading to the eminent performance of the thermo-electrochemical cells. The figure of merit for this system, zT reached a high value of 5 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x933. The introduction of host\xe2\x80\x93guest chemistry to thermoelectric cells thus provides a new perspective in thermoelectric energy conversion."
