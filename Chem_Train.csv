"Hydrophobic colloidal nanocrystals are typically synthesized and manipulated with commercially available ligands, and surface functionalization is therefore typically limited to a small number of molecules. Here, we report the use of polycatenar ligands derived from polyalkylbenzoates for the direct synthesis of metallic, chalcogenide, pnictide, and oxide nanocrystals. Polycatenar molecules, branched structures bearing diverging chains in which the terminal substitution pattern, functionality, and binding group can be independently modified, offer a modular platform for the development of ligands with targeted properties. Not only are these ligands used for the direct synthesis of monodisperse nanocrystals, but nanocrystals coated with polycatenar ligands self-assemble into softer bcc superlattices that deviate from conventional harder close-packed structures (fcc or hcp) formed by the same nanocrystals coated with commercial ligands. Self-assembly experiments demonstrate that the molecular structure of polycatenar ligands encodes interparticle spacings and attractions, engineering self-assembly, which is tunable from hard sphere to soft sphere behavior."
"Multicomponent coupling reactions (MCRs) are becoming increasingly used in the synthesis of macromolecules, as they can allow the rapid generation of libraries of materials as a method to tune properties. MCRs could prove particularly useful in the synthesis of \xcf\x80-conjugated polymers in which structural changes are necessary for fine-tuning of electronic properties. We describe here the first metal-free multicomponent approach to conjugated polymers. This reaction exploits the coupling of imines, acid chlorides, and (catechyl)PPh to generate phospha-m\xc3\xbcnchnone-containing polymers, which can be converted to poly(pyrroles) via cycloaddition. The platform allows for the efficient synthesis of families of high molecular weight polymers in one step from readily available monomers."
"Non-natural synthetic oligomers that adopt well-defined secondary structures (i.e., foldamers) represent appealing components for the fabrication of bioinspired self-assembled architectures at the nanometer scale. Recently, peptidomimetic N,N\xe2\x80\xb2-linked oligourea helices have been designed de novo with the ability to fold into discrete helix bundles in aqueous conditions. In order to gain better insight into the determinants of oligourea helix bundle formation, we have investigated the sequence-to-structure relationship of an 11-mer oligourea previously shown to assemble into a six-helix bundle. Using circular dichroism, NMR spectroscopy, native mass-spectrometry and X-ray crystallography, we studied how bundle formation was affected by systematic replacement of the hydrophobic surface of the oligourea helix with either polar or different hydrophobic side chains. The molecular information gathered here has revealed several key requirements for foldamer bundle formation in aqueous conditions, and provides valuable insight toward the development of foldamer quaternary assemblies with improved (bio)physical properties and divergent topologies."
"The first example of a transition metal (BB)-carboryne complex containing two boron atoms of the icosahedral cage connected to a single exohedral metal center (POBBOP)Ru(CO)2 (POBBOP = 1,7-OP(i-Pr)2-2,6-dehydro-m-carborane) was synthesized by double B\xe2\x80\x93H activation within the strained m-carboranyl pincer framework. Theoretical calculations revealed that the unique three-membered (BB)>Ru metalacycle is formed by two bent B\xe2\x80\x93Ru \xcf\x83-bonds with the concomitant increase of the bond order between the two metalated boron atoms. The reactivity of the highly strained electron-rich (BB)-carboryne fragment with small molecules was probed by reactions with electrophiles. The carboryne\xe2\x80\x93carboranyl transformations reported herein represent a new mode of cooperative metal\xe2\x80\x93ligand reactivity of boron-based complexes."
"Functional supramolecular systems like carbonyl-bridged triarylamine (CBT) trisamides are known for their long-range energy transport at room temperature. Understanding the complex self-assembly processes of this system allows for control over generated structures using controlled supramolecular polymerization. Here, we present two novel CBT trisamides with (S)- or (R)-chiral side chains which show a two-pathway self-assembly behavior in solution. Depending on the thermal profile during the self-assembly process, two different stable states are obtained under otherwise identical conditions. A kinetically trapped state A is reached upon cooling to 7 \xc2\xb0C, via a proposed isodesmic process. In addition, there is a thermodynamically stable state B at 7 \xc2\xb0C that is induced by first undercooling to \xe2\x88\x925 \xc2\xb0C, via a nucleation-elongation mechanism. In both cases, helical supramolecular aggregates comprising H-aggregated CBTs are formed. Additionally, controlled supramolecular polymerization was achieved by mixing the two different states (A and B) from the same enantiomer, leading to a conversion of the kinetically trapped state to the thermodynamically stable state. This process is highly enantioselective, as no conversion is observed if the two states consist of opposite enantiomers. We thus show the importance and opportunities emerging from understanding the pathway complexity of functional supramolecular systems."
"Under physiological conditions, protein oxidation and misfolding occur with very low probability and on long times scales. Single-molecule techniques provide the ability to distinguish between properly folded and damaged proteins that are otherwise masked in ensemble measurements. However, at physiological conditions these rare events occur with a time constant of several hours, inaccessible to current single-molecule approaches. Here we present a magnetic-tweezers-based technique that allows, for the first time, the study of folding of single proteins during week-long experiments. This technique combines HaloTag anchoring, sub-micrometer positioning of magnets, and an active correction of the focal drift. Using this technique and protein L as a molecular template, we generate a magnet law by correlating the distance between the magnet and the measuring paramagnetic bead with unfolding/folding steps. We demonstrate that, using this magnet law, we can accurately measure the dynamics of proteins over a wide range of forces, with minimal dispersion from bead to bead. We also show that the force calibration remains invariant over week-long experiments applied to the same single proteins. The approach demonstrated in this Article opens new, exciting ways to examine proteins on the \xe2\x80\x9chuman\xe2\x80\x9d time scale and establishes magnetic tweezers as a valuable technique to study low-probability events that occur during protein folding under force."
"Erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular carcinoma (Eph) receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) regulate a variety of dynamic cellular events, including cell protrusion, migration, proliferation, and cell-fate determination. Small-molecule inhibitors of Eph kinases are valuable tools for dissecting the physiological and pathological roles of Eph. However, there is a lack of small-molecule inhibitors that are selective for individual Eph isoforms due to the high homology within the family. Herein, we report the development of the first potent and specific inhibitors of a single Eph isoform, EphB3. Through structural bioinformatic analysis, we identified a cysteine in the hinge region of the EphB3 kinase domain, a feature that is not shared with any other human kinases. We synthesized and characterized a series of electrophilic quinazolines to target this unique, reactive feature in EphB3. Some of the electrophilic quinazolines selectively and potently inhibited EphB3 both in vitro and in cells. Cocrystal structures of EphB3 in complex with two quinazolines confirmed the covalent linkage between the protein and the inhibitors. A \xe2\x80\x9cclickable\xe2\x80\x9d version of an optimized inhibitor was created and employed to verify specific target engagement in the whole proteome and to probe the extent and kinetics of target engagement of existing EphB3 inhibitors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the autophosphorylation of EphB3 within the juxtamembrane region occurs in trans using a specific inhibitor. These exquisitely specific inhibitors will facilitate the dissection of EphB3\xe2\x80\x99s role in various biological processes and disease contribution."
"Poylcyclic tetrahydroxanthones comprise a large class of cytototoxic natural products. No mechanism of action has been described for any member of the family. We report the synthesis of kibdelone C and several simplified analogs. Both enantiomers of kibdeleone C show low nanomolar cytotoxicity toward multiple human cancer cell lines. Moreover, several simplified derivatives with improved chemical stability display higher activity than the natural product itself. In vitro studies rule out interaction with DNA or inhibition of topoisomerase, both of which are common modes of action for polycyclic aromatic compounds. However, celluar studies reveal that kibdelone C and its simplified derivatives disrupt the actin cytoseketon without directly binding actin or affecting its polymerization in vitro."
"Nine bis(tryptophan) derivatives (BTs) and two control compounds were synthesized and tested for antimicrobial activity against two Escherichia coli strains and a Staphylococcus aureus strain. The effects of linker type, shape, and conformational rigidity were manifested in dramatic differences in altering tetracycline potency when coadministered with that antibiotic. A reversal of resistance was observed for an E.\xc2\xa0coli strain having a TetA efflux pump. Survival of mammalian cells was assayed with good result."
"Metallosupramolecular architectures are beginning to be exploited for a range of applications including drug delivery, catalysis, molecular recognition, and sensing. For the most part these achievements have been made with high-symmetry metallosupramolecular architectures composed of just one type of ligand and metal ion. Recently, considerable efforts have been made to generate metallosupramolecular architectures that are made up of multiple different ligands and/or metals ions in order to obtain more complex systems with new properties. Herein we show that the addition of an electron-rich 2-amino-substituted tripyridyl ligand, 2,6-bis(pyridin-3-ylethynyl)pyridine (2A-tripy), to a solution of the [Pd2(tripy)4]4+ cage resulted in the clean generation of a heteroleptic [Pd2(tripy)2(2A-tripy)2]4+ architecture. The formation of the mixed-ligand cage [Pd2(tripy)2(2A-tripy)2]4+ was confirmed using 1H NMR spectroscopy, diffusion-ordered spectroscopy, and rotating-frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Density functional theory calculations suggested the cis isomer was more stable that the trans isomer. Additionally, the calculations indicated that the heteroleptic palladium(II) cages are kinetically metastable intermediates rather than the thermodynamic product of the reaction. Competition experiments supported that finding and showed the cages are long-lived in solution at room temperature. Finally, it was shown that the addition of 2A-tripy to a range of preformed [Pd2(Ltripy)4]4+ cages cleanly generated the mixed-ligand systems. Three other systems displaying different exo and endo functionalities within the cage assembly were generated, suggesting that this method could be applied to synthesize a range of highly functionalized heteroleptic cis-[Pd2(La)2(Lb)2]4+ cages."
"X-ray transient absorption spectroscopy (X-TAS) has been used to study the light-induced hydrogen evolution reaction catalyzed by a tetradentate macrocyclic cobalt complex with the formula [LCoIIICl2]+ (L = macrocyclic ligand), [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photosensitizer, and an equimolar mixture of sodium ascorbate/ascorbic acid electron donor in pure water. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis of a binary mixture of the octahedral Co(III) precatalyst and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ after illumination revealed in situ formation of a Co(II) intermediate with significantly distorted geometry and electron-transfer kinetics of 51 ns. On the other hand, X-TAS experiments of the complete photocatalytic system in the presence of the electron donor showed the formation of a square planar Co(I) intermediate species within a few nanoseconds, followed by its decay in the microsecond time scale. The Co(I) structural assignment is supported by calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). At longer reaction times, we observe the formation of the initial Co(III) species concomitant to the decay of Co(I), thus closing the catalytic cycle. The experimental X-ray absorption spectra of the molecular species formed along the catalytic cycle are modeled using a combination of molecular orbital DFT calculations (DFT-MO) and finite difference method (FDM). These findings allowed us to assign the full mechanistic pathway, followed by the catalyst as well as to determine the rate-limiting step of the process, which consists in the protonation of the Co(I) species. This study provides a complete kinetics scheme for the hydrogen evolution reaction by a cobalt catalyst, revealing unique information for the development of better catalysts for the reductive side of hydrogen fuel cells."
"A mild, general, and functional group tolerant intramolecular hydroalkoxylation and hydroacyloxylation of unactivated olefins using a Co(salen) complex, an N-fluoropyridinium salt, and a disiloxane reagent is described. This reaction was carried out at room temperature and afforded five- and six-membered oxygen heterocyclic compounds, such as cyclic ethers and lactones. The Co complex was optimized for previously rare medium ring formation by hydrofunctionalization of unactivated olefins. The powerful Co catalyst system also enables the deprotective hydroalkoxylation of O-protected alkenyl alcohol and hydroacyloxylation of alkenyl ester to afford cyclic ethers and lactones directly. The substrate scope and mechanistic proof of deprotection were investigated. The experimental evidence supports the concerted transition state of the bond-forming step involving a cationic Co complex."
"Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals offer a unique opportunity to bridge molecular and bulk semiconductor redox phenomena. Here, potentiometric titration is demonstrated as a method for quantifying the Fermi levels and charging potentials of free-standing colloidal n-type ZnO nanocrystals possessing between 0 and 20 conduction-band electrons per nanocrystal, corresponding to carrier densities between 0 and 1.2 \xc3\x97 1020 cm\xe2\x80\x933. Potentiometric titration of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals has not been described previously, and little precedent exists for analogous potentiometric titration of any soluble reductants involving so many electrons. Linear changes in Fermi level vs charge-carrier density are observed for each ensemble of nanocrystals, with slopes that depend on the nanocrystal size. Analysis indicates that the ensemble nanocrystal capacitance is governed by classical surface electrical double layers, showing no evidence of quantum contributions. Systematic shifts in the Fermi level are also observed with specific changes in the identity of the charge-compensating countercation. As a simple and contactless alternative to more common thin-film-based voltammetric techniques, potentiometric titration offers a powerful new approach for quantifying the redox properties of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals."
"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a dimeric membrane protein that regulates key aspects of cellular function. Activation of the EGFR is linked to changes in the conformation of the transmembrane (TM) domain, brought about by changes in interactions of the TM helices of the membrane lipid bilayer. Using an advanced computational approach that combines Coarse-Grained molecular dynamics and well-tempered MetaDynamics (CG-MetaD), we characterize the large-scale motions of the TM helices, simulating multiple association and dissociation events between the helices in membrane, thus leading to a free energy landscape of the dimerization process. The lowest energy state of the TM domain is a right-handed dimer structure in which the TM helices interact through the N-terminal small-X3-small sequence motif. In addition to this state, which is thought to correspond to the active form of the receptor, we have identified further low-energy states that allow us to integrate with a high level of detail a range of previous experimental observations. These conformations may lead to the active state via two possible activation pathways, which involve pivoting and rotational motions of the helices, respectively. Molecular dynamics also reveals correlation between the conformational changes of the TM domains and of the intracellular juxtamembrane domains, paving the way for a comprehensive understanding of EGFR signaling at the cell membrane."
"Understanding the formation mechanism of giant molecular clusters is essential for rational design and synthesis of cluster-based nanomaterials with required morphologies and functionalities. Here, typical synthetic reactions of a 2.9 nm spherical molybdenum oxide cluster, {Mo132} (formula: [MoVI72MoV60O372(CH3COO)30(H2O)72]42\xe2\x80\x93), with systematically varied reaction parameters have been fully explored to determine the morphologies and concentration of products, reduction of metal centers, and chemical environments of the organic ligands. The growth of these clusters shows a typical sigmoid curve, suggesting a general multistep self-assembly mechanism for the formation of giant molecular clusters. The reaction starts with a lag phase period when partial MoVI centers of molybdate precursors are reduced to form {MoV2(acetate)} structures under the coordination effect of the acetate groups. Once the concentration of {MoV2(acetate)} reaches a critical value, it triggers the co-assembly of MoV and MoVI species into the giant clusters."
"A series of ladder-type fused heteroacenes consisting of thiophenes and benzothiophenes were synthesized and functionalized with thiol groups for single-molecule electrical measurements via a scanning tunneling microscopy break-junction method. It was found that this molecular wire system possesses exceptional charge transport properties with weak length dependence. The tunneling decay constant \xce\xb2 was estimated to be 0.088 and 0.047 \xc3\x85\xe2\x80\x931 under 0.1 and 0.5 bias, respectively, which is one of the lowest \xce\xb2 values among other non-metal-containing molecular wires, indicating that a planar ladder structure favors charge transport. Transition voltage spectroscopy showed that the energy barrier decreases as the length of the molecule increases. The general trend of the energy offsets derived from the transition voltage via the Newns\xe2\x80\x93Anderson model agrees well with that of the Fermi/HOMO energy level difference. Nonequilibrium Green\xe2\x80\x99s function/density functional theory was used to further investigate the transport process in these molecular wires."
"Two new tellurium-containing nitrides were grown from reactions in molten calcium and lithium. The compound Ca6Te3N2 crystallizes in space group R3\xcc\x85c (a = 12.000(3)\xc3\x85, c = 13.147(4)\xc3\x85; Z = 6); its structure is an anti-type of rinneite (K3NaFeCl6) and 2H perovskite related oxides such as Sr3Co2O6. The compound Ca6(LixFe1\xe2\x80\x93x)Te2N3 where x \xe2\x89\x88 0.48 forms in space group P42/m (a = 8.718(3)\xc3\x85, c = 6.719(2)\xc3\x85; Z = 2) with a new stuffed anti-type variant of the Tl3BiCl6 structure. Band structure calculations and easily observable red/green dichroic behavior indicate that Ca6Te3N2 is a highly anisotropic direct band gap semiconductor (Eg = 2.5 eV). Ca6(LixFe1\xe2\x80\x93x)Te2N3 features isolated linear N\xe2\x80\x93Fe\xe2\x80\x93N units with iron in the rare Fe1+ state. The magnetic behavior of the iron site was characterized by magnetic susceptibility measurements, which indicate a very high magnetic moment (5.16\xce\xbcB) likely due to a high degree of spin\xe2\x80\x93orbit coupling. Inherent disorder at the Fe/Li mixed site frustrates long-range communication between magnetic centers."
"A comprehensive study into the mechanism of bis(phosphino)pyridine (PNP) cobalt-catalyzed C\xe2\x80\x93H borylation of 2,6-lutidine using B2Pin2 (Pin = pinacolate) has been conducted. The experimentally observed rate law, deuterium kinetic isotope effects, and identification of the catalyst resting state support turnover limiting C\xe2\x80\x93H activation from a fully characterized cobalt(I) boryl intermediate. Monitoring the catalytic reaction as a function of time revealed that borylation of the 4-position of the pincer in the cobalt catalyst was faster than arene borylation. Cyclic voltammetry established the electron withdrawing influence of 4-BPin, which slows the rate of C\xe2\x80\x93H oxidative addition and hence overall catalytic turnover. This mechanistic insight inspired the next generation of 4-substituted PNP cobalt catalysts with electron donating and sterically blocking methyl and pyrrolidinyl substituents that exhibited increased activity for the C\xe2\x80\x93H borylation of unactivated arenes. The rationally designed catalysts promote effective turnover with stoichiometric quantities of arene substrate and B2Pin2. Kinetic studies on the improved catalyst, 4-(H)2BPin, established a change in turnover limiting step from C\xe2\x80\x93H oxidative addition to C\xe2\x80\x93B reductive elimination. The iridium congener of the optimized cobalt catalyst, 6-(H)2BPin, was prepared and crystallographically characterized and proved inactive for C\xe2\x80\x93H borylation, a result of the high kinetic barrier for reductive elimination from octahedral Ir(III) complexes."
"We report the oxidation of cyclic olefins, such as cyclohexene, cyclohexene-d10, and cyclooctene, by mononuclear nonheme manganese(IV)-oxo (MnIVO) and triflic acid (HOTf)-bound MnIVO complexes. In the oxidation of cyclohexene, the MnIVO complexes prefer the C\xe2\x80\x94H bond activation to the C\xe2\x95\x90C double bond epoxidation, whereas the C\xe2\x95\x90C double bond epoxidation becomes a preferred reaction pathway in the cyclohexene oxidation by HOTf-bound MnIVO complexes. In contrast, the oxidation of cyclohexene-d10 and cyclooctene by the MnIVO complexes occurs predominantly via the C\xe2\x95\x90C double bond epoxidation. This conclusion is drawn from the product analysis and kinetic studies of the olefin oxidation reactions, such as the epoxide versus allylic oxidation products, the formation of Mn(II) versus Mn(III) products, and the kinetic analyses. Overall, the experimental results suggest that the energy barrier of the C\xe2\x95\x90C double bond epoxidation is very close to that of the allylic C\xe2\x80\x94H bond activation in the oxidation of cyclic olefins by high-valent metal-oxo complexes. Thus, the preference of the reaction pathways is subject to changes upon small manipulation of the reaction environments, such as the supporting ligands and metal ions in metal-oxo species, the presence of HOTf (i.e., HOTf-bound MnIVO species), and the allylic C\xe2\x80\x94H(D) bond dissociation energies of olefins. This is confirmed by DFT calculations in the oxidation of cyclohexene and cyclooctene, which show multiple pathways with similar rate-limiting energy barriers and depending on the allylic C\xe2\x80\x94H bond dissociation energies. In addition, the possibility of excited state reactivity in the current system is confirmed for epoxidation reactions."
"Despite the numerous experimental and theoretical studies on phosphate monoester hydrolysis, significant questions remain concerning the mechanistic details of these biologically critical reactions. In the present work we construct a linear free energy relationship for phosphate monoester hydrolysis to explore the effect of modulating leaving group pKa on the competition between solvent- and substrate-assisted pathways for the hydrolysis of these compounds. Through detailed comparative electronic-structure studies of methyl phosphate and a series of substituted aryl phosphate monoesters, we demonstrate that the preferred mechanism is dependent on the nature of the leaving group. For good leaving groups, a strong preference is observed for a more dissociative solvent-assisted pathway. However, the energy difference between the two pathways gradually reduces as the leaving group pKa increases and creates mechanistic ambiguity for reactions involving relatively poor alkoxy leaving groups. Our calculations show that the transition-state structures vary smoothly across the range of pKas studied and that the pathways remain discrete mechanistic alternatives. Therefore, while not impossible, a biological catalyst would have to surmount a significantly higher activation barrier to facilitate a substrate-assisted pathway than for the solvent-assisted pathway when phosphate is bonded to good leaving groups. For poor leaving groups, this intrinsic preference disappears."
"We proposed a reductive elimination/oxidative addition (re/oa) mechanism for reduction of N2 to 2NH3 by nitrogenase, based on identification of a freeze-trapped intermediate of the \xce\xb1-70Val\xe2\x86\x92Ile MoFe protein as the Janus intermediate that stores four reducing equivalents on FeMo-co as two [Fe\xe2\x80\x93H\xe2\x80\x93Fe] bridging hydrides (denoted E4(4H)). The mechanism postulates that obligatory re of the hydrides as H2 drives reduction of N2 to a state (denoted E4(2N2H)) with a moiety at the diazene (HN\xe2\x95\x90NH) reduction level bound to the catalytic FeMo-co. EPR/ENDOR/photophysical measurements on wild type (WT) MoFe protein now establish this mechanism. They show that a state freeze-trapped during N2 reduction by WT MoFe is the same Janus intermediate, thereby establishing the \xce\xb1-70Val\xe2\x86\x92Ile intermediate as a reliable guide to mechanism. Monitoring the Janus state in WT MoFe during N2 reduction under mixed-isotope condition, H2O buffer/D2, and the converse, establishes that the bridging hydrides/deuterides do not exchange with solvent during enzymatic turnover, thereby solving longstanding puzzles. Relaxation of E4(2N2H) to the WT resting-state is shown to occur via oa of H2 and release of N2 to form Janus, followed by sequential release of two H2, demonstrating the kinetic reversibility of the re/oa equilibrium. Relative populations of E4(2N2H)/E4(4H) freeze-trapped during WT turnover furthermore show that the reversible re/oa equilibrium between [E4(4H) + N2] and [E4(2N2H) + H2] is \xe2\x88\xbc thermoneutral (\xce\x94reG0 \xe2\x88\xbc \xe2\x88\x922 kcal/mol), whereas, by itself, hydrogenation of N2(g) is highly endergonic. These findings demonstrate that (i) re/oa accounts for the historical Key Constraints on mechanism, (ii) that Janus is central to N2 reduction by WT enzyme, which (iii) indeed occurs via the re/oa mechanism. Thus, emerges a picture of the central mechanistic steps by which nitrogenase carries out one of the most challenging chemical transformations in biology."
"We report a concise total synthesis of dictyodendrin F and the first total syntheses of dictyodendrins H and I in six steps. In these syntheses, aryl ynol ethers were employed as the key building blocks to introduce aryl and heteroaryl rings in the dictyodendrins. This rapid synthesis utilized a novel hetero-[2 + 2]-cycloaddition reaction between two aryl ynol ethers to yield a cyclobutenone ring. The cyclobutenone was sequentially converted into a highly substituted carbazole via a retro-4\xcf\x80/6\xcf\x80-electrocyclization\xe2\x80\x93N-acylation cascade reaction to provide the dictyodendrin core. Consecutive intramolecular oxidative coupling and deprotection gave dictyodendrins F, H, and I."
"A palladium-catalyzed cascade carbonylative spirolactonization of hydroxycyclopropanols has been developed to efficiently synthesize oxaspirolactones common to many complex natural products of important therapeutic value. The mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, broad substrate scope, and scalability of this new method were highlighted in expedient total syntheses of the Turkish tobacco natural products \xce\xb1-levantanolide and \xce\xb1-levantenolide in two and four steps, respectively. The hydroxycyclopropanol substrates are readily available in one step via a Kulinkovich reaction of the corresponding lactones. Mechanistic studies utilizing high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) identified several key intermediates in the catalytic cycle, as well as those related to catalyst decomposition and competitive pathways."
"Owing to the often-similar physical and chemical properties of structural isomers of organic molecules, large efforts have been made to develop efficient strategies to isolate specific isomers. However, facile separation of regioisomeric compounds remains difficult. Here we demonstrate a universal organometallic capsule in which two silver centers are rigidly separated from each other by two tetranuclear [Rh4] pyramidal frustums, which selectively encapsulate a specific isomer from mixtures. Not only is the present heterometallic capsule suitable as a host for the encapsulation of a series of aromatic compounds, but also the receptor shows widely differing specificity for the various isomers. Direct experimental evidence is provided for the selective encapsulation of a series of para (p)-disubstituted benzene derivatives, such as p-xylene, p-dichlorobenzene, p-dibromobenzene, and p-diiodobenzene. The size and shape matching, as well as the Ag\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interactions, are the main forces governing the extent of molecular recognition. The encapsulated guest p-xylene can be released by using the solid\xe2\x80\x93liquid solvent washing strategy, and the other guest molecules are easily liberated by using light stimulus."
"We report a stepwise assembly strategy for the integration of metal\xe2\x80\x93organic cages (MOCs) into block copolymers (BCPs). This approach creates \xe2\x80\x9cblock co-polyMOC\xe2\x80\x9d (BCPMOC) materials whose microscopic structures and mechanical properties are readily tunable by adjusting the size and geometry of the MOCs and the composition of the BCPs. In the first assembly step, BCPs functionalized with a pyridyl ligand on the chain end form star-shaped polymers triggered by metal-coordination-induced MOC assembly. The type of MOC junction employed precisely determines the number of arms for the star polymer. In the second step, microphase separation of the BCP is induced, physically cross-linking the star polymers and producing the desired BCPMOC networks in the bulk or gel state. We demonstrate that large spherical M12L24 MOCs, small paddlewheel M2L4 MOCs, or a mixture of both can be incorporated into BCPMOCs to provide materials with tailored branch functionality, phase separation, microdomain spacing, and mechanical properties. Given the synthetic and functional diversity of MOCs and BCPs, our method should enable access to BCPMOCs for a wide range of applications."
"The study of triplet excited state behavior of nucleic acids and component mononucleotides is hampered by the very small yields produced by direct photolysis. We have used high energy triplet sensitizers to generate these species in high yield, thus facilitating the study of their photophysical and photochemical behavior. Acetone-sensitized triplet formation of all triplet state nucleotides allowed nucleotide triplet\xe2\x88\x92triplet absorption spectra to be measured. Triplet\xe2\x88\x92triplet absorption coefficients were determined using comparative actinometry. Self-quenching of the nucleotide triplet states was found to occur efficiently with rate constants, ksq > 107 M-1 s-1. The interaction of a variety of ketone triplet sensitizers with mononucleotides has been studied as a function of the relative energies of the sensitizer\xe2\x88\x92nucleotide pair. In all cases, the triplet states of the sensitizers were efficiently quenched by the nucleotides, although different reaction mechanisms were observed depending on the reaction pair under study. Acetone, the sensitizer with the highest triplet energy, sensitized all triplet state nucleotides. Sensitizers with triplet energies, ET > 74 kcal mol-1, sensitized TMP and those with ET < 74 kcal mol-1 did not exhibit any triplet sensitization, although an efficient quenching reaction (kq > 108 M-1 s-1) was observed. Where energy transfer did not take place, sensitizers were quenched by electron transfer from the purines. The quantum yield for this process was determined as 0.31 for GMP and 0.09 for AMP. In DNA, triplet energy transfer from the same sensitizers was probed by determining the relative efficiency of pyrimidine dimer formation in pBR322, an exclusively triplet-mediated reaction under sensitized conditions. Our results allow some conclusions to be drawn on triplet properties and intramolecular energy transfer in DNA. Base triplet energy levels appear to be lower in DNA than in the isolated mononucleotides. In any system where ketone triplet states are generated, electron transfer from a purine should be considered as a significant reaction pathway. "
Light-induced cross-linking of helical polymers can yield stable covalent organic nanotubes from readily accessible starting materials.
"Here we report, for the first time, an extensive characterization of an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-modified supported heterogeneous catalyst. The existence of the metal-carbene bond could be proven by 13C-SS-NMR experiments. Furthermore, it could be shown that the modification with NHCs does not structurally change the catalyst itself. The effect of the nature and the loading of the NHC on the activity and selectivity of the heterogeneous catalyst is presented by a hydrogenation study, finally leading to an NHC-enabled tunable heterogeneous catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenation."
"We report a non-destructive biochemical technique, termed \xe2\x80\x9cGlyco-seek\xe2\x80\x9d, for analysis of O-GlcNAcylated proteins. Glyco-seek combines chemoenzymatic labeling, proximity ligation, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect O-GlcNAcylated proteins with ultrahigh sensitivity. Our glycan-specific assay can be paired with traditional proximity ligation assays to simultaneously determine the change in total protein levels. We show that Glyco-seek detects attomoles of glycoproteins of interest from cell lysates, with sensitivity several orders of magnitude higher than that of current techniques. We used the method to directly assay the O-GlcNAcylation status of a low-abundance transcription factor from cell lysates without need for isolation or enrichment."
"Electron transfer processes from semiconductor to molecular catalysts was studied in a model hybrid photocatalytic hydrogen evolution system composed of [Co(III)(dmgH)2PyCl] (CoPy) and CdS under different pH conditions. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies revealed that photocatalytic H2 evolution under high pH conditions (pH 13.5) can only account for the thermodynamically more favorable single-step simultaneous two-electron transfer from photoirradiated CdS to Co(III)Py to produce unavoidable intermediate Co(I)Py, rather than a two-step successive one-electron transfer process. This finding not only provides new insight into the charge transfer processes between semiconductors and molecular catalysts but also opens up a new avenue for the assembly and optimization of semiconductor\xe2\x80\x93molecular catalyst hybrid systems processed through multielectron transfer processes."
"Enzymatic transamination is catalyzed by pyridoxal/pyridoxamine, and it involves remarkable cooperative catalysis of a Lys residue in the transaminase. Inspired by transaminases, we developed a class of axially chiral pyridoxamines 11 bearing a lateral amine arm. The pyridoxamines exhibited high catalytic activity and excellent enantioselectivity in asymmetric transamination of \xce\xb1-keto acids, to give various \xce\xb1-amino acids in 67\xe2\x80\x9399% yields with 83\xe2\x80\x9394% ee\xe2\x80\x99s. The lateral amine arm likely participates in cooperative catalysis as the Lys residue does in biological transamination and has an important impact on the transamination in terms of activity and enantioselectivity."
"We developed a thermoswitchable polymeric photosensitizer (T-PPS) by conjugating PS (Pheophorbide-a, PPb-a) to a temperature-responsive polymer backbone of biocompatible hydroxypropyl cellulose. Self-quenched PS molecules linked in close proximity by \xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93\xcf\x80 stacking in T-PPS were easily transited to an active monomeric state by the temperature-induced phase transition of polymer backbones. The temperature-responsive intermolecular interaction changes of PS molecules in T-PPS were demonstrated in synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering and UV\xe2\x80\x93vis spectrophotometer analysis. The T-PPS allowed switchable activation and synergistically enhanced cancer cell killing effect at the hyperthermia temperature (45 \xc2\xb0C). Our developed T-PPS has the considerable potential not only as a new class of photomedicine in clinics but also as a biosensor based on temperature responsiveness."
"Electro-oxidation of the quinoidal bisdithiazole BT in dichloroethane in the presence of [Bu4N][GaBr4] affords the 1:1 radical ion salt [BT][GaBr4], crystals of which belong to the trigonal space group P3. The packing pattern of the radical cations provides a rare example of an organic kagome basket structure, with S = 1/2 radical ion chains located at the triangular corners of a trihexagonal lattice. Magnetic measurements over a wide temperature range from 30 mK to 300 K suggest strongly frustrated AFM interactions on the scale of J/kb \xe2\x88\xbc 30 K, but reveal no anomalies that would be associated with magnetic order. These observations are discussed in terms of the symmetry allowed magnetic interactions within and between the frustrated layers."
"Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have shown significant potential for indoor and building-integrated photovoltaic applications. Herein we present three new D\xe2\x80\x93A\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93A organic sensitizers, XY1, XY2, and XY3, that exhibit high molar extinction coefficients and a broad absorption range. Molecular modifications of these dyes, featuring a benzothiadiazole (BTZ) auxiliary acceptor, were achieved by introducing a thiophene heterocycle as well as by shifting the position of BTZ on the conjugated bridge. The ensuing high molar absorption coefficients enabled the fabrication of highly efficient thin-film solid-state DSSCs with only 1.3 \xce\xbcm mesoporous TiO2 layer. XY2 with a molar extinction coefficient of 6.66 \xc3\x97 104 M\xe2\x80\x931 cm\xe2\x80\x931 at 578 nm led to the best photovoltaic performance of 7.51%."
"A dual-mode aggregative host:guest indicator displacement sensing system has been created for the detection of trimethylated peptides and determination of histone demethylase activity. The combination of selective recognition of suitably sized trimethylammonium salts and reversible lipophilic aggregation of the host:guest complex provides a unique quenching mechanism that is not only dependent on affinity for sensitivity but the lipophilicity of the indicator. In addition, aggregation can be controlled by the application of chaotropic anions in the mixture, allowing a second level of discrimination between hard lysine groups and softer trimethyllysines."
"Most chelation-assisted aliphatic C\xe2\x80\x93H activation proceeds through a kinetically favored five-membered cyclometalated intermediate. Here, we report the first site-selective alkenylation of \xce\xb4-C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H in the presence of more accessible \xce\xb3-C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H bonds via a kinetically less favored six-membered palladacycle. A wide range of functional groups are tolerated, and the unique protocol can be applied to the synthesis of chiral piperidines. Moreover, mechanistic insights have been conducted to elucidate the origin of the unusual site-selectivity."
"The larger size gold nanoparticles typically adopt a face-centered cubic (fcc) atomic packing, while in the ultrasmall nanoclusters the packing styles of Au atoms are diverse, including fcc, hexagonal close packing (hcp), and body-centered cubic (bcc), depending on the ligand protection. The possible conversion between these packing structures is largely unknown. Herein, we report the growth of a new Au21(S-Adm)15 nanocluster (S-Adm = adamantanethiolate) from Au18(SR)14 (SR = cyclohexylthiol), with the total structure determined by X-ray crystallography. It is discovered that the hcp Au9-core in Au18(SR)14 is transformed to a fcc Au10-core in Au21(S-Adm)15. Combining with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide critical information about the growth mechanism (geometrical and electronic structure) and the origin of fcc-structure formation for the thiolate-protected gold nanoclusters."
"We report that phosphotyrosine\xe2\x80\x93cholesterol conjugates effectively and selectively kill cancer cells, including platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells. The conjugate increases the degree of noncovalent oligomerization upon enzymatic dephosphorylation in aqueous buffer. This enzymatic conversion also results in the assembly of the cholesterol conjugates inside and outside cells and leads to cell death. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the formed assemblies of the conjugates not only interact with actin filaments and microtubules but also affect lipid rafts. As the first report of multifaceted supramolecular assemblies of cholesterol conjugates against cancer cells, this work illustrates the integration of enzyme catalysis and self-assembly of essential biological small molecules on and inside cancer cells as a promising strategy for developing multifunctional therapeutics to treat drug-resistant cancers."
"A ferrocenium boronic acid salt activates allylic alcohols to generate transient carbocations that react with in situ-generated chiral enamines from branched aldehydes. The optimized conditions afford the desired acyclic products embedding a methyl-aryl quaternary carbon center with up to 90% yield and 97:3 enantiomeric ratio, with only water as the byproduct. This noble-metal-free method complements alternative methods that are incompatible with carbon\xe2\x80\x93halogen bonds and other sensitive functional groups."
"\xce\xb1/\xce\xb3-Peptide foldamers containing either \xce\xb34-amino acid residues or ring-constrained \xce\xb3-amino acid residues have been reported to adopt 12-helical secondary structure in nonpolar solvents and in the solid state. These observations have engendered speculation that the seemingly flexible \xce\xb34 residues have a high intrinsic helical propensity and that residue-based preorganization may not significantly stabilize the 12-helical conformation. However, the prior studies were conducted in environments that favor intramolecular H-bond formation. Here, we use 2D-NMR to compare the ability of \xce\xb34 residues and cyclic \xce\xb3 residues to support 12-helix formation in more challenging environments, methanol and water. Both \xce\xb3 residue types support 12-helical folding in methanol, but only the cyclically constrained \xce\xb3 residues promote helicity in water. These results demonstrate the importance of residue-based preorganization strategies for achieving stable folding among short foldamers in aqueous solution."
"World\xe2\x80\x99s smallest screws with helical threads are synthesized via mild etching of Ag nanowires. With detailed characterization, we show that this nanostructure arises not from the transformation of the initial lattice, but the result of a unique etching mode. Three-dimensional printed models are used to illustrate the evolution of etch pits, from which a possible mechanism is postulated."
"We herein report a transition-metal-free cross-coupling between secondary alkyl halides/mesylates and aryl/alkenylboronic acid, providing expedited access to a series of nonchiral/chiral coupling products in moderate to good yields. Stereospecific SN2-type coupling is developed for the first time with alkenylboronic acids as pure nucleophiles, offering an attractive alternative to the stereospecific transition-metal-catalyzed C(sp2)\xe2\x80\x93C(sp3) cross-coupling."
"Peroxynitrite (OONO\xe2\x80\x93) is profoundly implicated in health and disease. The physiological and pathological outcome of OONO\xe2\x80\x93 is related to its local concentration, and hence, a reliable OONO\xe2\x80\x93 assay is highly desired. We have developed a FRET-based small-molecule fluorescent probe (PNCy3Cy5), harnessing the differential reactivity of Cy3 and Cy5 toward OONO\xe2\x80\x93 by fine-tuning. It exhibits high detection sensitivity and yields a ratiometric fluorescent signal. We have exemplified that it can be applied in semiquantitative determination of OONO\xe2\x80\x93 in living cells. Notably, it specifically localizes in mitochondria, where endogenous OONO\xe2\x80\x93 is predominantly generated. Thus, PNCy3Cy5 is a promising molecular tool for peroxynitrite biology."
"Using benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b\xe2\x80\xb2]dithiophene and two matched 5,6-difluorobenzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole-based monomers, we demonstrate that random copolymerization of two electron deficient monomers, alternating with one electron rich monomer, forms a successful approach to synthesize state-of-the-art semiconducting copolymers for organic solar cells. Over a range of compositions, these random copolymers provide impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of about 8.0%, higher than those of their binary parent polymers, and with little batch-to-batch variation. A PCE over 8% could also be achieved when the active layer was deposited from nonhalogenated solvents at room temperature."
"The borrowing hydrogen or hydrogen autotransfer methodology is an elegant and sustainable or green concept to construct carbon\xe2\x80\x93carbon bonds. In this concept, alcohols, which can be obtained from barely used and indigestible biomass, such as lignocellulose, are employed as alkylating reagents. An especially challenging alkylation is that of unactivated esters and amides. Only noble metal catalysts based on iridium and ruthenium have been used to accomplish these reactions. Herein, we report on the first base metal-catalyzed \xce\xb1-alkylation of unactivated amides and esters by alcohols. Cobalt complexes stabilized with pincer ligands, recently developed in our laboratory, catalyze these reactions very efficiently. The precatalysts can be synthesized easily from commercially available starting materials on a multigram scale and are self-activating under the basic reaction conditions. This Co catalyst class is also able to mediate alkylation reactions of both esters and amides. In addition, we apply the methodology to synthesize ketones and to convert alcohols into aldehydes elongated by two carbon atoms."
"Light alkali metal hydridotriphenylborates M[HBPh3] (M = Li, Na, K), characterized as tris{2-(dimethylamino)ethyl}amine (L) complexes [(L)M][HBPh3], act as efficient catalysts for the chemoselective hydroboration of a wide range of aldehydes and ketones using pinacolborane HBpin. The lithium derivative showed a remarkably high TOF of \xe2\x89\xa517 s\xe2\x80\x931. These compounds also catalyze the hydroborative reduction of CO2 to give formoxyborane HCO2Bpin without any over-reduction."
"We report a new photocatalytic protocol for the redox-neutral isomerization of cyclic alcohols to linear ketones via C\xe2\x80\x93C bond scission. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that key alkoxy radical intermediates in this reaction are generated via the direct homolytic activation of alcohol O\xe2\x80\x93H bonds in an unusual intramolecular PCET process, wherein the electron travels to a proximal radical cation in concert with proton transfer to a weak Br\xc3\xb8nsted base. Effective bond strength considerations are shown to accurately forecast the feasibility of alkoxy radical generation with a given oxidant/base pair."
"Chemical modifications of native proteins can facilitate production of supernatural protein functions that are not easily accessible by complementary methods relying on genetic manipulations. However, accomplishing precise control over selectivity while maintaining structural integrity and homogeneity still represents a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a transition metal-free method for tryptophan-selective bioconjugation of proteins that is based on an organoradical and operates under ambient conditions. This method exhibits low levels of cross-reactivity and leaves higher-order structures of the protein and various functional groups therein unaffected. The strategy to target less abundant amino acids contributes to the formation of structurally homogeneous conjugates, which may even be suitable for protein crystallography. The absence of toxic metals and biochemically incompatible conditions allows a rapid functional modulation of native proteins such as antibodies and pathogenic aggregative proteins, and this method may thus easily find therapeutic applications."
"The copper-catalyzed H\xe2\x80\x93F insertion into \xce\xb1-diazocarbonyl compounds is described using potassium fluoride (KF) and hexafluoroisopropanol. Access to complex \xce\xb1-fluorocarbonyl derivatives is achieved under mild conditions, and the method is readily adapted to radiofluorination with [18F]KF. This late-stage strategy provides an attractive route to 18F-labeled biomolecules."
"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is driven by the cholesterol-modified Hh ligand, generated by autoprocessing of Hh precursor protein. Two steps in Hh autoprocessing, N\xe2\x80\x93S acyl shift and transesterification, must be coupled for efficient Hh cholesteroylation and downstream signal transduction. In the present study, we show that a conserved aspartate residue, D46 of the Hh autoprocessing domain, coordinates these two catalytic steps. Mutagenesis demonstrated that D46 suppresses non-native Hh precursor autoprocessing and is indispensable for transesterification with cholesterol. NMR measurements indicated that D46 has a pKa of 5.6, \xe2\x88\xbc2 units above the expected pKa of aspartate, due to a hydrogen-bond between protonated D46 and a catalytic cysteine residue. However, the deprotonated form of D46 side chain is also essential, because a D46N mutation cannot mediate cholesteroylation. On the basis of these data, we propose that the proton shuttling of D46 side chain mechanistically couples the two steps of Hh cholesteroylation."
"The applications of metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs) toward industrial separation, catalysis, sensing, and some sophisticated devices are drastically affected by their intrinsic fragility and poor processability. Unlike organic polymers, MOF crystals are insoluble in any solvents and are usually not thermoplastic, which means traditional solvent- or melting-based processing techniques are not applicable for MOFs. Herein, a continuous phase transformation processing strategy is proposed for fabricating and shaping MOFs into processable fluids, shaped bodies, and even MOF foams that are capable of reversible transformation among these states. Based on this strategy, a cup-shaped Cu-MOF composite and hierarchically porous MOF foam were developed for highly efficient catalytic C\xe2\x80\x93H oxidation (conv. 76% and sele. 93% for cup-shaped Cu-MOF composite and conv. 92% and sele. 97% for porous foam) with ease of recycling and dramatically improved kinetics. Furthermore, various MOF-based foams with low densities (<0.1 g cm\xe2\x80\x933) and high MOF loadings (up to 80 wt %) were obtained via this protocol. Imparted with hierarchically porous structures and fully accessible MOFs uniformly distributed, these foams presented low energy penalty (pressure drop <20 Pa, at 500 mL min\xe2\x80\x931) and showed potential applications as efficient membrane reactors."
"An aryne 1,2,3-trisubstitution with aryl allyl sulfoxides is accomplished, featuring an incorporation of C\xe2\x80\x93S, C\xe2\x80\x93O, and C\xe2\x80\x93C bonds on the consecutive positions of a benzene ring. The reaction condition is mild with broad substrate scope. Preliminary mechanistic study suggests a cascade formal [2 + 2] reaction of aryne with S\xe2\x95\x90O bond, an allyl S \xe2\x86\x92 O migration, and a Claisen rearrangement."
"While glassy materials can be made from virtually every class of liquid (metallic, molecular, covalent, and ionic), to date, formation of glasses in which structural units impart porosity on the nanoscopic level remains undeveloped. In view of the well-established porosity of metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs) and the flexibility of their design, we have sought to combine their formation principles with the general versatility of glassy materials. Although the preparation of glassy MOFs can be achieved by amorphization of crystalline frameworks, transparent glassy MOFs exhibiting permanent porosity accessible to gases are yet to be reported. Here, we present a generalizable chemical strategy for making such MOF glasses by assembly from viscous solutions of metal node and organic strut and subsequent evaporation of a plasticizer\xe2\x80\x93modulator solvent. This process yields glasses with 300 m2/g internal surface area (obtained from N2 adsorption isotherms) and a 2 nm pore\xe2\x80\x93pore separation. On a volumetric basis, this porosity (0.33 cm3/cm3) is 3 times that of the early MOFs (0.11 cm3/cm3 for MOF-2) and within range of the most porous MOFs known (0.60 cm3/cm3 for MOF-5). We believe the porosity originates from a 3D covalent network as evidenced by the disappearance of the glass transition signature as the solvent is removed and the highly cross-linked nanostructure builds up. Our work represents an important step forward in translating the versatility and porosity of MOFs to glassy materials."
"A new class of highly acidic confined imino-imidodiphosphate (iIDP) Br\xc3\xb8nsted acids catalyze the asymmetric Prins cyclization of both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. Diverse functionalized 4-methylenetetrahydropyrans are obtained in good to excellent yields and with good to excellent regio- and enantioselectivities. Our iIDP catalysts provide an efficient and scalable enantioselective approach to various fragrances, including rose oxide and doremox."
"Structural diversity of metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs) has been largely limited to linkers with at most two different types of coordinating groups. MOFs constructed from linkers with three or more nonidentical coordinating groups have not been explored. Here, we report a robust and porous crystalline MOF, Zn3(PBSP)2 or MOF-910, constructed from a novel linker PBSP (phenylyne-1-benzoate, 3-benzosemiquinonate, 5-oxidopyridine) bearing three distinct types of coordinative functionality. The MOF adopts a complex and previously unreported topology termed tto. Our study suggests that simple, symmetric linkers are not a necessity for formation of crystalline extended structures and that new, more complex topologies are attainable with irregular, heterotopic linkers. This work illustrates two principles of reticular chemistry: first, selectivity for helical over straight rod secondary building units (SBUs) is achievable with polyheterotopic linkers, and second, the pitch of the resulting helical SBUs may be fine-tuned based on the metrics of the polyheterotopic linker."
"The denudatine-type diterpenoid alkaloids cochlearenine, N-ethyl-1\xce\xb1-hydroxy-17-veratroyldictyzine, and paniculamine have been synthesized for the first time (25, 26, and 26 steps from 16, respectively). These syntheses take advantage of a common intermediate (8) that we have previously employed in preparing aconitine-type natural products. The syntheses reported herein complete the realization of a unified strategy for the preparation of C20, C19, and C18 diterpenoid alkaloids."
"Nucleic acids are generally regarded as the payload in gene therapy, often requiring a carrier for intracellular delivery. With the recent discovery that spherical nucleic acids enter cells rapidly, we demonstrate that nucleic acids also have the potential to act as a delivery vehicle. Herein, we report an amphiphilic DNA-paclitaxel conjugate, which forms stable micellar nanoparticles in solution. The nucleic acid component acts as both a therapeutic payload for intracellular gene regulation and the delivery vehicle for the drug component. A bioreductively activated, self-immolative disulfide linker is used to tether the drug, allowing free drug to be released upon cell uptake. We found that the DNA-paclitaxel nanostructures enter cells \xe2\x88\xbc100 times faster than free DNA, exhibit increased stability against nuclease, and show nearly identical cytotoxicity as free drug. These nanostructures allow one to access a gene target and a drug target using only the payloads themselves, bypassing the need for a cocarrier system."
"Spinosyn A (1), a complex natural product featuring a unique 5,6,5,12-fused tetracyclic core structure, is the major component of spinosad, an organic insecticide and an FDA-approved agent used worldwide. Herein, we report an efficient total synthesis of (\xe2\x88\x92)-spinosyn A with 15 steps in the longest linear sequence and 23 steps total from readily available compounds 14 and 23. The synthetic approach features several important catalytic transformations including a chiral amine-catalyzed intramolecular Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder reaction to afford 22 in excellent diastereoselectivity, a one-step gold-catalyzed propargylic acetate rearrangement to convert 28 to \xce\xb1-iodoenone 31, an unprecedented palladium-catalyzed carbonylative Heck macrolactonization to form the 5,12-fused macrolactone in one step, and a gold-catalyzed Yu glycosylation to install the challenging \xce\xb2-forosamine. This total synthesis is highly convergent and modular, thus offering opportunities to synthesize spinosyn analogues in order to address the emerging cross-resistance problems."
"The activation of second-generation fluorinated oxazaborolidines by the strong acid triflimide (Tf2NH) in CH2Cl2 solution leads to highly active chiral Lewis acids that are very effective catalysts for (4 + 2) cycloaddition. We report herein that this catalytic activity can be further enhanced by the use of Tf2NH in combination with the biscoordinating Lewis acid TiCl4 or SnCl4 as a coactivator. The effective increase in acidity of an exceedingly strong protic acid is greater for biscoordinating TiCl4 and SnCl4 than for monocoordinating salts, even the strong Lewis acids AlBr3 and BBr3 in CH2Cl2 or CH2Cl2/toluene. The increase in the effective acidity of Tf2NH can be understood in terms of a stabilized cyclic anionic complex of Tf2N\xe2\x80\x93 and TiCl4, which implies a broader utility than that described here. The utility of Tf2NH\xe2\x80\x93TiCl4 activation of fluorinated oxazaborolidines is documented by examples including the first enantioselective (4 + 2) cycloaddition to \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated acid chlorides."
"Synthetic access to water-soluble cavitands and capsules has moved recognition events from organic solvents into aqueous media. Here we report the binding and reactivity of long-chain \xce\xb1,\xcf\x89-diamines (C11 to C18) in cavitand hosts. The containers bind the diamines in folded conformations that bury the hydrocarbon chains and expose the amino groups to the aqueous medium. Their acylation with succinic anhydride results in improved yields of monofunctionalized products. The cavitand-bound amino acid products were cyclized to the corresponding macrocyclic dilactams in D2O using water-soluble carbodiimide. Direct reaction of the folded diamines in the cavitand with activated diesters of succinic acid and glutaric acids resulted in 54\xe2\x80\x9396% yields of the 17- to 25-membered dilactams. These cavitand-chaperoned reactions provided 3- to 10-fold improvements over the yields obtained in bulk solution and offer an alternative to high dilution methods. The cavitand induces unlikely conformations in flexible guests and channels their reactivity along otherwise improbable paths."
"Protein\xe2\x80\x93protein interfaces and architecture are critical to the function of multiprotein complexes. Mass spectrometry-based techniques have emerged as powerful strategies for characterization of protein complexes, particularly for heterogeneous mixtures of structures. In the present study, activation and dissociation of three tetrameric protein complexes (streptavidin, transthyretin, and hemoglobin) in the gas phase was undertaken by 193 nm ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) for the characterization of higher order structure. High pulse energy UVPD resulted in the production of dimers and low charged monomers exhibiting symmetrical charge partitioning among the subunits (the so-called symmetrical dissociation pathways), consistent with the subunit organization of the complexes. In addition, UVPD promoted backbone cleavages of the monomeric subunits, the abundances of which corresponded to the more flexible loop regions of the proteins."
"Tandem mass spectrometry can provide structural information on intact protein assemblies, generating mass fingerprints indicative of the stoichiometry and quaternary arrangement of the subunits. However, in such experiments, collision-induced dissociation yields restricted information due to simultaneous subunit unfolding, charge rearrangement, and subsequent ejection of a highly charged unfolded single subunit. Alternative fragmentation strategies can potentially overcome this and supply a deeper level of structural detail. Here, we implemented ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer optimized for native MS and benchmark its performance to HCD fragmentation using various protein oligomers. We investigated dimeric \xce\xb2-lactoglobulin, dimeric superoxide dismutase, dimeric and tetrameric concanavalin A, and heptameric GroES and Gp31; ranging in molecular weight from 32 to 102 kDa. We find that, for the investigated systems, UVPD produces more symmetric charge partitioning than HCD. While HCD spectra show sporadic fragmentation over the full protein backbone sequence of the subunits with a bias toward fragmenting labile bonds, UVPD spectra provided higher sequence coverage. Taken together, we conclude that UVPD is a strong addition to the toolbox of fragmentation methods for top-down proteomics experiments, especially for native protein assemblies."
"Pretreatment facilitates more complete deconstruction of plant biomass to enable more economic production of lignocellulosic biofuels and byproducts. Various co-solvent pretreatments have demonstrated advantages relative to aqueous-only methods by enhancing lignin removal to allow unfettered access to cellulose. However, there is a limited mechanistic understanding of the interactions between the co-solvents and cellulose that impedes further improvement of such pretreatment methods. Recently, tetrahydrofuran (THF) has been identified as a highly effective co-solvent for the pretreatment and fractionation of biomass. To elucidate the mechanism of the THF\xe2\x80\x93water interactions with cellulose, we pair simulation and experimental data demonstrating that enhanced solubilization of cellulose can be achieved by the THF\xe2\x80\x93water co-solvent system at equivolume mixtures and moderate temperatures (\xe2\x89\xa4445 K). The simulations show that THF and water spontaneously phase separate on the local surface of a cellulose fiber, owing to hydrogen bonding of water molecules with the hydrophilic cellulose faces and stacking of THF molecules on the hydrophobic faces. Furthermore, a single fully solvated cellulose chain is shown to be preferentially bound by water molecules in the THF\xe2\x80\x93water mixture. In light of these findings, co-solvent reactions were performed on microcrystalline cellulose and maple wood to show that THF significantly enhanced cellulose deconstruction and lignocellulose solubilization at simulation conditions, enabling a highly versatile and efficient biomass pretreatment and fractionation method."
"Experiments have suggested that the aqueous electron, e\xe2\x80\x93(aq), may play a significant role in the radiation chemistry of DNA. A recent measurement of the energy (below vacuum level) of the putative \xe2\x80\x9cinterfacial\xe2\x80\x9d hydrated electron at the water/vacuum interface, performed using liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy, has been interpreted to suggest that aqueous electrons at the water/biomolecule interface may possess the appropriate energetics to induce DNA strand breaks, whereas e\xe2\x80\x93(aq) in bulk water lies too far below the vacuum level to induce such reactions. Other such experiments, however, find no evidence of a long-lived feature at low binding energy. We employ a variety of computational strategies to demonstrate that the energetics of the hydrated electron at the surface of neat liquid water are not significantly different from those of e\xe2\x80\x93(aq) in bulk water and as such are incompatible with dissociative electron attachment reactions in DNA. We furthermore suggest that no stable interfacial species may exist at all, consistent with the interpretation of certain surface-sensitive spectroscopy measurements, and that even if a short-lived, metastable species does exist at the vacuum/water interface, it would be extremely difficult to distinguish, experimentally, from e\xe2\x80\x93(aq) in bulk water, using either optical absorption or photoelectron spectroscopy."
"Nanocrystals composed of mixed chemical domains have diverse properties that are driving their integration in next-generation electronics, light sources, and biosensors. However, the precise spatial distribution of elements within these particles is difficult to measure and control, yet profoundly impacts their quality and performance. Here we synthesized a unique series of 42 different quantum dot nanocrystals, composed of two chemical domains (CdS:CdSe), arranged in 7 alloy and (core)shell structural classes. Chemometric analyses of far-field Raman spectra accurately classified their internal structures from their vibrational signatures. These classifications provide direct insight into the elemental arrangement of the alloy as well as an independent prediction of fluorescence quantum yield. This nondestructive, rapid approach can be broadly applied to greatly enhance our capacity to measure, predict and monitor multicomponent nanomaterials for precise tuning of their structures and properties."
"Stabilization of the radical cationic state of a donor molecule by 3-D homoconjugation was probed using a substituted carbon-bridged oligophenylenevinylene backbone (COPV, or 5,5-diarylindeno[2,1-a]indenes). For molecules bearing electron-donating groups as the 5,5-aryl moieties, a one-electron oxidation of the COPV backbone results in delocalization of the cationic charge over the whole molecule with a small reorganization energy. The compounds forming a stable radical cation by 3-D homoconjugation produce a uniform amorphous film and show high short-circuit current, high fill factor, and hence high power-conversion efficiency when used as a hole-transporting layer of an organic\xe2\x80\x93inorganic hybrid lead perovskite solar cell. This material thus shows a performance and stability in air comparable to those obtained with the benchmark material, spiro-MeOTAD."
"Terpenoids are the largest and most structurally diverse family of natural products found in nature, yet their presence in bacteria is underappreciated. The carbon skeletons of terpenoids are generated through carbocation-dependent cyclization cascades catalyzed by terpene synthases (TSs). Type I and type II TSs initiate cyclization via diphosphate ionization and protonation, respectively, and protein structures of both types are known. Most plant diterpene synthases (DTSs) possess three \xce\xb1-helical domains (\xce\xb1\xce\xb2\xce\xb3), which are thought to have arisen from the fusion of discrete, ancestral bacterial type I TSs (\xce\xb1) and type II TSs (\xce\xb2\xce\xb3). Type II DTSs of bacterial origin, of which there are no structurally characterized members, are a missing piece in the structural evolution of TSs. Here, we report the first crystal structure of a type II DTS from bacteria. PtmT2 from Streptomyces platensis CB00739 was verified as an ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase involved in the biosynthesis of platensimycin and platencin. The crystal structure of PtmT2 was solved at a resolution of 1.80 \xc3\x85, and docking studies suggest the catalytically active conformation of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed residues involved in binding the diphosphate moiety of GGPP and identified DxxxxE as a potential Mg2+-binding motif for type II DTSs of bacterial origin. Finally, both the shape and physicochemical properties of the active sites are responsible for determining specific catalytic outcomes of TSs. The structure of PtmT2 fundamentally advances the knowledge of bacterial TSs, their mechanisms, and their role in the evolution of TSs."
"Dynamic covalent reactions are widely used in dynamic combinatorial chemistry. Most of these reactions are run under differing reaction conditions and exhibit cross-reactivity when components of multiple reactions are present in one reaction vessel. Herein, we report the study of four dynamic covalent reactions that react reversibly under identical reaction conditions and do not exhibit any cross-reactivity. Dynamic behavior was shown via 1H NMR based exchange experiments. Computational deconvolution of 1H NMR spectra containing the components for more than one of the orthogonal reactions allowed for a semiquantitative analysis of the complex mixtures formed, showing that the reactions proceed independently of each other. Therefore, it is possible to use all four reactions in one pot in a simultaneous, yet orthogonal fashion. This opens up possibilities for the preprogrammed formation of complex thermodynamic assemblies."
"Electrostatics are central to all aspects of nucleic acid behavior, including their folding, condensation, and binding to other molecules, and the energetics of these processes are profoundly influenced by the ion atmosphere that surrounds nucleic acids. Given the highly complex and dynamic nature of the ion atmosphere, understanding its properties and effects will require synergy between computational modeling and experiment. Prior computational models and experiments suggest that cation occupancy in the ion atmosphere depends on the size of the cation. However, the computational models have not been independently tested, and the experimentally observed effects were small. Here, we evaluate a computational model of ion size effects by experimentally testing a blind prediction made from that model, and we present additional experimental results that extend our understanding of the ion atmosphere. Giambasu et al. developed and implemented a three-dimensional reference interaction site (3D-RISM) model for monovalent cations surrounding DNA and RNA helices, and this model predicts that Na+ would outcompete Cs+ by 1.8\xe2\x80\x932.1-fold; i.e., with Cs+ in 2-fold excess of Na+ the ion atmosphere would contain an equal number of each cation (Nucleic Acids Res. 2015, 43, 8405). However, our ion counting experiments indicate that there is no significant preference for Na+ over Cs+. There is an \xe2\x88\xbc25% preferential occupancy of Li+ over larger cations in the ion atmosphere but, counter to general expectations from existing models, no size dependence for the other alkali metal ions. Further, we followed the folding of the P4\xe2\x80\x93P6 RNA and showed that differences in folding with different alkali metal ions observed at high concentration arise from cation\xe2\x80\x93anion interactions and not cation size effects. Overall, our results provide a critical test of a computational prediction, fundamental information about ion atmosphere properties, and parameters that will aid in the development of next-generation nucleic acid computational models."
"Growing interests have been devoted to the design of polymer acceptors as potential replacement for fullerene derivatives for high-performance all polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). One key factor that is limiting the efficiency of all-PSCs is the low fill factor (FF) (normally <0.65), which is strongly correlated with the mobility and film morphology of polymer:polymer blends. In this work, we find a facile method to modulate the crystallinity of the well-known naphthalene diimide (NDI) based polymer N2200, by replacing a certain amount of bithiophene (2T) units in the N2200 backbone by single thiophene (T) units and synthesizing a series of random polymers PNDI-Tx, where x is the percentage of the single T. The acceptor PNDI-T10 is properly miscible with the low band gap donor polymer PTB7-Th, and the nanostructured blend promotes efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Solvent annealing (SA) enables higher hole and electron mobilities, and further suppresses the bimolecular recombination. As expected, the PTB7-Th:PNDI-T10 solar cells attain a high PCE of 7.6%, which is a 2-fold increase compared to that of PTB7-Th:N2200 solar cells. The FF of 0.71 reaches the highest value among all-PSCs to date. Our work demonstrates a rational design for fine-tuned crystallinity of polymer acceptors, and reveals the high potential of all-PSCs through structure and morphology engineering of semicrystalline polymer:polymer blends."
"Bacterial infection caused by intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacterium, Salmonella, and Brucella, is a burgeoning global health epidemic that necessitates urgent action. However, the therapeutic value of a number of antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, against intracellular pathogenic bacteria is compromised due to their inability to traverse eukaryotic membranes. For this significant problem to be addressed, a cleavable conjugate of the antibiotic kanamycin and a nonmembrane lytic, broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide with efficient mammalian cell penetration, P14LRR, was prepared. This approach allows kanamycin to enter mammalian cells as a conjugate linked via a tether that breaks down in the reducing environment within cells. Potent antimicrobial activity of the P14KanS conjugate was demonstrated in vitro, and this reducible conjugate effectively cleared intracellular pathogenic bacteria within macrophages more potently than that of a conjugate lacking the disulfide moiety. Notably, successful clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within macrophages was observed with the dual antibiotic conjugate, and Salmonella levels were significantly reduced in an in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans model."
"The recently discovered role of the BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2 gene) promoter i-motif DNA in modulation of gene expression via interaction with the ribonucleoprotein hnRNP L-like (hnRNP LL) has prompted a more detailed study of the nature of this protein\xe2\x80\x93DNA interaction. The RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) of hnRNP LL were expressed individually, and both RRM1 and RRM2 were found to bind efficiently to the BCL2 i-motif DNA, as well as being critical for transcriptional activation, whereas RRM3\xe2\x80\x934 bound only weakly to this DNA. Binding was followed by unfolding of the DNA as monitored by changes in the CD spectrum. Mutational analysis of the i-motif DNA revealed that binding involved primarily the lateral loops of the i-motif. The kinetics of binding of the DNA with RRM1 was explored by recording CD spectra at predetermined times following admixture of the protein and DNA. The change in molar ellipticity was readily apparent after 30 s and largely complete within 1 min. A more detailed view of protein\xe2\x80\x93DNA interaction was obtained by introducing the fluorescence donor 6-CNTrp in RRM1 at position 137, and the acceptor 4-aminobenzo[g]quinazoline-2-one (Cf) in lieu of cytidine22 in the i-motif DNA. The course of binding of the two species was monitored by FRET, which reflected a steady increase in energy transfer over a period of several minutes. The FRET signal could be diminished by the further addition of (unlabeled) RRM2, no doubt reflecting competition for binding to the i-motif DNA. These experiments using the individual RRM domains from hnRNP LL confirm the role of this transcription factor in activation of BCL2 transcription via the i-motif in the promoter element."
"We investigate the thermally induced cyclization of 1,2-bis(2-phenylethynyl)benzene on Au(111) using scanning tunneling microscopy and computer simulations. Cyclization of sterically hindered enediynes is known to proceed via two competing mechanisms in solution: a classic C1\xe2\x80\x93C6 (Bergman) or a C1\xe2\x80\x93C5 cyclization pathway. On Au(111), we find that the C1\xe2\x80\x93C5 cyclization is suppressed and that the C1\xe2\x80\x93C6 cyclization yields a highly strained bicyclic olefin whose surface chemistry was hitherto unknown. The C1\xe2\x80\x93C6 product self-assembles into discrete noncovalently bound dimers on the surface. The reaction mechanism and driving forces behind noncovalent association are discussed in light of density functional theory calculations."
"Protein inactivation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x93) is considered to trigger cell death pathways associated with protein dysfunction; however, the detailed mechanisms and direct involvement in photodynamic therapy (PDT) have not been revealed. Herein, we report Ir(III) complexes designed for ROS generation through a rational strategy to investigate protein modifications by ROS. The Ir(III) complexes are effective as PDT agents at low concentrations with low-energy irradiation (\xe2\x89\xa4 1 J cm\xe2\x80\x932) because of the relatively high 1O2 quantum yield (> 0.78), even with two-photon activation. Furthermore, two types of protein modifications (protein oxidation and photo-cross-linking) involved in PDT were characterized by mass spectrometry. These modifications were generated primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, producing a significant effect for cancer cell death. Consequently, we present a plausible biologically applicable PDT modality that utilizes rationally designed photoactivatable Ir(III) complexes."
"CuO is a nonhazardous, earth-abundant material that has exciting potential for use in solar cells, photocatalysis, and other optoelectronic applications. While progress has been made on the characterization of properties and reactivity of CuO, there remains significant controversy on how to control the precise band gap by tuning conditions of synthetic methods. Here, we combine experimental and theoretical methods to address the origin of the wide distribution of reported band gaps for CuO nanosheets. We establish reaction conditions to control the band gap and reactivity via a high-temperature treatment in an oxygen-rich environment. SEM, TEM, XRD, and BET physisorption reveals little to no change in nanostructure, crystal structure, or surface area. In contrast, UV\xe2\x80\x93vis spectroscopy shows a modulation in the material band gap over a range of 330 meV. A similar trend is found in H2 temperature-programmed reduction where peak H2 consumption temperature decreases with treatment. Calculations of the density of states show that increasing the oxygen to copper coverage ratio of the surface accounts for most of the observed changes in the band gap. An oxygen exchange mechanism, supported by 18O2 temperature-programmed oxidation, is proposed to be responsible for changes in the CuO nanosheet oxygen to copper stoichiometry. The changes induced by oxygen depletion/deposition serve to explain discrepancies in the band gap of CuO, as reported in the literature, as well as dramatic differences in catalytic performance."
"The structural and electronic properties of graphene coated on a Cu(111) surface can be strongly influenced by the arrangement of adsorbates at the graphene edges. Oxygen and water intercalation at the graphene edges could lead to oxidation and hydrolysis at the graphene/Cu(111) interface, eventually causing decoupling of graphene from the Cu substrate. However, the reaction pathways for oxygen or water (or both) intercalation at the graphene edges are not well understood at the molecular level. Using ab initio density functional theory calculations, we observed a strong hybridization of \xcf\x80 orbitals at a zigzag edge of a graphene nanoribbon (GNR) on a bare Cu(111) surface, whereas such hybridization was absent for the corresponding armchair edge under otherwise identical conditions. These results indicate that the edge type influences the oxidation chemistry beneath the GNR. Moreover, we demonstrate that the presence of oxygen species, as well as GNR, facilitates the propagation of H2O. The following decoupling mechanisms are discussed: (i) GNRs with armchair edge configurations on Cu(111) can be decoupled via a sequential reaction that involves O2 dissociation followed by H2O intercalation, whereas (ii) GNRs with zigzag edge configurations on Cu(111) can be decoupled by oxygen intercalation."
"Controlling the topology of polymer-modified proteins has attracted growing interest. However, one of the main challenges in this field is the lack of efficient and site-specific methods for installing multiple bioorthogonal functionalities on substrate polymers. We report here an orchestrating strategy that provides easy access to various topological protein\xe2\x80\x93poly(amino acid) (PAA) conjugates in high yields. This method features the in situ installation of two \xe2\x80\x9cchemical handles\xe2\x80\x9d, including a thioester for native chemical ligation and a polyglycine nucleophile for sortase A-mediated ligation, at both ends of substrate PAAs. As a result, neither pre-functionalization of initiator or monomer units, nor post-polymerization modification of the resultant polymers, is necessary. Site-specific topological conjugates, particularly circular conjugates, can be conveniently synthesized under mild conditions from the functionalized PAAs. The biomedical utility of our method is demonstrated by the rapid and efficient generation of several therapeutic interferon-\xce\xb1 conjugates, which exhibit significantly enhanced protease resistance and thermostability. Given the versatility of both PAAs and proteins, the method offers a convenient approach to producing libraries of conjugates for biological applications."
"Organic nanotubes (ONTs) are tubular nanostructures composed of small molecules or macromolecules that have found various applications including ion sensor/channels, gas absorption, and photovoltaics. While most ONTs are constructed by self-assembly processes based on weak noncovalent interactions, this unique property gives rise to the inherent instability of their tubular structures. Herein, we report a simple \xe2\x80\x9chelix-to-tube\xe2\x80\x9d strategy to construct robust, covalent ONTs from easily accessible poly(m-phenylene diethynylene)s (poly-PDEs) possessing chiral amide side chains that can adopt a helical conformation through hydrogen-bonding interactions. The helically folded poly-PDEs subsequently undergo light-induced cross-linking at longitudinally aligned 1,3-butadiyne moieties across the whole helix to form covalent tubes (ONTs) both in solution and solid phases. The structures of poly-PDEs and covalent ONTs were characterized by spectroscopic analyses, diffraction analysis, and microscopic analyses. We envisage that this simple yet powerful \xe2\x80\x9chelix-to-tube\xe2\x80\x9d strategy will generate a range of ONT-based materials by introducing functional moieties into a monomer."
"Progress toward the development of minimally invasive liquid biopsies of disease is being bolstered by breakthroughs in the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA): DNA released from cancer cells into the bloodstream. However, robust, sensitive, and specific methods of detecting this emerging analyte are lacking. ctDNA analysis has unique challenges, since it is imperative to distinguish circulating DNA from normal cells vs mutation-bearing sequences originating from tumors. Here we report the electrochemical detection of mutated ctDNA in samples collected from cancer patients. By developing a strategy relying on the use of DNA clutch probes (DCPs) that render specific sequences of ctDNA accessible, we were able to readout the presence of mutated ctDNA. DCPs prevent reassociation of denatured DNA strands: they make one of the two strands of a dsDNA accessible for hybridization to a probe, and they also deactivate other closely related sequences in solution. DCPs ensure thereby that only mutated sequences associate with chip-based sensors detecting hybridization events. The assay exhibits excellent sensitivity and specificity in the detection of mutated ctDNA: it detects 1 fg/\xce\xbcL of a target mutation in the presence of 100 pg/\xce\xbcL of wild-type DNA, corresponding to detecting mutations at a level of 0.01% relative to wild type. This approach allows accurate analysis of samples collected from lung cancer and melanoma patients. This work represents the first detection of ctDNA without enzymatic amplification."
"The formation of high-valent states is a key factor in making highly active transition-metal-based catalysts of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These high oxidation states will be strongly influenced by the local geometric and electronic structures of the metal ion, which are difficult to study due to spectroscopically active and complex backgrounds, short lifetimes, and limited concentrations. Here, we use a wide range of complementary X-ray spectroscopies coupled to DFT calculations to study Co(III)4O4 cubanes and their first oxidized derivatives, which provide insight into the high-valent Co(IV) centers responsible for the activity of molecular and heterogeneous OER catalysts. The combination of X-ray absorption and 1s3p resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (K\xce\xb2 RIXS) allows Co(IV) to be isolated and studied against a spectroscopically active Co(III) background. Co K- and L-edge X-ray absorption data allow for a detailed characterization of the 3d-manifold of effectively localized Co(IV) centers and provide a direct handle on the t2g-based redox-active molecular orbital. K\xce\xb2 RIXS is also shown to provide a powerful probe of Co(IV), and specific spectral features are sensitive to the degree of oxo-mediated metal\xe2\x80\x93metal coupling across Co4O4. Guided by the data, calculations show that electron\xe2\x80\x93hole delocalization can actually oppose Co(IV) formation. Computational extension of Co4O4 to CoM3O4 structures (M = redox-inactive metal) defines electronic structure contributions to Co(IV) formation. Redox activity is shown to be linearly related to covalency, and M(III) oxo inductive effects on Co(IV) oxo bonding can tune the covalency of high-valent sites over a large range and thereby tune E0 over hundreds of millivolts. Additionally, redox-inactive metal substitution can also switch the ground state and modify metal\xe2\x80\x93metal and antibonding interactions across the cluster."
"Solid-state diffusion is often the primary limitation in the synthesis of crystalline inorganic materials and prevents the potential discovery and isolation of new materials that may not be the most stable with respect to the reaction conditions. Synthetic approaches that circumvent diffusion in solid-state reactions are rare and often allow the formation of metastable products. To this end, we present an in situ study of the solid-state metathesis reactions MCl2 + Na2S2 \xe2\x86\x92 MS2 + 2 NaCl (M = Fe, Co, Ni) using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. Depending on the preparation method of the reaction, either combining the reactants in an air-free environment or grinding homogeneously in air before annealing, the barrier to product formation, and therefore reaction pathway, can be altered. In the air-free reactions, the product formation appears to be diffusion limited, with a number of intermediate phases observed before formation of the MS2 product. However, grinding the reactants in air allows NaCl to form directly without annealing and displaces the corresponding metal and sulfide ions into an amorphous matrix, as confirmed by pair distribution function analysis. Heating this mixture yields direct nucleation of the MS2 phase and avoids all crystalline binary intermediates. Grinding in air also dissipates a large amount of lattice energy via the formation of NaCl, and the crystallization of the metal sulfide is a much less exothermic process. This approach has the potential to allow formation of a range of binary, ternary, or higher-ordered compounds to be synthesized in the bulk, while avoiding the formation of many binary intermediates that may otherwise form in a diffusion-limited reaction."
"Catalytic enantioselective syntheses enable a practical approach to enantioenriched molecules. While most of these syntheses have been accomplished by reaction at the prochiral sp2-hybridized carbon atom, little attention has been paid to enantioselective nucleophilic substitution at the sp3-hybridized carbon atom. In particular, substitution at the chiral sp3-hybridized carbon atom of racemic electrophiles has been rarely exploited. To establish an unprecedented enantioselective substitution reaction of racemic electrophiles, enantioconvergent Nicholas reaction of an alkyne\xe2\x80\x93dicobalt complex derived from racemic propargylic alcohol was developed using a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. In the present enantioconvergent process, both enantiomers of the racemic alcohol were transformed efficiently to a variety of thioethers with high enantioselectivity. The key to achieving success is dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) of enantiomeric cationic intermediates generated via dehydroxylation of the starting racemic alcohol under the influence of the chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. The present fascinating DYKAT involves the efficient racemization of these enantiomeric intermediates and effective resolution of these enantiomers through utilization of the chiral conjugate base of the phosphoric acid."
"Safe operation is crucial for lithium (Li) batteries, and therefore, developing separators with dendrite-detection function is of great scientific and technological interest. However, challenges have been encountered when integrating the function into commercial polyolefin separators. Among all polymer candidates, polyimides (PIs) are prominent due to their good thermal/mechanical stability and electrolyte wettability. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to efficiently synthesize PI separators, let alone integrate additional functions. In this work, a novel yet facile solution synthesis was developed to fabricate a nanoporous PI separator. Specifically, recyclable LiBr was utilized as the template for nanopores creation while the polymer was processed at the intermediate stage. This method proves not only to be a facile synthesis with basic lab facility but also to have promising potential for low-cost industrial production. The as-synthesized PI separator exhibited excellent thermal/mechanical stability and electrolyte wettability, the latter of which further improves the ionic conductivity and thus battery rate capability. Notably, stable full-cell cycling for over 200 cycles with a PI separator was further achieved. Based on this method, the fabrication of an all-integrated PI/Cu/PI bifunctional separator for dendrite detection can be fulfilled. The as-fabricated all-integrated separators prove efficient as early alarms of Li penetration, opening up the opportunity for safer battery design by separator engineering."
"Obtaining three-dimensional (3D) protein and peptide crystals on demand requires a precisely orchestrated hierarchical assembly of biopolymer building blocks. In this work, we disclose a metal-ion-mediated strategy to assemble trimeric coiled-coil peptides in a head-to-tail fashion into linear strands with interstrand interactions. This design led to hexagonal 3D peptide crystal formation within 30 min in the presence of divalent metal ions. The crystal morphology could be controlled by varying the metal ion/peptide ratio, resulting in hexagonal discs to rods. Diffraction studies elucidated the head-to-tail arrangement of the coiled-coil linear strands and their hexagonal, antiparallel packing within the crystal. Unsatisfied ligands at the hexagonal ends of the crystals were harnessed as a powerful means to direct His-tagged fluorophores to distinct locations within the crystals. Overall, the designed hierarchical assembly provides a facile means to obtain 3D peptide crystals and incorporate His-tag-based cargoes and may have potential use in drug delivery and sensor design."
"In the presence of a diarylborinic acid catalyst, glycosyl methanesulfonates engage in regio- and stereoselective couplings with partially protected pyranoside and furanoside acceptors. The methanesulfonate donors are prepared in situ from glycosyl hemiacetals, and are coupled under mild, operationally simple conditions (amine base, organoboron catalyst, room temperature). The borinic acid catalyst not only influences site-selectivity via activation of 1,2- or 1,3-diol motifs, but also has a pronounced effect on the stereochemical outcome: 1,2-trans-linked disaccharides are obtained selectively in the absence of neighboring group participation. Reaction progress kinetic analysis was used to obtain insight into the mechanism of glycosylation, both in the presence of catalyst and in its absence, while rates of interconversion of methanesulfonate anomers were determined by NMR exchange spectroscopy (EXSY). Together, the results suggest that although the uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions give rise to opposite stereochemical outcomes, both proceed by associative mechanisms."
A method is described for capturing multiple DNA sequences at the same time while retaining prior sequence tagging by barcoded beads within individual cells.
"The cleavage of inert C\xe2\x80\x93C bonds is a central challenge in modern chemistry. Multinuclear transition metal complexes would be a desirable alternative because of the synergetic effect of multiple metal centers. In this work, carbon\xe2\x80\x93carbon bond cleavage and rearrangement of benzene by a trinuclear titanium hydride were investigated using density functional theory. The reaction occurs via a novel \xe2\x80\x9ctwo-state reactivity\xe2\x80\x9d mechanism. The important elementary steps consist of hydride transfer, benzene coordination, dehydrogenation, oxidative addition, hydride\xe2\x80\x93proton exchange, and reductive elimination. Most importantly, the ground-state potential energy surface switches from nearly degenerate triplet and antiferromagnetic singlet states to a closed-shell singlet state in the dearomatization of benzene, which effectively decreases the activation barrier. Furthermore, the roles of the transition metal centers and hydrides were clarified."
"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has proven to be an exceptionally powerful tool for studying genetic variation and differences in gene expression profiles between cell populations. However, these population-wide studies are limited by their inability to detect variation between individual cells within a population, inspiring the development of single-cell techniques such as Drop-seq, which add a unique barcode to the mRNA from each cell prior to sequencing. Current Drop-seq technology enables capture, amplification, and barcoding of the entire mRNA transcriptome of individual cells. NGS can then be used to sequence the 3\xe2\x80\xb2-end of each message to build a cell-specific transcriptional landscape. However, current technology does not allow high-throughput capture of information distant from the mRNA poly-A tail. Thus, gene profiling would have much greater utility if beads could be generated having multiple transcript-specific capture sequences. Here we report the use of a reversible chain blocking group to enable synthesis of DNA barcoded beads having capture sequences for the constant domains of the T-cell receptor \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 chain mRNAs. We demonstrate that these beads can be used to capture and pair TCR\xce\xb1 and TCR\xce\xb2 sequences from total T-cell RNA, enabling reverse transcription and PCR amplification of these sequences. This is the first example of capture beads having more than one capture sequence, and we envision that this technology will be of high utility for applications such as pairing the antigen receptor chains that give rise to autoimmune diseases or measuring the ratios of mRNA splice variants in cancer stem cells."
"We show that copper-containing metal\xe2\x80\x93organic nanoparticles (MONPs) are readily synthesized via Cu(II)-mediated intramolecular cross-linking of aspartate-containing polyolefins in water. In situ reduction with sodium ascorbate yields Cu(I)-containing MONPs that serve as highly efficient supramolecular catalysts for alkyne\xe2\x80\x93azide \xe2\x80\x9cclick chemistry\xe2\x80\x9d reactions, yielding the desired 1,4-adducts at low parts per million catalyst levels. The nanoparticles have low toxicity and low metal loadings, making them convenient, green catalysts for alkyne\xe2\x80\x93azide \xe2\x80\x9cclick\xe2\x80\x9d reactions in water. The Cu-MONPs enter cells and perform efficient, biocompatible click chemistry, thus acting as intracellular nanoscale molecular synthesizers."
"Reaction of [Ru(IPr)2(CO)H]BArF4 with ZnEt2 forms the heterobimetallic species [Ru(IPr)2(CO)ZnEt]BArF4 (2), which features an unsupported Ru-Zn bond. 2 reacts with H2 to give [Ru(IPr)2(CO)(\xce\xb72-H2)(H)2ZnEt]BArF4 (3) and [Ru(IPr)2(CO)(H)2ZnEt]BArF4 (4). DFT calculations indicate that H2 activation at 2 proceeds via oxidative cleavage at Ru with concomitant hydride transfer to Zn. 2 can also activate hydridic E-H bonds (E = B, Si), and computed mechanisms for the facile H/H exchange processes observed in 3 and 4 are presented."
"Discovery of layered superconductors such as cuprates and iron-based compounds has unveiled new science and compounds. In these superconductors, quasi-two-dimensional layers including transition metal cations play principal role in the superconductivity via carrier doping by means of aliovalent-ion substitution. Here, we report on a two-dimensional superconductivity at 2 K in ThCr2Si2-type layered oxide Y2O2Bi possessing conducting monatomic Bi2\xe2\x80\x93 square net, possibly associated with an exotic superconductivity. The superconductivity emerges only in excessively oxygen-incorporated Y2O2Bi with expanded inter-net distance, in stark contrast to nonsuperconducting pristine Y2O2Bi reported previously. This result suggests that the element incorporation into hidden interstitial site could be an alternative approach to conventional substitution and intercalation methods for search of novel superconductors."
Understanding the mechanisms of enzymatic hydride transfer with nicotinamide coenzyme biomimetics (NCBs) is critical to enhancing the performance of nicotinamide coenzyme-dependent biocatalysts. Here the temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) for hydride transfer between \xe2\x80\x9cbetter than nature\xe2\x80\x9d NCBs and several ene reductase biocatalysts is used to indicate transfer by quantum mechanical tunneling. A strong correlation between rate constants and temperature dependence of the KIE (\xce\x94\xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7) for H/D transfer implies that faster reactions with NCBs are associated with enhanced donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor distance sampling. Our analysis provides the first mechanistic insight into how NCBs can outperform their natural counterparts and emphasizes the need to optimize donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor distance sampling to obtain high catalytic performance from H-transfer enzymes.
"An Ir/Zn dual catalysis has been developed for the enantio- and diastereodivergent \xce\xb1-allylation of unprotected \xce\xb1-hydroxyketones under mild conditions, in the absence of any additional base. The cooperative action of a chiral iridium complex derived from phosphoramidites and a chiral Zn-ProPhenol complex is most likely responsible for its high reactivity, excellent enantioselectivity (up to >99% ee), and good diastereoselectivity (up to >20:1 dr). All four product stereoisomers could be prepared from the same set of starting materials and under identical conditions by simple selection of appropriate catalyst combinations."
"By using solubility control to crystallize the prenucleation clusters of hydrosol, a family of titanium-oxo clusters possessing the {Ti18O27} core in which the 18 Ti(IV)-ions are uniquely connected with \xce\xbc-oxo ligands into a triple-decked pentagonal prism was obtained. The cluster cores are wrapped by external sulfate and aqua ligands, showing good solubilities and stabilities in a variety of solvents including acetonitrile and water and allowing their solution chemistry being studied by means of electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy, 17O NMR, and vibrational spectroscopy. Furthermore, this study provides new titanium oxide candidates for surface modifications and homogeneous photocatalysis."
"The self-assembly of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, an emerging research area, still remains largely unexplored. The strong interlayer attraction between 2D nanosheets leads to face-to-face stacking rather than edge-to-edge coupling. We demonstrate, for the first time, how one can induce and control an edge-to-edge self-assembly process for 2D nanomaterials. The extremely weak van der Waals coupling and strong anisotropy of ReS2 allow us to realize an oriented self-assembly (OSA) process. The aspect ratio of the resulting ReS2 nanoscrolls can be well controlled. In addition, we perform simulations to further explain and confirm the OSA process, demonstrating its great potential to be expanded as a general edge-to-edge self-assembly process suitable for other 2D nanomaterials."
"Understanding the structural and compositional origins of midgap states in semiconductor nanocrystals is a longstanding challenge in nanoscience. Here, we report a broad variety of reagents useful for photochemical reduction of colloidal CdSe quantum dots, and we establish that these reactions proceed via a dark surface prereduction step prior to photoexcitation. Mechanistic studies relying on the specific properties of various reductants lead to the proposal that this surface prereduction occurs at oxidized surface selenium sites. These results demonstrate the use of small-molecule inorganic chemistries to control the physical properties of colloidal QDs and provide microscopic insights into the identities and reactivities of their localized surface species."
"We report measurements of electron transfer rates for four isoenergetic donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor pairs comprising a molecular electron acceptor, methylviologen (MV), and morphology-controlled colloidal semiconductor nanoparticles of CdSe. The four nanoparticles include a spherical quantum dot (QD) and three differing lateral areas of 4-monolayer-thick nanoplatelets (NPLs), each with a 2.42 eV energy gap. As such, the measurements, performed via ultrafast photoluminescence, relate the dependence of charge transfer rate on the spatial extent of the initial electron\xe2\x80\x93hole pair wave function explicitly, which we show for the first time to be related to surface area in this regime that is intermediate between homogeneous and heterogeneous charge transfer as well as 2D to 0D electron transfer. The observed nonlinear dependence of rate with surface area is attributed to exciton delocalization within each structure, which we show via temperature-dependent absorption measurements remains constant."
"The helical handedness in achiral self-assemblies is mostly complex due to spontaneous symmetry breaking or kinetically controlled random assembly formation. Here an attempt has been made to address this issue through chiral anion exchange. A new class of cationic achiral C3-symmetric gelator devoid of any conventional gelation assisting functional units is found to form both right- and left-handed helical structures. A chiral counteranion exchange-assisted approach is successfully introduced to control the chirality sign and thereby to obtain preferred homochiral assemblies. Formation of anion-assisted chiral assembly was confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, microscopic images, and crystal structure. The X-ray crystal structure reveals the construction of helical assemblies with opposite handedness for (+)- and (\xe2\x88\x92)-chiral anion reformed gelators. The appropriate counteranion driven ion-pair-assisted hydrogen-bonding interactions are found responsible for the helical bias control in this C3-symmetric gelator."
"Polycarbonates were successfully synthesized for the first time through the anionic copolymerization of epoxides with CO2, under metal-free conditions. Using an approach based on the activation of epoxides by Lewis acids and of CO2 by appropriate cations, well-defined alternating copolymers made of CO2 and propylene oxide (PO) or cyclohexene oxide (CHO) were indeed obtained. Triethyl borane was the Lewis acid chosen to activate the epoxides, and onium halides or onium alkoxides involving either ammonium, phosphonium, or phosphazenium cations were selected to initiate the copolymerization. In the case of PO, the carbonate content of the poly(propylene carbonate) formed was in the range of 92\xe2\x80\x9399% and turnover numbers (TON) were close to 500; in the case of CHO perfectly alternating poly(cyclohexene carbonate) were obtained and TON values were close to 4000. The advantages of such a copolymerization system are manifold: (i) no need for multistep catalyst/ligand synthesis as in previous works; (ii) no transition metal involved in the copolymer synthesis and therefore no coloration of the samples isolated; and (iii) no necessity for postsynthesis purification."
The manipulation of distortions in perovskite structures is critical to tailoring the properties of these materials for a variety of applications. Here we demonstrate a violation of established octahedral tilt rules in the double perovskite analogue (NH4)2SrFe(CN)6\xc2\xb72H2O. The forbidden tilt pattern we observe arises through coupling to hydration-driven Jahn\xe2\x80\x93Teller-like distortions of the Sr coordination environment. Access to novel distortion mechanisms and the ability to switch these distortions on and off through chemical modification fundamentally expands the toolbox of techniques available for engineering symmetry-breaking processes in solid materials.
"Methanobactins (Mbns) are a growing family of ribosomally produced, post-translationally modified natural products. Characteristic nitrogen-containing heterocycles and neighboring thioamides allow these compounds to bind copper with high affinity. Genome mining has enabled the identification of Mbn operons in bacterial genomes and the prediction of diverse Mbn structures from operon content and precursor peptide sequence. Here we report the characterization of Mbn from Methylosinus (Ms.) species (sp.) LW4. The peptide backbone is distinct from all previously characterized Mbns, and the post-translational modifications correspond precisely to those predicted on the basis of the Ms. sp. LW4 Mbn operon. Thus, prediction based on genome analysis combined with isolation and structural characterization represents a phylogenetic approach to finding diverse Mbns and elucidating their biosynthetic pathways."
"Employing cellular environment for the self-assembly of supramolecular nanofibers for biological applications has been widely explored. But using one precursor to differentiate the extra- and intracellular environments to self-assemble into two different nanofibers remains challenging. With the knowledge that the extracellualr environment of some cancer cells contains large amounts of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) while their intracellular environment is glutathione (GSH)-abundant in mind, we rationally designed a precursor Cys(SEt)-Glu-Tyr(H2PO3)-Phe-Phe-Gly-CBT (1) that can efficiently yield amphiphilic 2 and 2-D to self-assemble into two different nanofibers in hydrogels under the sequential treatment of ALP and GSH. We envision that, by employing a click condensation reaction, this work offers a platform for facilely postmodulation of supramolecular nanofibers, and the versatile precursor 1 could be used to kill two birds with one stone."
"Cross-couplings of alkyl halides and organometallic species based on single electron transfer using Ni and Fe catalyst systems have been studied extensively, and separately, for decades. Here we demonstrate the first couplings of redox-active esters (both isolated and derived in situ from carboxylic acids) with organozinc and organomagnesium species using an Fe-based catalyst system originally developed for alkyl halides. This work is placed in context by showing a direct comparison with a Ni catalyst for >40 examples spanning a range of primary, secondary, and tertiary substrates. This new C\xe2\x80\x93C coupling is scalable and sustainable, and it exhibits a number of clear advantages in several cases over its Ni-based counterpart."
"A two-step heteronuclear enhancement approach was combined with chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) to magnify 15N MRI signal of molecules through indirect detection via water protons. Previous CEST studies have been limited to radiofrequency (rf) saturation transfer or excitation transfer employing protons. Here, the signal of 15N is detected indirectly through the water signal by first inverting selectively protons that are scalar-coupled to 15N in the urea molecule, followed by chemical exchange of the amide proton to bulk water. In addition to providing a small sensitivity enhancement, this approach can be used to monitor the exchange rates and thus the pH sensitivity of the participating 15N-bound protons."
"Using a scanning tunneling microscope, we measured high-bias conductance of single polyporphyrin molecular wires with lengths from 1.3 to 13 nm. We observed several remarkable transport characteristics, including multiple sharp conductance peaks, conductances as high as 20 nS in wires with lengths of >10 nm, and nearly length-independent conductance (attenuation <0.001 \xc3\x85\xe2\x80\x931). We carried out first-principles simulations on myriad metal\xe2\x80\x93molecule\xe2\x80\x93metal junctions. The simulations revealed that the measured conductance is coherent resonant transport via a delocalized molecular orbital."
The century-old yet synthetically underexplored anthracene photodimerization\xe2\x80\x93cycloreversion reactions have been employed as the key steps to access highly strained aromatic hydrocarbons. Herein we report the chemical syntheses of oligoparaphenylene-derived nanohoops in five steps or less featuring a rigid dianthracene synthon. The newly synthesized nanohoops display intriguing experimental and computational properties.
"A gram-scale enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-peganumine A was accomplished in 7 steps from commercially available 6-methoxytryptamine. Key steps included (a) a Liebeskind\xe2\x80\x93Srogl cross-coupling; (b) a one-pot construction of the tetracyclic skeleton from an \xcf\x89-isocyano-\xce\xb3-oxo-aldehyde via a sequence of an unprecedented C\xe2\x80\x93C bond forming lactamization and a transannular condensation; (c) a one-pot organocatalytic process merging two achiral building blocks into an octacyclic structure via a sequence of enantioselective Pictet\xe2\x80\x93Spengler reaction followed by a transannular cyclization. This last reaction created two spirocycles and a 2,7-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one unit with excellent control of both the absolute and relative stereochemistry of the two newly created quaternary stereocenters."
"How to modulate supramolecular protein nanotubes without sacrificing their thermodynamic stability? This challenging issue emerged with an enhanced reality since our successful development of a protein nanotube of chaperonin GroELMC as a novel ATP-responsive 1D nanocarrier because the nanotube length may potentially affect the cellular uptake efficiency. Herein, we report a molecularly engineered protein end-capper (SRMC) that firmly binds to the nanotube termini since the end-capper originates from GroEL. According to the single-ring mutation of GroEL, we obtained a single-ring version of GroEL bearing cysteine mutations (GroELCys) and modified its 14 apical cysteine residues with merocyanine (MC). Whereas SRMC self-dimerizes upon treatment with Mg2+, we confirmed that SRMC serves as the efficient end-capper for the Mg2+-mediated supramolecular polymerization of GroELMC and allows for modulating the average nanotube length over a wide range from 320 to 40 nm by increasing the feed molar ratio SRMC/GroELMC up to 5.4. We also found that the nanotubes shorter than 100 nm are efficiently taken up into HEP3B cells."
The sensitivity provided by fluorescence microscopy enabled the observation of surface intermediates in the synthesis of soluble organozinc reagents by direct insertion of alkyl iodides to commercial zinc powder. Five hypotheses were examined for the mechanistic role of lithium chloride in enabling this direct insertion. The data are consistent with lithium chloride solubilizing organozinc reagents from the surface of the zinc after oxidative addition.
"The electrochemical characterization of brush polymer ion gels containing embedded small-molecule redox-active species is reported. Gels comprising PS\xe2\x80\x93PEO\xe2\x80\x93PS triblock brush polymer, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMIm-TFSI), and some combination of ferrocene (Fc), cobaltocenium (CoCp2+), and Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl (1) exhibit diffusion-controlled redox processes with diffusion coefficients approximately one-fifth of those observed in neat BMIm-TFSI. Notably, 1 dissolves homogeneously in the interpenetrating matrix domain of the ion gel and displays electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO in the gel. The catalytic wave exhibits a positive shift versus Fc+/0 compared with analogous nonaqueous solvents with a reduction potential 450 mV positive of onset and 90% Faradaic efficiency for CO production. These materials provide a promising and alternative approach to immobilized electrocatalysis, creating numerous opportunities for application in solid-state devices."
"Understanding Criegee chemistry has become one of central topics in atmospheric research recently. The reaction of Criegee intermediates with gas-phase water clusters has been widely viewed as a key Criegee reaction in the troposphere. However, the effect of aerosols or clouds on Criegee chemistry has received little attention. In this work, we have investigated the reaction between the smallest Criegee intermediate, CH2OO, and water clusters in the gas phase, as well as at the air/water surface using ab initio quantum chemical calculations and adaptive buffered force quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) dynamics simulations. Our simulation results show that the typical time scale for the reaction of CH2OO with water at the air/water interface is on the order of a few picoseconds, 2\xe2\x80\x933 orders of magnitude shorter than that in the gas phase. Importantly, the adbf-QM/MM dynamics simulations suggest several reaction pathways for the CH2OO + water reaction at the air/water interface, including the loop-structure-mediated mechanism and the stepwise mechanism. Contrary to the conventional gas-phase CH2OO reaction, the loop-structure is not a prerequisite for the stepwise mechanism. For the latter, a water molecule and the CH2OO at the air/water interface, upon their interaction, can result in the formation of (H3O)+ and (OH)CH2(OO)\xe2\x88\x92. Thereafter, a hydrogen bond can be formed between (H3O)+ and the terminal oxygen atom of (OH)CH2(OO)\xe2\x88\x92, leading to direct proton transfer and the formation of \xce\xb1-hydroxy methylperoxide, HOCH2OOH. The mechanistic insights obtained from this simulation study should motivate future experimental studies of the effect of water clouds on Criegee chemistry."
"Mapping the conformational landscape of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and in particular how this landscape is modulated by the membrane environment, is required to gain a clear picture of how signaling proceeds. To this end, we have developed an original strategy based on solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance combined with an efficient isotope labeling scheme. This strategy was applied to a typical GPCR, the leukotriene B4 receptor BLT2, reconstituted in a lipid bilayer. Because of this, we are able to provide direct evidence that BLT2 explores a complex landscape that includes four different conformational states for the unliganded receptor. The relative distribution of the different states is modulated by ligands and the sterol content of the membrane, in parallel with the changes in the ability of the receptor to activate its cognate G protein. This demonstrates a conformational coupling between the agonist and the membrane environment that is likely to be fundamental for GPCR signaling."
"Indole alkaloids are a diverse class of natural products known for their wide range of biological activities and complex chemical structures. Rarely observed in this class are indolic nitrones, such as avrainvillamide and waikialoid, which possess potent bioactivities. Herein the oxa gene cluster from the marine-derived fungus Penicillium oxalicum F30 is described along with the characterization of OxaD, a flavin-dependent oxidase that generates roquefortine L, a nitrone-bearing intermediate in the biosynthesis of oxaline. Nitrone functionality in roquefortine L was confirmed by spectroscopic methods and 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with methyl acrylate. OxaD is a versatile biocatalyst that converts an array of semisynthetic roquefortine C derivatives bearing indoline systems to their respective nitrones. This work describes the first implementation of a nitrone synthase as a biocatalyst and establishes a novel platform for late-stage diversification of a range of complex natural products."
"Formation of N\xe2\x80\x93H and N\xe2\x80\x93C bonds from functionalization of N2 is a potential route to utilization of this abundant resource. One of the key challenges is to make the products of N2 activation reactive enough to undergo further reactions under mild conditions. This paper explores the strategy of \xe2\x80\x9calkali control,\xe2\x80\x9d where the presence of an alkali metal cation enables the reduction of N2 under mild conditions, and then chelation of the alkali metal cation uncovers a highly reactive species that can break benzylic C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds to give new N\xe2\x80\x93H and Fe\xe2\x80\x93C bonds. The ability to \xe2\x80\x9cturn on\xe2\x80\x9d this C\xe2\x80\x93H activation pathway with 18-crown-6 is demonstrated with three different N2 reduction products of N2 cleavage in an iron\xe2\x80\x93potassium system. The alkali control strategy can also turn on an intermolecular reaction of an N2-derived nitride with methyl tosylate that gives a new N\xe2\x80\x93C bond. Since the transient K+-free intermediate reacts with this electrophile but not with the weak C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene, it is proposed that the C\xe2\x80\x93H cleavage occurs by a deprotonation mechanism. The combined results demonstrate that a K+ ion can mask the latent nucleophilicity of N2-derived nitride and imide ligands within a trimetallic iron system and points a way toward control over N2 functionalization."
"One of the main challenges of all-solid-state Li-ion batteries is the restricted power density due to the poor Li-ion transport between the electrodes via the electrolyte. However, to establish what diffusional process is the bottleneck for Li-ion transport requires the ability to distinguish the various processes. The present work investigates the Li-ion diffusion in argyrodite Li6PS5Cl, a promising electrolyte based on its high Li-ion conductivity, using a combination of 7Li NMR experiments and DFT based molecular dynamics simulations. This allows us to distinguish the local Li-ion mobility from the long-range Li-ion motional process, quantifying both and giving a coherent and consistent picture of the bulk diffusion in Li6PS5Cl. NMR exchange experiments are used to unambiguously characterize Li-ion transport over the solid electrolyte\xe2\x80\x93electrode interface for the electrolyte\xe2\x80\x93electrode combination Li6PS5Cl\xe2\x80\x93Li2S, giving unprecedented and direct quantitative insight into the impact of the interface on Li-ion charge transport in all-solid-state batteries. The limited Li-ion transport over the Li6PS5Cl\xe2\x80\x93Li2S interface, orders of magnitude smaller compared with that in the bulk Li6PS5Cl, appears to be the bottleneck for the performance of the Li6PS5Cl\xe2\x80\x93Li2S battery, quantifying one of the major challenges toward improved performance of all-solid-state batteries."
"Understanding fundamental behavior of luminescent nanomaterials upon photoexcitation is necessary to expand photocatalytic and biological imaging applications. Despite the significant amount of experimental work into the luminescence of Au25(SR)18\xe2\x80\x93 clusters, the origin of photoluminescence in these clusters still remains unclear. In this study, the geometric and electronic structural changes of the Au25(SR)18\xe2\x80\x93 (R = H, CH3, CH2CH3, CH2CH2CH3) nanoclusters upon photoexcitation are discussed using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods. Geometric relaxations in the optimized excited states of up to 0.33 \xc3\x85 impart remarkable effects on the energy levels of the frontier orbitals of Au25(SR)18\xe2\x80\x93 nanoclusters. This gives rise to a Stokes shift of 0.49 eV for Au25(SH)18\xe2\x80\x93 in agreement with experiments. Even larger Stokes shifts are predicted for longer ligands. Vibrational frequencies in the 75\xe2\x80\x9380 cm\xe2\x80\x931 range are calculated for the nuclear motion involved in the excited-state nuclear relaxation; this value is in excellent agreement with vibrational beating observed in time-resolved spectroscopy experiments. Several excited states around 0.8, 1.15, and 1.25 eV are calculated for the Au25(SH)18\xe2\x80\x93 nanocluster. Considering the typical underestimation of DFT excitation energies, these states are likely responsible for the emission observed experimentally in the 1.15\xe2\x80\x931.55 eV range. All excited states arise from core-based orbitals; charge-transfer states or other \xe2\x80\x9csemi-ring\xe2\x80\x9d or ligand-based states are not implicated."
"Conventional intercalation cathodes for lithium batteries store charge in redox reactions associated with the transition metal cations, e.g., Mn3+/4+ in LiMn2O4, and this limits the energy storage of Li-ion batteries. Compounds such as Li[Li0.2Ni0.2Mn0.6]O2 exhibit a capacity to store charge in excess of the transition metal redox reactions. The additional capacity occurs at and above 4.5 V versus Li+/Li. The capacity at 4.5 V is dominated by oxidation of the O2\xe2\x80\x93 anions accounting for \xe2\x88\xbc0.43 e\xe2\x80\x93/formula unit, with an additional 0.06 e\xe2\x80\x93/formula unit being associated with O loss from the lattice. In contrast, the capacity above 4.5 V is mainly O loss, \xe2\x88\xbc0.08 e\xe2\x80\x93/formula. The O redox reaction involves the formation of localized hole states on O during charge, which are located on O coordinated by (Mn4+/Li+). The results have been obtained by combining operando electrochemical mass spec on 18O labeled Li[Li0.2Ni0.2Mn0.6]O2 with XANES, soft X-ray spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Finally the general features of O redox are described with discussion about the role of comparatively ionic (less covalent) 3d metal\xe2\x80\x93oxygen interaction on anion redox in lithium rich cathode materials."
"Advanced large-scale electrochemical energy storage requires cost-effective battery systems with high energy densities. Aprotic sodium-oxygen (Na-O2) batteries offer advantages, being comprised of low-cost elements and possessing much lower charge overpotential and higher reversibility compared to their lithium-oxygen battery cousins. Although such differences have been explained by solution-mediated superoxide transport, the underlying nature of this mechanism is not fully understood. Water has been suggested to solubilize superoxide via formation of hydroperoxyl (HO2), but direct evidence of these HO2 radical species in cells has proven elusive. Here, we use ESR spectroscopy at 210 K to identify and quantify soluble HO2 radicals in the electrolyte\xe2\x80\x94cold-trapped in situ to prolong their lifetime\xe2\x80\x94in a Na-O2 cell. These investigations are coupled to parallel SEM studies that image crystalline sodium superoxide (NaO2) on the carbon cathode. The superoxide radicals were spin-trapped via reaction with 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide at different electrochemical stages, allowing monitoring of their production and consumption during cycling. Our results conclusively demonstrate that transport of superoxide from cathode to electrolyte leads to the nucleation and growth of NaO2, which follows classical mechanisms based on the variation of superoxide content in the electrolyte and its correlation with the crystallization of cubic NaO2. The changes in superoxide content upon charge show that charge proceeds through the reverse solution process. Furthermore, we identify the carbon-centered/oxygen-centered alkyl radicals arising from attack of these solubilized HO2 species on the diglyme solvent. This is the first direct evidence of such species, which are likely responsible for electrolyte degradation."
"It is well-known that Ru-based Grubbs catalysts undergo a highly selective \xce\xb1-addition to alkynes to promote exo-cyclization during ring-closing enyne metathesis (RCEYM) or to produce conjugated polyenes containing five-membered rings during the cyclopolymerization (CP) of 1,6-heptadiynes. There are a few reports of \xce\xb2-selective addition to alkynes using Schrock catalysts based on Mo but none for readily accessible and easy-to-use Ru-based catalysts. We report the first example of \xce\xb2-selective addition to alkynes using Grubbs Z-selective catalyst, which produces only endo products during the RCEYM reaction of terminal enynes and promotes the CP of 1,6-heptadiyne derivatives to give conjugated polyenes containing a six-membered ring as a major repeat unit. This unique preference for \xce\xb2-selectivity originated from the side-bound approach of alkynes to the catalyst, where the steric hindrance between the chelating N-heterocyclic carbene ligand of the catalyst and the alkynes disfavored \xce\xb1-addition. To enhance the \xce\xb2-selectivity for CP further, one could increase the size of the substrates on the monomers and lower the reaction temperature to obtain conjugated polyenes containing up to 95% six-membered rings. Moreover, the physical properties of the resulting polymer were analyzed in detail and compared with those of the conjugated polyenes containing only five-membered rings prepared from the same monomer but with a conventional Grubbs catalyst."
"In the search for long-lived quantum coherence in spin systems, vanadium(IV) complexes have shown record phase memory times among molecular systems. When nuclear spin-free ligands are employed, vanadium(IV) complexes can show at low temperature sufficiently long quantum coherence times, Tm, to perform quantum operations, but their use in real devices operating at room temperature is still hampered by the rapid decrease of T1 caused by the efficient spin\xe2\x80\x93phonon coupling. In this work we have investigated the effect of different coordination environments on the magnetization dynamics and the quantum coherence of two vanadium(IV)-based potential molecular spin qubits in the solid state by introducing a unique structural difference, i.e., an oxovanadium(IV) in a square pyramidal versus a vanadium(IV) in an octahedral environment featuring the same coordinating ligand, namely, the 1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate. This investigation, performed by a combined approach of alternate current (ac) susceptibility measurements and continuous wave (CW) and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies revealed that the effectiveness of the vanadyl moiety in enhancing quantum coherence up to room temperature is related to a less effective mechanism of spin\xe2\x80\x93lattice relaxation that can be quantitatively evaluated by the exponent n (ca. 3) of the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate. A more rapid collapse is observed for the non-oxo counterpart (n = 4) hampering the observation of quantum coherence at room temperature. Record coherence time at room temperature (1.04 \xce\xbcs) and Rabi oscillations are also observed for the vanadyl derivative in a very high concentrated material (5 \xc2\xb1 1%) as a result of the additional benefit provided by the use of a nuclear spin-free ligand."
"We design a new naphthalenediimide (NDI) \xcf\x80-system, NDI\xe2\x80\x93Fc\xe2\x80\x93NDI, having a ferrocene linker as a hinge unit and long alkyl chains as supramolecular assembling units. The NDI units are \xe2\x80\x9cdirectionally flexible\xe2\x80\x9d in concert with the pivoting motion of the ferrocene unit with a small rotational barrier. The NDI units rotate around the ferrocene unit faster than the NMR time scale in solution at room temperature. UV\xe2\x80\x93vis absorption, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and atomic force microscope studies reveal that NDI\xe2\x80\x93Fc\xe2\x80\x93NDI forms a fibrous supramolecular assembly in solution (methylcyclohexane and highly concentrated chloroform) and film states, wherein the NDI units are in the slipped-stack conformation. The NDI\xe2\x80\x93Fc\xe2\x80\x93NDI supramolecular assembly in the film state exhibits multiple phase transitions associated with conformational changes at different temperatures, which are confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry, polarized optical microscopy, and temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction. Such thermal transitions of NDI\xe2\x80\x93Fc\xe2\x80\x93NDI films also induce changes in the optical and electronic properties as revealed by UV\xe2\x80\x93vis absorption and photoelectron yield spectroscopies, respectively. The thermal behaviors of NDI\xe2\x80\x93Fc\xe2\x80\x93NDI, realized by the unique molecular design, are considerably different from the reference compounds such as an NDI dimer connected with a flexible 1,4-butylene linker. These results provide us with a plausible strategy to propagate the molecular dynamics of the \xcf\x80-system into macroscopic properties in film states; the key factors are (i) the supramolecular alignment of molecular switching units and (ii) the directional motion of the switching units perpendicular to the supramolecular axis."
"A combination of mass spectrometry, collision-induced dissociation, ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), and density functional theory (DFT) has been used to study the evolution of anionic species generated by laser-desorption of the near-planar, fluorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), C60H21F9 (s). The dominant decay process for isolated, thermally activated C60H21F9\xe2\x80\x93 species comprises a sequence of multiple regioselective cyclodehydrofluorination and cyclodehydrogenation reactions (eliminating HF and H2, respectively, while forming additional pentagons and/or hexagons). The DFT calculations allow us to set narrow bounds on the structures of the resulting fragment ions by fitting structural models to experimentally determined collision cross sections. These show that the transformation of the precursor anion proceeds via a series of intermediate structures characterized by increasing curvature, ultimately leading to the closed-shell fullerene cage C60\xe2\x80\x93 as preprogrammed by the precursor structure."
"In this report, we elaborate on two new concepts to activate arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). Early on, we have argued that repulsion-driven ion-pairing interactions with anionic lipids account for their ability to move across hydrophobic cell membranes and that hydrophobic anions such as pyrenebutyrate can accelerate this process to kinetically outcompete endosomal capture. The original explanation that the high activity of pyrenebutyrate might originate from ionpair\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interactions between CPP and activator implied that replacement of the \xcf\x80-basic pyrene with polarized push\xe2\x80\x93pull aromatics should afford more powerful CPP activators. To elaborate on this hypothesis, we prepared a small collection of anionic amphiphiles that could recognize cations by ionpair\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interactions. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find that parallel but not antiparallel ionpair\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interactions afford operational CPP activators in model membranes and cells. The alternative suggestion that the high activity of pyrenebutyrate might originate from self-assembly in membranes was explored with perfluorinated fatty acids. Their fluorophilicity was expected to promote self-assembly in membranes, while their high acidity should prevent charge neutralization in response to self-assembly, i.e., generate repulsion-driven ion-pairing interactions. Consistent with these expectations, we find that perfluorinated fatty acids are powerful CPP activators in HeLa cells but not in model membranes. These findings support parallel ionpair\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interactions and repulsion-driven ion pairing with self-assembled fluorophiles as innovative concepts to activate CPPs. These results also add much corroborative support for counterion-mediated uptake as the productive mode of action of arginine-rich CPPs."
"The kinetics and mechanism of the reactions of formyl-stabilized ylide Ph3P\xe2\x95\x90CHCHO (1) and acetyl-stabilized ylide Ph3P\xe2\x95\x90CHCOMe (2) with benzhydrylium ions (Ar2CH+, 3) were investigated by UV\xe2\x80\x93vis and NMR spectroscopy. As ambident nucleophiles, ylides 1 and 2 can react at oxygen as well as at the \xce\xb1-carbon. For some reactions, it was possible to determine the second-order rate constant for O-attack as well as for C-attack and to derive the nucleophile-specific parameters N and sN according to the correlation lg\xc2\xa0k (20 \xc2\xb0C) = sN(E + N) for both nucleophilic sites. Generally, O-attack of benzhydrylium ions is faster than C-attack. However, the initially formed benzhydryloxyvinylphosphonium ions can only be observed by NMR spectroscopy when benzhydryl cations with high Lewis acidity are employed. In other cases, rearrangement to the thermodynamically more stable products arising from C-attack occurs. The results derived from our investigations are employed to rationalize the behavior of ambident nucleophiles 1 and 2 in reactions with carbon-centered electrophiles in general. It is shown that the principle of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) and the related Klopman\xe2\x80\x93Salem concept of charge and orbital control lead to incorrect predictions of regioselectivity. We also show that the rate of the Wittig reaction of ylide 2 with aldehyde 14 is significantly faster than the rate of either C- or O-attack calculated using lg\xc2\xa0k (20 \xc2\xb0C) = sN(E + N), thus indicating that the oxaphosphetane is formed by a concerted [2 + 2] cycloaddition."
"While previous work has demonstrated that molecular packing in organic crystals can strongly influence photochemical stability, efforts to tune photostability in amorphous materials have shown much smaller effects. Here we show that physical vapor deposition can substantially improve the photostability of organic glasses. Disperse Orange 37 (DO37), an azobenzene derivative, is studied as a model system. Photostability is assessed through changes in the density and molecular orientation of glassy thin films during light irradiation. By optimizing the substrate temperature used for deposition, we can increase photostability by a factor of 50 relative to the liquid-cooled glass. Photostability correlates with glass density, with density increases of up to 1.3%. Coarse-grained molecular simulations, which mimic glass preparation and the photoisomerization reaction, also indicate that glasses with higher density have substantially increased photostability. These results provide insights that may assist in the design of organic photovoltaics and light-emission devices with longer lifetimes."
"Dps proteins are bacterial ferritins that protect DNA from oxidative stress and have been implicated in bacterial survival and virulence. In addition to direct oxidation of the Dps iron sites by diffusing oxidants, oxidation from a distance via DNA charge transport (CT), where electrons and electron holes are rapidly transported through the base-pair \xcf\x80-stack, could represent an efficient DNA protection mechanism utilized by Dps. Here, we spectroscopically characterize the DNA-mediated oxidation of ferrous iron-loaded Dps. X-band EPR was used to monitor the oxidation of DNA-bound Dps after DNA photooxidation using an intercalating ruthenium photooxidant and the flash-quench technique. Upon irradiation with poly(dGdC)2, a signal arises with g = 4.3, consistent with the formation of mononuclear high-spin Fe(III) sites of low symmetry, the expected oxidation product of Dps with one iron bound at each ferroxidase site. When poly(dGdC)2 is substituted with poly(dAdT)2, the yield of Dps oxidation is decreased significantly, consistent with guanine radical intermediates facilitating Dps oxidation. We have also explored possible protein electron transfer (ET) intermediates in the DNA-mediated oxidation of ferrous iron-loaded Dps. Dps proteins contain a conserved tryptophan residue in close proximity to the iron-binding ferroxidase site (W52 in E. coli Dps). In EPR studies of the oxidation of ferrous iron-loaded Dps following DNA photooxidation, a W52A Dps mutant was significantly deficient compared to WT Dps in forming the characteristic EPR signal at g = 4.3, consistent with W52 acting as an ET hopping intermediate. This effect is mirrored in vivo in E. coli survival in response to hydrogen peroxide, where mutation of W52 leads to decreased survival under oxidative stress."
"Protecting-group-free transformation is a challenging and important issue in atom-economical organic synthesis. The \xce\xb76-arene/N-Me-sulfonyldiamine\xe2\x80\x93Ru(II)\xe2\x80\x93BF4 complex-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 2-substituted unprotected indoles in weakly acidic hexafluoroisopropanol gives optically active indoline compounds with up to >99% ee. Under mild reaction media, halogen atoms and synthetically important protecting groups (e.g., silyl ether, acetal, benzyl ether, and ester) on indoles are maintained, which is advantageous for the synthesis of further complex indoline molecules."
"Mesoporous colloidal particles with tailored asymmetric morphologies and radially oriented large channels are of great importance for development of new carriers for nanoencapsulation, high-performance mass transport nanosystems, and complex assembly structures. However, controllable anisotropic growth to asymmetric mesoporous particles is very challenging via the universal surfactant-directed soft-templating method. Herein we report a simple emulsion-induced interface anisotropic assembly approach to synthesize bowl-like mesoporous polydopamine particles with diameter of \xe2\x88\xbc210 nm, well-controlled radially oriented mesochannels, and large pore size of \xe2\x88\xbc11 nm. This interface-driven approach also creates opportunities for tailoring the assembly and formation of various asymmetric and symmetric polydopamine particles. Bowl-like mesoporous carbon particles with radially oriented channels, high accessible surface area of 619 m2 g\xe2\x80\x931, and large pore size of \xe2\x88\xbc8 nm can be fabricated by subsequent hydrothermal treatment and calcination under nitrogen atmosphere. Lastly, we demonstrate that the as-derived bowl-like mesoporous carbon particles manifest enhanced electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline electrolyte."
"We hereby describe a strategy for obtaining novel topological nanostructures consisting of dual-cavity basket 1, forming a curved monolayer of large unilamellar vesicles in water (CAC < 0.25 \xce\xbcM), and bivalent guests 4/5 populating the cavities of such bolaamphiphilic hosts. On the basis of the results of 1H NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering measurements, we postulated that divalent guest molecules 4/5 cover the curved vesicular surface in a lateral fashion to satisfy the complexation [2 + 2] valency and thereby give stable two-dimensional supramolecular polymers [1\xe2\x8a\x824]n and [1\xe2\x8a\x825]n. The results of experimental studies are also supported with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics. Our discovery about the assembly of novel vesicular structures could be of interest for stabilization/functionalization of liposomal surfaces as well as detection of polyvalent molecules and removal of targeted substances from aqueous environments."
"In recent years, the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become a serious health concern. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an important component of the innate immune system of most organisms. A better understanding of their structures and mechanisms of action would lead to the design of more potent and safer AMPs as alternatives for current antibiotics. For detailed investigations, effective recombinant production which allows the facile modification of the amino acid sequence, the introduction of unnatural amino acids, and labeling with stable isotopes for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies is desired. Several expression strategies have been introduced in previous reports; however, their effectiveness has been limited to a select few AMPs. Here, we have studied calmodulin (CaM) as a more universal carrier protein to express many types of AMPs in E. coli. We have discovered that the unique architecture of CaM, consisting of two independent target binding domains with malleable methionine-rich interaction surfaces, can accommodate numerous amino acid sequences containing basic and hydrophobic residues. This effectively masks the toxic antimicrobial activities of many amphipathic AMPs and protects them from degradation during expression and purification. Here, we demonstrate the expression of various AMPs using a CaM-fusion expression system, including melittin, fowlicidin-1, tritrpticin, indolicidin, puroindoline A peptide, magainin II F5W, lactoferrampin B, MIP3\xce\xb151\xe2\x80\x9370, and human \xce\xb2-defensin 3 (HBD-3), the latter requiring three disulfide bonds for proper folding. In addition, our approach was extended to the transmembrane domain of the cell adhesion protein l-selectin. We propose the use of the CaM-fusion system as a universal approach to express many cationic amphipathic peptides that are normally toxic and would kill the bacterial host cells."
"We report herein the synthesis and characterization of a fluorogenic analogue of ubiquinone designed to reversibly report on redox reactions in biological systems. The analogue, H2B-Q, consists of the redox-active quinone segment found in ubiquinone, 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone, coupled to a boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) fluorophore segment that both imparts lipophilicity in lieu of the isoprenyl tail of ubiquinone, and reports on redox changes at the quinone/quinol segment. Redox sensing is mediated by a photoinduced electron transfer intramolecular switch. In its reduced dihydroquinone form, H2B-QH2 is highly emissive in nonpolar media (quantum yields 55\xe2\x80\x9366%), while once oxidized, the resulting quinone H2B-Q emission is suppressed. Cyclic voltammetry of H2B-Q shows two reversible, 1-electron reduction peaks at \xe2\x88\x921.05 V and \xe2\x88\x921.37 V (vs ferrocene) on par with those of ubiquinone. Chemical reduction of H2B-Q by NaBH4 resulted in >200 fold emission enhancement. H2B-QH2 is shown to react with peroxyl radicals, a form of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as to cooperatively interact with chromanol (the active segment of \xce\xb1-tocopherol). Kinetic analysis further shows the antioxidant reactivity of the nonfluorescent intermediate semiquinone. We anticipate that the H2B-Q/H2B-QH2 off/on reversible couple may serve as a tool to monitor chemical redox processes in real-time and in a noninvasive manner."
"Intermolecular orbital coupling is fundamentally important to organic semiconductor performance. Recently, we reported that 2,6\xe2\x80\xb2:2\xe2\x80\xb2,6\xe2\x80\xb3-terazulene (TAz1) exhibited excellent performance as an n-type organic field-effect transistor (OFET) via molecular orbital distribution control. To validate and develop this concept, here we present three other terazulene regioisomers, which have three azulene molecules connected at the 2- or 6-position along the long axis of the azulene, thus constructing a linear expanded \xcf\x80-conjugation system: 2,2\xe2\x80\xb2:6\xe2\x80\xb2,2\xe2\x80\xb3-terazulene (TAz2), 2,2\xe2\x80\xb2:6\xe2\x80\xb2,6\xe2\x80\xb3-terazulene (TAz3), and 6,2\xe2\x80\xb2:6\xe2\x80\xb2,6\xe2\x80\xb3-terazulene (TAz4). TAz2 and TAz3 exhibit ambipolar characteristics; TAz4 exhibits clear n-type transistor behavior as an OFET. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of all terazulenes are fully delocalized over the entire molecule. In contrast, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of TAz2 and TAz3 are delocalized over the 2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-biazulene units; the HOMOs of TAz4 are localized at one end of the azulene unit. These findings confirm that terazulene isomers which are simple hydrocarbon compounds are versatile materials with a tunable-polarity FET characteristic that depends on the direction of the azulene unit and the related contrast of the molecular orbital distribution in the terazulene backbone."
"Enzymes rely on complex interactions between precisely positioned active site residues as a mechanism to compensate for the limited functionality contained within the genetic code. Heme enzymes provide a striking example of this complexity, whereby the electronic properties of reactive ferryl intermediates are finely tuned through hydrogen bonding interactions between proximal ligands and neighboring amino acids. Here, we show that introduction of a chemically programmed proximal N\xce\xb4-methyl histidine (NMH) ligand into an engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APX2) overcomes the reliance on the conserved Asp-His hydrogen bonding interaction, leading to a catalytically modified enzyme (APX2 NMH), which is able to achieve a significantly higher number of turnovers compared with APX2 without compromising catalytic efficiency. Structural, spectroscopic and kinetic characterization of APX2 NMH and several active site variants provides valuable insights into the role of the Asp-His-Fe triad of heme peroxidases. More significantly, simplification of catalytic mechanisms through the incorporation of chemically optimized ligands may facilitate efforts to create and evolve new active site heme environments within proteins."
"A chiral Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid containing two different acidic sites, chiral carboxylic acid\xe2\x80\x93monophosphoric acid 1a, was designed to be a new and effective concept in catalytic asymmetric hetero-Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder reactions of azopyridinecarboxylate with amidodienes. The multipoint hydrogen-bonding interactions among the carboxylic acid, monophosphoric acid, azopyridinecarboxylate, and amidodiene achieved high catalytic and chiral efficiency, producing substituted 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridazines with excellent stereocontrol in a single step. This constitutes the first example of regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective azo-hetero-Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder reactions by chiral Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid catalysis."
"We herein report a new catalytic method for intermolecular olefin aminofluorination using earth-abundant iron catalysts and nucleophilic fluoride ion. This method tolerates a broad range of unfunctionalized olefins, especially nonstyrenyl olefins that are incompatible with existing olefin aminofluorination methods. This new iron-catalyzed process directly converts readily available olefins to internal vicinal fluoro carbamates with high regioselectivity (N vs F), many of which are difficult to prepare using known methods. Preliminary mechanistic studies demonstrate that it is possible to exert asymmetric induction using chiral iron catalysts and that both an iron-nitrenoid and carbocation species may be reactive intermediates."
"The C\xe2\x80\x93H bond activation of methane mediated by a prototypical heteronuclear metal-oxide cluster, [Al2Mg2O5]\xe2\x80\xa2+, was investigated by using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) in conjunction with high-level quantum mechanical calculations. Experimentally, hydrogen-atom abstraction from methane by the cluster ion [Al2Mg2O5]\xe2\x80\xa2+ takes place at ambient conditions. As to the mechanism, according to our computational findings, both the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and the conventional hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) are feasible and compete with each other. This is in distinct contrast to the [XYO2]+ (X, Y = Mg, Al, Si) cluster oxide ions which activate methane exclusively via the PCET route (Li, J.; Zhou, S.; Zhang, J.; Schlangen, M.; Weiske, T.; Usharani, D.; Shaik, S.; Schwarz, H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 7973\xe2\x80\x937981). The electronic origins of the mechanistically rather complex reactivity scenarios of the [Al2Mg2O5]\xe2\x80\xa2+/CH4 couple were elucidated. For the PCET mechanism, in which the Lewis acid\xe2\x80\x93base pair [Al+\xe2\x80\x93O\xe2\x80\x93] of the cluster acts as the active site, a clear correlation has been established between the nature of the transition state, the corresponding barrier height, the Lewis acidity-basicity of the [M+\xe2\x80\x93O\xe2\x80\x93] unit, as well as the bond order of the M+\xe2\x80\x93O\xe2\x80\x93 bond. Also addressed is the role of the spin and charge distributions of a terminal oxygen radical site in the direct HAT route. The knowledge of the factors that control the reactivity of PCET and HAT pathways not only deepens our mechanistic understanding of metal-oxide mediated C\xe2\x80\x93H bond activation but may also provide guidance for the rational design of catalysts."
"Research on zero-valent p-block elements is a recent hot topic in synthetic and theoretical chemistry because of their novel electronic states having two lone pairs in both the s- and p-orbitals. It is considered that \xcf\x83-donating ligands bearing large substituents are essential to stabilize these species. Herein, we propose a new approach using butadiene as a 4\xcf\x80-electron donor to stabilize zero-valent group 14 elements. During our study to explore the coordination chemistry of stannacyclopentadienyl ligands, unexpected products, in which the tin atom is coordinated by a butadiene in a \xce\xb74-fashion, were obtained. Because butadiene is a neutral 4\xcf\x80-electron donating ligand, the formal oxidation number of the tin atoms of the products should be zero, which is supported by X-ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculations. A mechanism for the formation of the products is also described."
"We report the first total syntheses of (+)-haplocidine and its N1-amide congener (+)-haplocine. Our concise synthesis of these alkaloids required the development of a late-stage and highly selective C\xe2\x80\x93H oxidation of complex aspidosperma alkaloid derivatives. A versatile, amide-directed ortho-acetoxylation of indoline amides enabled our implementation of a unified strategy for late-stage diversification of hexacyclic C19-hemiaminal ether structures via oxidation of the corresponding pentacyclic C19-iminium ions. An electrophilic amide activation of a readily available C21-oxygenated lactam, followed by transannular cyclization and in situ trapping of a transiently formed C19-iminium ion, expediently provided access to hexacyclic C19-hemiaminal ether alkaloids (+)-fendleridine, (+)-acetylaspidoalbidine, and (+)-propionylaspidoalbidine. A highly effective enzymatic resolution of a non-\xce\xb2-branched primary alcohol (E = 22) allowed rapid preparation of both enantiomeric forms of a C21-oxygenated precursor for synthesis of these aspidosperma alkaloids. Our synthetic strategy provides succinct access to hexacyclic aspidosperma derivatives, including the antiproliferative alkaloid (+)-haplocidine."
"A family of bandgap-tunable pyrroles structurally related to rylene dyes was computationally designed and prepared using robust, easily scalable chemistry. These pyrroles show highly variable fluorescence properties and can be used as building blocks for the synthesis of electron-deficient oligopyrroles. The latter application is demonstrated through the development of \xcf\x80-extended porphyrins containing naphthalenediamide or naphthalenediimide units. These new macrocycles exhibit simultaneously tunable visible and near-IR absorptions, an ability to accept up to 8 electrons via electrochemical reduction, and high internal molecular free volumes. When chemically reduced under inert conditions, the most electron-deficient of these macrocycles revealed reversible formation of eight charged states, characterized by remarkably red-shifted optical absorptions, extending beyond 2200 nm. Such features make these oligopyrroles of interest as functional chromophores, charge-storage materials, and tectons for crystal engineering."
"N-Aryl phenoxazines have been synthesized and introduced as strongly reducing metal-free photoredox catalysts in organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization for the synthesis of well-defined polymers. Experiments confirmed quantum chemical predictions that, like their dihydrophenazine analogs, the photoexcited states of phenoxazine photoredox catalysts are strongly reducing and achieve superior performance when they possess charge transfer character. We compare phenoxazines to previously reported dihydrophenazines and phenothiazines as photoredox catalysts to gain insight into the performance of these catalysts and establish principles for catalyst design. A key finding reveals that maintenance of a planar conformation of the phenoxazine catalyst during the catalytic cycle encourages the synthesis of well-defined macromolecules. Using these principles, we realized a core substituted phenoxazine as a visible light photoredox catalyst that performed superior to UV-absorbing phenoxazines as well as previously reported organic photocatalysts in organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization. Using this catalyst and irradiating with white LEDs resulted in the production of polymers with targeted molecular weights through achieving quantitative initiator efficiencies, which possess dispersities ranging from 1.13 to 1.31."
Computer simulations provide insight into the profound effect of surface water on the activity of a heterogeneous catalyst.
"The rational design of well-defined, first-row transition metal complexes that can activate dioxygen has been a challenging goal for the synthetic inorganic chemist. The activation of O2 is important in part because of its central role in the functioning of metalloenzymes, which utilize O2 to perform a number of challenging reactions including the highly selective oxidation of various substrates. There is also great interest in utilizing O2, an abundant and environmentally benign oxidant, in synthetic catalytic oxidation systems. This Perspective brings together recent examples of biomimetic Fe and Mn complexes that can activate O2 in heme or nonheme-type ligand environments. The use of oxidants such as hypervalent iodine (e.g., ArIO), peracids (e.g., m-CPBA), peroxides (e.g., H2O2) or even superoxide is a popular choice for accessing well-characterized metal\xe2\x80\x93superoxo, metal\xe2\x80\x93peroxo, or metal\xe2\x80\x93oxo species, but the instances of biomimetic Fe/Mn complexes that react with dioxygen to yield such observable metal\xe2\x80\x93oxygen species are surprisingly few. This Perspective focuses on mononuclear Fe and Mn complexes that exhibit reactivity with O2 and lead to spectroscopically observable metal\xe2\x80\x93oxygen species, and/or oxidize biologically relevant substrates. Analysis of these examples reveals that solvent, spin state, redox potential, external co-reductants, and ligand architecture can all play important roles in the O2 activation process."
"There is significant interest in developing methods that visualize and detect RNA. Bioorthogonal template-driven tetrazine ligations could be a powerful route to visualizing nucleic acids in native cells, yet past work has been limited with respect to the diversity of fluorogens that can be activated via a tetrazine reaction. Herein we report a novel bioorthogonal tetrazine uncaging reaction that harnesses tetrazine reactivity to unmask vinyl ether caged fluorophores spanning the visible spectrum, including a near-infrared (NIR)-emitting cyanine dye. Vinyl ether caged fluorophores and tetrazine partners are conjugated to high-affinity antisense nucleic acid probes, which show highly selective fluorogenic reactivity when annealed to their respective target RNA sequences. A target sequence in the 3\xe2\x80\xb2 untranslated region of an expressed mRNA was detected in live cells employing appropriate nucleic acid probes bearing a tetrazine-reactive NIR fluorogen. Given the expansion of tetrazine fluorogenic chemistry to NIR dyes, we believe highly selective proximity-induced fluorogenic tetrazine reactions could find broad uses in illuminating endogenous biomolecules in cells and tissues."
"Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are crystalline polymer networks whose modular 2D structures and permanent porosity motivate efforts to integrate them into sensing, energy storage, and optoelectronic devices. These applications require forming the material as a thin film instead of a microcrystalline powder, which has been achieved previously by including a substrate in the reaction mixture. This approach suffers from two key drawbacks: COF precipitates form concurrently and contaminate the film, and variable monomer and oligomer concentrations during the polymerization provide poor control over film thickness. Here we address these challenges by growing 2D COF thin films under continuous flow conditions. Initially homogeneous monomer solutions polymerize while pumped through heated tubing for a given residence time, after which they pass over a substrate. When the residence time and conditions are chosen judiciously, 2D COF powders form downstream of the substrate, and the chemical composition of the solution at the substrate remains constant. COF films grown in flow exhibit constant rates of mass deposition, enabling thickness control as well as access to thicker films than are available from previous static growth procedures. Notably, the crystallinity of COF films is observed only at longer residence times, suggesting that oligomeric and polymeric species play an important role in forming the 2D COF lattice. This approach, which we demonstrate for four different frameworks, is both a simple and powerful method to control the formation of COF thin films."
"Janus particles are colloidal analogues of molecular amphiphiles that can self-assemble to form diverse suprastructures, exhibit motility under appropriate catalytic reactions, and strongly adsorb to fluid\xe2\x80\x93fluid interfaces to stabilize multiphasic fluid mixtures. The chemistry of Janus particles is the fundamental parameter that controls their behavior and utility as colloid surfactants in bulk solution and at fluid interfaces. To enable their widespread utilization, scalable methods that allow for the synthesis of Janus particles with diverse chemical compositions and shapes are highly desirable. Here, we develop clickable Janus particles that can be modified through thiol\xe2\x80\x93yne click reactions with commercially available thiols. Janus particles are modified to be amphiphilic by introducing either carboxyl, hydroxyl, or amine moieties. We also demonstrate that regulating the extent of the modification can be used to control the particle morphology, and thus the type of emulsion stabilized, as well as to fabricate composite Janus particles through sequential click reactions. Modifying Janus particles through thiol\xe2\x80\x93yne click chemistry provides a fast-reacting, scalable synthesis method for the fabrication of diverse Janus particles."
"Thionitrous acid (HSNO), a potential key intermediate in biological signaling pathways, has been proposed to link NO and H2S biochemistries, but its existence and stability in vivo remain controversial. We establish that HSNO is spontaneously formed in high concentration when NO and H2S gases are mixed at room temperature in the presence of metallic surfaces. Our measurements reveal that HSNO is formed by the reaction H2S + N2O3 \xe2\x86\x92 HSNO + HNO2, where N2O3 is a product of NO disproportionation. These studies also suggest that further reaction of HSNO with H2S may form HNO and HSSH. The length of the S\xe2\x80\x93N bond has been derived to high precision and is found to be unusually long: 1.84 \xc3\x85, the longest S\xe2\x80\x93N bond reported to date for an R-SNO compound. The present structural and, particularly, reactivity investigations of this elusive molecule provide a firm foundation to better understand its potential physiological chemistry and propensity to undergo S\xe2\x80\x93N bond cleavage in vivo."
"The structure of graphene oxide (GO) is a matter of discussion. While established GO models are based on functional groups attached to the carbon framework, another frequently used model claims that GO consists of two components, a slightly oxidized graphene core and highly oxidized molecular species, oxidative debris (OD), adsorbed on it. Those adsorbents are claimed to be the origin for optical properties of GO. Here, we examine this model by preparing GO with a low degree of functionalization, combining it with OD and studying the optical properties of both components and their combination in an artificial two-component system. The analyses of absorption and emission spectra as well as lifetime measurements reveal that properties of the combined system are distinctly different from those of GO. That confirms structural models of GO as a separate oxygenated hexagonal carbon framework with optical properties governed by its internal structure rather than the presence of OD. Understanding the structure of GO allows further reliable interpretation of its optical and electronic properties and enables controlled processing of GO."
"Carbon dioxide adsorption in metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks has been widely studied for applications in carbon capture and sequestration. A critical component that has been largely overlooked is the measurement of diffusion rates. This paper describes a new reproducible procedure to synthesize millimeter-scale Cu-BTC single crystals using concentrated reactants and an acetic acid modulator. Microscopic images, X-ray diffraction patterns, Brunauer\xe2\x80\x93Emmett\xe2\x80\x93Teller surface areas, and thermogravimetric analysis results all confirm the high quality of these Cu-BTC single crystals. The large crystal size aids in the accurate measurement of micropore diffusion coefficients. Concentration-swing frequency response performed at varying gas-phase concentrations gives diffusion coefficients that show very little dependence on the loading up to pressures of 0.1 bar. The measured micropore diffusion coefficient for CO2 in Cu-BTC is 1.7 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x939 m2/s."
"Shape-controlled synthesis of metal nanoparticles (NPs) requires mechanistic understanding toward the development of modern nanoscience and nanotechnology. We demonstrate here an unconventional shape transformation of Au@Ag core\xe2\x80\x93shell NPs (nanorods and nanocubes) into octahedral nanorattles via room-temperature galvanic replacement coupled with seeded growth. The corresponding morphological and chemical transformations were investigated in three dimensions, using state-of-the-art X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) tomography. The addition of a reducing agent (ascorbic acid) plays a key role in this unconventional mechanistic path, in which galvanic replacement is found to dominate initially when the shell is made of Ag, while seeded growth suppresses transmetalation when a composition of Au:Ag (\xe2\x88\xbc60:40) is reached in the shell, as revealed by quantitative XEDS tomography. This work not only opens new avenues toward the shape control of hollow NPs beyond the morphology of sacrificial templates, but also expands our understanding of chemical transformations in nanoscale galvanic replacement reactions. The XEDS electron tomography study presented here can be generally applied to investigate a wide range of nanoscale morphological and chemical transformations."
"The base pair d5SICS\xc2\xb7dNaM was recently reported to incorporate and replicate in the DNA of a modified strain of Escherichia coli, thus making the world\xe2\x80\x99s first stable semisynthetic organism. This newly expanded genetic alphabet may allow organisms to store considerably more information in order to translate proteins with unprecedented enzymatic activities. Importantly, however, there is currently no knowledge of the photochemical properties of d5SICS or dNaM\xe2\x80\x94properties that are central to the chemical integrity of cellular DNA. In this contribution, it is shown that excitation of d5SICS or dNaM with near-visible light leads to efficient trapping of population in the nucleoside\xe2\x80\x99s excited triplet state in high yield. Photoactivation of these long-lived, reactive states is shown to photosensitize cells, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species and to a marked decrease in cell proliferation, thus warning scientists of the potential phototoxic side effects of expanding the genetic alphabet."
"An enantioselective redox-relay oxidative Heck arylation of 1,1-disubstituted alkenes to construct \xce\xb2-stereocenters was developed using a new pyridyl-oxazoline ligand. Various 1,2-diaryl carbonyl compounds were readily obtained in moderate yield and good to excellent enantioselectivity. Additionally, analysis of the reaction outcomes using multidimensional correlations revealed that enantioselectivity is tied to specific electronic features of the 1,1-disubstituted alkenol and the extent of polarizability of the ligand."
"Rhodacyclopentanones derived from carbonylative C\xe2\x80\x93C activation of cyclopropyl ureas can be \xe2\x80\x9ccaptured\xe2\x80\x9d by pendant nucleophiles prior to \xe2\x80\x9ccollapse\xe2\x80\x9d to 1,3-diazepanes. The choice of N-substituent on the cyclopropane unit controls the oxidation level of the product, such that C4\xe2\x80\x93C5 unsaturated or saturated systems can be accessed selectively."
"The propeller-like conformation of tetraphenylethylene (TPE) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect was partially and completely fixed by intramolecular cyclization for the first time. The immobilization of propeller-like conformation was found to show great advantages in determining the enantiomer purity, identifying the chiral amines. The completely fixed conformers are resolved into M- and P-enantiomer, which showed mirror imaged CD and almost quantitative fluorescence quantum yield. Furthermore, it also showed a mirror and large circularly polarized luminescence dissymmetric factor, depending on the helicity of the enantiomer. The result provides the most direct and persuasive evidence for AIE via the restriction of intramolecular rotation and finds the new insight of the compounds in chiroptical property."
"Sialic acids are typically linked \xce\xb1(2-3) or \xce\xb1(2-6) to the galactose that located at the non-reducing terminal end of glycans, playing important but distinct roles in a variety of biological and pathological processes. However, details about their respective roles are still largely unknown due to the lack of an effective analytical technique. Herein, a two-step chemoenzymatic approach for the rapid and sensitive detection of N-acetylneuraminic acid\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb1(2-3)-galactose glycans is described."
"Pressure-dependent structural and chemical changes of the zeolitic imidazolate framework compound ZIF-8 have been investigated using different pressure transmitting media (PTM) up to 4 GPa. The unit cell of ZIF-8 expands and contracts under hydrostatic pressure depending on the solvent molecules used as PTM. When pressurized in water up to 2.2(1) GPa, the unit cell of ZIF-8 reveals a gradual contraction. In contrast, when alcohols are used as PTM, the ZIF-8 unit cell volume initially expands by 1.2% up to 0.3(1) GPa in methanol, and by 1.7% up to 0.6(1) GPa in ethanol. Further pressure increase then leads to a discontinuous second volume expansion by 1.9% at 1.4(1) GPa in methanol and by 0.3% at 2.3(1) GPa in ethanol. The continuous uptake of molecules under pressure, modeled by the residual electron density derived from Rietveld refinements of X-ray powder diffraction, reveals a saturation pressure near 2 GPa. In non-penetrating PTM (silicone oil), ZIF-8 becomes amorphous at 0.9(1) GPa. The structural changes observed in the ZIF-8-PTM system under pressure point to distinct molecular interactions within the pores."
An efficient and enantioselective synthesis of oxa[9]helicenes has been established via vanadium(V)-catalyzed oxidative coupling/intramolecular cyclization of polycyclic phenols. A newly developed vanadium complex cooperatively functions as both a redox and Lewis acid catalyst to promote the present sequential reaction and afford oxa[9]helicenes in good yields with up to 94% ee.
"DNA glycosylases protect genomic integrity by locating and excising aberrant nucleobases. Substrate recognition and excision usually take place in an extrahelical conformation, which is often stabilized by \xcf\x80-stacking interactions between the lesion nucleobase and aromatic side chains in the glycosylase active site. Bacillus cereus AlkD is the only DNA glycosylase known to catalyze base excision without extruding the damaged nucleotide from the DNA helix. Instead of contacting the nucleobase itself, the AlkD active site interacts with the lesion deoxyribose through a series of C\xe2\x80\x93H/\xcf\x80 interactions. These interactions are ubiquitous in protein structures, but evidence for their catalytic significance in enzymology is lacking. Here, we show that the C\xe2\x80\x93H/\xcf\x80 interactions between AlkD and the lesion deoxyribose participate in catalysis of glycosidic bond cleavage. This is the first demonstration of a catalytic role for C\xe2\x80\x93H/\xcf\x80 interactions as intermolecular forces important to DNA repair."
"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represent a new type of crystalline porous materials that are covalently assembled from organic building blocks. Construction of functional COFs is, however, a difficult task because it has to meet simultaneously the requirements for crystallinity and functionality. We report herein a facile strategy for the direct construction of chiral-functionalized COFs from chiral building blocks. The key design is to use the rigid scaffold 4,4\xe2\x80\xb2-(1H-benzo[d]imidazole-4,7-diyl)dianiline (2) for attaching a variety of chiral moieties. As a first example, the chiral pyrrolidine-embedded building block (S)-4,4\xe2\x80\xb2-(2-(pyrrolidin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-4,7-diyl)dianiline (3) was accordingly synthesized and applied for the successful construction of two chiral COFs, LZU-72 and LZU-76. Our experimental results further showed that these chiral COFs are structurally robust and highly active as heterogeneous organocatalysts."
"Synthesis of stereoregular polyesters with main-chain chirality was achieved for the first time by the asymmetric copolymerization of meso-epoxides and cyclic anhydrides using catalyst systems based on enantiopure bimetallic complexes. The combination of the biphenol-linked dinuclear aluminum complex with tert-butyl groups in the phenolate ortho-positions and a nucleophilic co-catalyst was found to be more efficient in catalyzing this asymmetric copolymerization, affording enantiomerically enriched polyesters (up to 91% ee) with completely alternating structure and narrow molecular weight distribution. It was discovered that the isotactic-enriched poly(cyclopentene phthalate) is a typical semicrystalline material with a melting endothermic peak at 221 \xc2\xb0C. This study is expected to provide a promising route to prepare various stereoregular polyesters having a wide variety of physical properties and degradability."
"An in situ doping strategy has been developed for the generation of a novel family of hexaazatriphenylene-based conjugated triazine frameworks (CTFs) for efficient CO2 capture. The resulting task-specific materials exhibit an exceptionally high CO2 uptake capacity (up to 4.8 mmol g\xe2\x80\x931 at 297 K and 1 bar). The synergistic effects of ultrananoporosity and rich N/O codoped CO2-philic sites bestow the framework with the highest CO2 adsorption capacity among known porous organic polymers (POPs). This innovative approach not only enables superior CO2 separation performance but also provides tunable control of surface features on POPs, thereby affording control over bulk material properties. We anticipate this novel strategy will facilitate new possibilities for the rational design and synthesis of nanoporous materials for carbon capture."
"We report the synthesis of Janus bottlebrush block copolymers by graft-through polymerization of branched diblock macromonomers. Self-assembly of the bottlebrushes was characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Phase separation and packing models of the bottlebrushes were computed, and their self-assembly behavior was corroborated experimentally in bulk and in thin films. Lamellar, hexagonal cylinder, and gyroid phases were observed and modeled. The A-branch-B Janus bottlebrush structure provides several unique advantages in the context of bottlebrush polymer assembly, including access to the first examples of gyroid phases."
"A highly conducting electronic contact between a strained disilane and Au is demonstrated through scanning tunneling microscope-based single-molecule measurements. Conformationally locked cis diastereomers of bis(sulfide)-anchor-equipped 1,2-disilaacenaphthenes readily form high-conducting junctions in which the two sulfide anchors bind in a bipodal fashion to one gold electrode, providing enough stability for a stable electrical contact between the Si\xe2\x80\x93Si \xcf\x83 bond and the other electrode."
"The simplest N-sulfonylamine HNSO2 has been generated in the gas phase through flash vacuum pyrolysis of methoxysulfonyl azide CH3OS(O)2N3. Its identification was accomplished by combining matrix-isolation IR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Both experimental and theoretical evidence suggest a stepwise decomposition of the azide via the methoxysulfonyl nitrene CH3OS(O)2N, observed in the 193 nm laser photolysis of the azide, with concerted fragmentation into CH2O and HNSO2. Upon the 193 nm laser irradiation, HNSO2 isomerizes into the novel N-hydroxysulfinylamine HONSO."
"Electron-rich and -poor BN-heterocycles with benzyl-pyridyl  backbones and two bulky aryls  on the boron  (Ar = tipp, BN-1, Ar = MesF, BN-2) have been found to display distinct molecular transformations upon irradiation by UV light. BN-1 undergoes an efficient photoelimination reaction forming a BN-phenanthrene with \xce\xa6PE = 0.25, whereas BN-2 undergoes a thermally reversible, stereoselective, and quantitative isomerization to a dark colored BN-1,3,5-cyclooctatriene (BN-1,3,5-COT, BN-2a). This unusual photoisomerization persists for other BN-heterocycles with electron-deficient aryls  such as BN-3 with a benzyl-benzothiazolyl backbone and MesF substituents or BN-4 with a benzyl-pyridyl backbone and two C6F5 groups on the boron. The photoisomerization of BN-4 goes beyond BN-1,3,5-COT (BN-4a), forming a new  species (BN-1,3,6-COT, BN-4b) via C\xe2\x80\x93F bond cleavage and [1,3]-F atom sigmatropic migration. Computational studies support that BN-4a is an intermediate in the formation of BN-4b. This work establishes that steric and electronic factors can effectively control the transformations of BN-heterocycles, allowing access to important and previously unknown BN-embedded species."
"There is a growing interest in the development of single-component molecular conductors based on neutral organic radicals that are mainly formed by delocalized planar radicals, such as phenalenyl or thiazolyl radicals. However, there are no examples of systems based on nonplanar and spin-localized C-centered radicals exhibiting electrical conductivity due to their large Coulomb energy (U) repulsion and narrow electronic bandwidth (W) that give rise to a Mott insulator behavior. Here we present a new type of nonplanar neutral radical conductor attained by linking a tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) donor unit to a neutral polychlorotriphenylmethyl radical (PTM) with the important feature that the TTF unit enhances the overlap between the radical molecules as a consequence of short intermolecular S\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7S interactions. This system becomes semiconducting upon the application of high pressure thanks to increased electronic bandwidth and charge reorganization opening the way to develop a new family of neutral radical conductors."
"Water dynamics in the hydration shell of the peripheral membrane protein annexin B12 were studied using MD simulations and Overhauser DNP-enhanced NMR. We show that retardation of water motions near phospholipid bilayers is extended by the presence of a membrane-bound protein, up to around 10 \xc3\x85 above that protein. Near the membrane surface, electrostatic interactions with the lipid head groups strongly slow down water dynamics, whereas protein-induced water retardation is weaker and dominates only at distances beyond 10 \xc3\x85 from the membrane surface. The results can be understood from a simple model based on additive contributions from the membrane and the protein to the activation free energy barriers of water diffusion next to the biomolecular surfaces. Furthermore, analysis of the intermolecular vibrations of the water network reveals that retarded water motions near the membrane shift the vibrational modes to higher frequencies, which we used to identify an entropy gradient from the membrane surface toward the bulk water. Our results have implications for processes that take place at lipid membrane surfaces, including molecular recognition, binding, and protein\xe2\x80\x93protein interactions."
"Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions were studied in acetonitrile for a Photosystem II (PSII)-inspired [Ru(bpy)2(phen-imidazole-Ph(OH)(tBu)2)]2+, in which Ru(III) generated by a flash\xe2\x80\x93quench sequence oxidizes the appended phenol and the proton is transferred to the hydrogen-bonded imidazole base. In contrast to related systems, the donor and acceptor are strongly coupled, as indicated by the shift in the RuIII/II couple upon phenol oxidation, and intramolecular oxidation of the phenol by Ru(III) is energetically favorable by both stepwise and concerted pathways. The phenol oxidation occurs via a stepwise ET-PT mechanism with kET = 2.7 \xc3\x97 107 s\xe2\x80\x931 and a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 0.99 \xc2\xb1 0.03. The electron transfer reaction was characterized as adiabatic with \xce\xbbDA = 1.16 eV and 280 < HDA < 540 cm\xe2\x80\x931 consistent with strong electronic coupling and slow solvent dynamics. Reduction of the phenoxyl radical by the quencher radical was examined as the analogue of the redox reaction between the PSII tyrosyl radical and the oxygen-evolving complex. In our PSII-inspired complex, the recombination reaction activation energy is <2 kcal mol\xe2\x80\x931. The reaction is nonadiabatic (VPCET \xe2\x89\x88 22 cm\xe2\x80\x931 (H) and 49 cm\xe2\x80\x931 (D)) and concerted, and it exhibits an unexpected inverse KIE = 0.55 that is attributed to greater overlap of the reactant vibronic ground state with the OD vibronic states of the proton acceptor due to the smaller quantum spacing of the deuterium vibrational levels."
"Carbon\xe2\x80\x93carbon bond cleavage of benzene by transition metals is of great fundamental interest and practical importance, as this transformation is involved in the production of fuels and other important chemicals in the industrial hydrocracking of naphtha on solid catalysts. Although this transformation is thought to rely on cooperation of multiple metal sites, molecular-level information on the reaction mechanism has remained scarce to date. Here, we report the DFT studies of the ring cleavage and contraction of benzene by a molecular trinuclear titanium hydride cluster. Our studies suggest that the reaction is initiated by benzene coordination, followed by H2 release, C6H6 hydrometalation, repeated C\xe2\x80\x93C and C\xe2\x80\x93H bond cleavage and formation to give a MeC5H4 unit, and insertion of a Ti atom into the MeC5H4 unit with release of H2 to give a metallacycle product. The C\xe2\x80\x93C bond cleavage and ring contraction of toluene can also occur in a similar fashion, though some details are different due to the presence of the methyl substituent. Obviously, the facile release of H2 from the metal hydride cluster to provide electrons and to alter the charge population at the metal centers, in combination with the flexible metal\xe2\x80\x93hydride connections and dynamic redox behavior of the trimetallic framework, has enabled this unusual transformation to occur. This work has not only provided unprecedented insights into the activation and transformation of benzene over a multimetallic framework but it may also offer help in the design of new molecular catalysts for the activation and transformation of inactive aromatics."
"Wet conditions in heterogeneous catalysis can substantially improve the rate of surface reactions by assisting the diffusion of reaction intermediates between surface reaction sites. The atomistic mechanisms underpinning this accelerated mass transfer are, however, concealed by the complexity of the dynamic water/solid interface. Here we employ ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to disclose the fast diffusion of protons and hydroxide species along the interface between water and ceria, a catalytically important, highly reducible oxide. Up to 20% of the interfacial water molecules are shown to dissociate at room temperature via proton transfer to surface O atoms, leading to partial surface hydroxylation and to a local increase of hydroxide species in the surface solvation layer. A water-mediated Grotthus-like mechanism is shown to activate the fast and long-range proton diffusion at the water/oxide interface. We demonstrate the catalytic importance of this dynamic process for water dissociation at ceria-supported Pt nanoparticles, where the solvent accelerates the spillover of ad-species between oxide and metal sites."
"The concept of tandem catalysis, where sequential reactions catalyzed by different interfaces in single nanostructure give desirable product selectively, has previously been applied effectively in the production of propanal from methanol (via carbon monoxide and hydrogen) and ethylene via tandem hydroformylation. However, the underlying mechanism leading to enhanced product selectivity has remained elusive due to the lack of stable, well-defined catalyst suitable for in-depth comprehensive study. Accordingly, we present the design and synthesis of a three-dimensional (3D) catalyst CeO2\xe2\x80\x93Pt@mSiO2 with well-defined metal\xe2\x80\x93oxide interfaces and stable architecture and investigate the selective conversion of ethylene to propanal via tandem hydroformylation. The effective production of aldehyde through the tandem hydroformylation was also observed on propylene and 1-butene. A thorough study of the CeO2\xe2\x80\x93Pt@mSiO2 under different reaction and control conditions reveals that the ethylene present for the hydroformylation step slows down initial methanol decomposition, preventing the accumulation of hydrogen (H2) and favoring propanal formation to achieve up to 80% selectivity. The selectivity is also promoted by the fact that the reaction intermediates produced from methanol decomposition are poised to directly undergo hydroformylation upon migration from one catalytic interface to another. This synergistic effect between the two sequential reactions and the corresponding altered reaction pathway, compared to the single-step reaction, constitute the key advantages of this tandem catalysis. Ultimately, this in-depth study unravels the principles of tandem catalysis related to hydroformylation and represents a key step toward the rational design of new heterogeneous catalysts."
"Technologies that can visualize, capture, and identify subsets of biomolecules that are not encoded by the genome in the context of healthy and diseased cells will offer unique opportunities to uncover the molecular mechanism of a multitude of physiological and disease processes. We describe here a chemical reporter strategy for labeling of cell surface glycoconjugates that takes advantage of recombinant glycosyltransferases and a corresponding sugar nucleotide functionalized by biotin. The exceptional efficiency of this method, termed one-step selective exoenzymatic labeling, or SEEL, greatly improved the ability to enrich and identify large numbers of tagged glycoproteins by LC\xe2\x80\x93MS/MS. We further demonstrated that this labeling method resulted in far superior enrichment and detection of glycoproteins at the plasma membrane compared to a sulfo-NHS-activated biotinylation or two-step SEEL. This new methodology will make it possible to profile cell surface glycoproteomes with unprecedented sensitivity in the context of physiological and disease states."
"G protein-coupled receptors constitute the largest family of transmembrane signaling proteins and the largest pool of drug targets, yet their mechanism of action remains obscure. That uncertainty relates to unresolved questions regarding the supramolecular nature of the signaling complex formed by receptor and G protein. We therefore have characterized the oligomeric status of eGFP-tagged M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R) and Gi1 by single-particle photobleaching of immobilized complexes. The method was calibrated with multiplexed controls comprising 1\xe2\x80\x934 copies of fused eGFP. The photobleaching patterns of eGFP-M2R were indicative of a tetramer and unaffected by muscarinic ligands; those of eGFP-Gi1 were indicative of a hexamer and unaffected by GTP\xce\xb3S. A complex of M2R and Gi1 was tetrameric in both, and activation by a full agonist plus GTP\xce\xb3S reduced the oligomeric size of Gi1 without affecting that of the receptor. A similar reduction was observed upon activation of eGFP-G\xce\xb1i1 by the receptor-mimic mastoparan plus GTP\xce\xb3S, and constitutively active eGFP-G\xce\xb1i1 was predominantly dimeric. The oligomeric nature of Gi1 in live CHO cells was demonstrated by means of F\xc3\xb6rster resonance energy transfer and dual-color fluorescence correlation spectroscopy in studies with eGFP- and mCherry-labeled G\xce\xb1i1; stochastic FRET was ruled out by means of non-interacting pairs. These results suggest that the complex between M2R and holo-Gi1 is an octamer comprising four copies of each, and that activation is accompanied by a decrease in the oligomeric size of Gi1. The structural feasibility of such a complex was demonstrated in molecular dynamics simulations."
"Energy transfer dynamics in monomer and dimer of the photosystem II core complex (PSII-CC) was investigated by means of femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. There is no profound difference between the TA dynamics of the monomer and the dimer in the weak excitation intensity condition (\xe2\x89\xa421 nJ). However, the fast recovery of the ground state bleach was pronounced at higher excitation intensities, and the excitation intensity dependence of the dimer was more significant than that of the monomer. This result indicates efficient exciton\xe2\x80\x93exciton annihilation taking place in the dimer due to energy transfer between the two monomer units. The annihilation dynamics was reproduced by a simple model based on binomial theorem, which indicated that although PSII-CC dimer has two reaction centers, only one charge-separated state remained after annihilation."
"A novel class of dibenzo-fused 1,9-diaza-9a-boraphenalenes featuring zigzag edges with a nitrogen\xe2\x80\x93boron\xe2\x80\x93nitrogen bonding pattern named NBN-dibenzophenalenes (NBN-DBPs) has been synthesized. Alternating nitrogen and boron atoms impart high chemical stability to these zigzag-edged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and this motif even allows for postsynthetic modifications, as demonstrated here through electrophilic bromination and subsequent palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Upon oxidation, as a typical example, NBN-DBP 5a was nearly quantitatively converted to \xcf\x83-dimer 5a-2 through an open-shell intermediate, as indicated by UV\xe2\x80\x93vis\xe2\x80\x93NIR absorption spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy corroborated by spectroscopic calculations, as well as 2D NMR spectra analyses. In situ spectroelectrochemistry was used to confirm the formation process of the dimer radical cation 5a-2\xe2\x80\xa2+. Finally, the developed new synthetic strategy could also be applied to obtain \xcf\x80-extended NBN-dibenzoheptazethrene (NBN-DBHZ), representing an efficient pathway toward NBN-doped zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons."
"When exposed to intense sunlight, all organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis implement various photoprotective strategies to prevent potentially lethal photodamage. The rapidly responding photoprotective mechanisms, occurring in the light-harvesting pigment\xe2\x80\x93protein antennae, take effect within tens of seconds, while the dramatic and potentially harmful light intensity fluctuations manifest also on shorter time scales. Here we show that, upon illumination, individual phycobilisomes from Synechocystis PCC 6803, which, in vivo under low-light conditions, harvest solar energy, and have the built-in capacity to switch rapidly and reversibly into light-activated energy-dissipating states. Simultaneously measured fluorescence intensity, lifetime, and spectra, compared with a multicompartmental kinetic model, revealed that essentially any subunit of a phycobilisome can be quenched, and that the core complexes were targeted most frequently. Our results provide the first evidence for fluorescence blinking from a biologically active system at physiological light intensities and suggest that the light-controlled switches to intrinsically available energy-dissipating states are responsible for a novel type of photoprotection in cyanobacteria. We anticipate other photosynthetic organisms to employ similar strategies to respond instantly to rapid solar light intensity fluctuations. A detailed understanding of the photophysics of photosynthetic antenna complexes is of great interest for bioinspired solar energy technologies."
"The coffee-ring effect denotes the accumulation of particles at the edge of an evaporating sessile drop pinned on a substrate. Because it can be detected by simple visual inspection, this ubiquitous phenomenon can be envisioned as a robust and cost-effective diagnostic tool. Toward this direction, here we systematically analyze the deposit morphology of drying drops containing polystyrene particles of different surface properties with various proteins (bovine serum albumin (BSA) and different forms of hemoglobin). We show that deposit patterns reveal information on both the adsorption of proteins onto particles and their reorganization following adsorption. By combining pattern analysis with adsorption isotherm and zeta potential measurements, we show that the suppression of the coffee-ring effect and the formation of a disk-shaped pattern is primarily associated with particle neutralization by protein adsorption. However, our findings also suggest that protein reorganization following adsorption can dramatically invert this tendency. Exposure of hydrophobic (respectively charged) residues can lead to disk (respectively ring) deposit morphologies independently of the global particle charge. Surface tension measurements and microscopic observations of the evaporating drops show that the determinant factor of the deposit morphology is the accumulation of particles at the liquid/gas interface during evaporation. This general behavior opens the possibility to probe protein adsorption and reorganization on particles by the analysis of the deposit patterns, the formation of a disk being the robust signature of particles rendered hydrophobic by protein adsorption. We show that this method is sensitive enough to detect a single point mutation in a protein, as demonstrated here by the distinct patterns formed by human native hemoglobin h-HbA and its mutant form h-HbS, which is responsible for sickle cell anemia."
"Characterizing the nanoscale dynamic organization within lipid bilayer membranes is central to our understanding of cell membranes at a molecular level. We investigate phase separation and communication across leaflets in ternary lipid bilayers, including saturated lipids with between 12 and 20 carbons per tail. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal a novel two-step kinetics due to hydrophobic mismatch, in which the initial response of the apposed leaflets upon quenching is to increase local asymmetry (antiregistration), followed by dominance of symmetry (registration) as the bilayer equilibrates. Antiregistration can become thermodynamically preferred if domain size is restricted below \xe2\x88\xbc20 nm, with implications for the symmetry of rafts and nanoclusters in cell membranes, which have similar reported sizes. We relate our findings to theory derived from a semimicroscopic model in which the leaflets experience a \xe2\x80\x9cdirect\xe2\x80\x9d area-dependent coupling, and an \xe2\x80\x9cindirect\xe2\x80\x9d coupling that arises from hydrophobic mismatch and is most important at domain boundaries. Registered phases differ in composition from antiregistered phases, consistent with a direct coupling between the leaflets. Increased hydrophobic mismatch purifies the phases, suggesting that it contributes to the molecule-level lipid immiscibility. Our results demonstrate an interplay of competing interleaflet couplings that affect phase compositions and kinetics, and lead to a length scale that can influence lateral and transverse bilayer organization within cells."
"Herein, we report an alkali metal cation-dependent approach to gold recovery, facilitated by second-sphere coordination with eco-friendly \xce\xb1-cyclodextrin (\xce\xb1-CD). Upon mixing eight salts composed of Na+, K+, Rb+, or Cs+ cations and [AuX4]\xe2\x88\x92 (X = Cl/Br) anions with \xce\xb1-, \xce\xb2-, or \xce\xb3-CD in water, co-precipitates form selectively from the three (out of 24) aqueous solutions containing \xce\xb1-CD with KAuBr4, RbAuBr4, and CsAuBr4, from which the combination of \xce\xb1-CD and KAuBr4 affords the highest yield. Single-crystal X-ray analyses reveal that in 20 of the 24 adducts CD and [AuX4]\xe2\x88\x92 anions form 2:1 sandwich-type second-sphere adducts driven partially by [C\xe2\x80\x93H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7X\xe2\x80\x93Au] interactions between [AuX4]\xe2\x88\x92 anions and the primary faces of two neighboring CDs. In the adduct formed between \xce\xb1-CD and KAuBr4, a [K(OH2)6]+ cation is encapsulated inside the cavity between the secondary faces of two \xce\xb1-CDs, leading to highly efficient precipitation owing to the formation of a cation/anion alternating ion wire residing inside a continuous \xce\xb1-CD nanotube. By contrast, in the other 19 adducts, the cations are coordinated by OH groups and glucopyranosyl ring O atoms in CDs. The strong coordination of Rb+ and Cs+ cations by these ligands, in conjunction with the stereoelectronically favorable binding of [AuBr4]\xe2\x88\x92 anions with two \xce\xb1-CDs, facilitates the co-precipitation of the two adducts formed between \xce\xb1-CD with RbAuBr4 and CsAuBr4. In order to develop an efficient process for green gold recovery, the co-precipitation yield of \xce\xb1-CD and KAuBr4 has been optimized regarding both the temperature and the molar ratio of \xce\xb1-CD to KAuBr4."
"The development of active, robust systems for light-driven hydrogen production from aqueous protons based on catalysts and light absorbers composed solely of earth abundant elements remains a challenge in the development of an artificial photosynthetic system for water splitting. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of four closely related Fe bis(benzenedithiolate) complexes that exhibit catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution when employed in systems with water-soluble CdSe QDs as photosensitizer and ascorbic acid as a sacrificial electron source under visible light irradiation (520 nm). The complex with the most electron-donating dithiolene ligand exhibits the highest activity, the overall order of activity correlating with the reduction potential of the formally Fe(III) dimeric dianions. Detailed studies of the effect of different capping agents and the extent of surface coverage of these capping agents on the CdSe QD surfaces reveal that they affect system activity and provide insight into the continued development of such systems containing QD light absorbers and molecular catalysts for H2 formation."
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in controlling various cellular processes, and the expression levels of individual miRNAs can be considerably altered in pathological conditions such as cancer. Accurate quantification of miRNA at the single-cell level will lead to a better understanding of miRNA function. Here, we present a direct and sensitive method for miRNA detection using atomic force microscopy (AFM). A hybrid binding domain (HBD)-tethered tip enabled mature miRNAs, but not premature miRNAs, to be located individually on an adhesion force map. By scanning several sections of a micrometer-sized DNA spot, we were able to quantify the copy number of miR-134 in a single neuron and demonstrate that the expression was increased upon cell activation. Moreover, we visualized individual miR-134s on fixed neurons after membrane removal and observed 2\xe2\x80\x934 miR-134s in the area of 1.0 \xc3\x97 1.0 \xce\xbcm2 of soma. The number increased to 8\xe2\x80\x9314 in stimulated neurons, and this change matches the ensemble-averaged increase in copy number. These findings indicate that miRNAs can be reliably quantified at the single cell level with AFM and that their distribution can be mapped at nanometric lateral resolution without modification or amplification. Furthermore, the analysis of miRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins in the same sample or region by scanning sequentially with different AFM tips would let us accurately understand the post-transcriptional regulation of biological processes."
"In solar energy harvesting devices based on molecular semiconductors, such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and artificial photosynthetic systems, Frenkel excitons must be dissociated via charge transfer at heterojunctions to yield free charges. What controls the rate and efficiency of charge transfer and charge separation is an important question, as it determines the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these systems. In bulk heterojunctions between polymer donor and fullerene acceptors, which provide a model system to understand the fundamental dynamics of electron transfer in molecular systems, it has been established that the first step of photoinduced electron transfer can be fast, of order 100 fs. But here we report the first study which correlates differences in the electron transfer rate with electronic structure and morphology, achieved with sub-20 fs time resolution pump\xe2\x80\x93probe spectroscopy. We vary both the fullerene substitution and donor/fullerene ratio which allow us to control both aggregate size and the energetic driving force for charge transfer. We observe a range of electron transfer times from polymer to fullerene, from 240 fs to as short as 37 fs. Using ultrafast electro-optical pump-push-photocurrent spectroscopy, we find the yield of free versus bound charges to be weakly dependent on the energetic driving force, but to be very strongly dependent on fullerene aggregate size and packing. Our results point toward the importance of state accessibility and charge delocalization and suggest that energetic offsets between donor and acceptor levels are not an important criterion for efficient charge generation. This provides design rules for next-generation materials to minimize losses related to driving energy and boost PCE."
"Because Mycobacterium bovis, termed bacillus Calmette\xe2\x80\x93Gu\xc3\xa9rin (BCG), the only available used tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, retains immunomodulatory properties that limit its protective immunogenicity, there are continuous efforts to identify the immunosuppression mechanism as well as new strategies for improving the immunogenicity of BCG. Here, an ssDNA aptamer \xe2\x80\x9cantibody\xe2\x80\x9d BM2 specifically bound to the mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) of BCG was selected. BM2 significantly blocked ManLAM\xe2\x80\x93mannose receptor (MR) binding, triggered ManLAM\xe2\x80\x93CD44 signaling, and enhanced M1 macrophage and Th1 activation via cellular surface CD44 in vitro and in vivo. BM2 enhanced immunoprotective effects of BCG against virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv infection in mice and monkeys models. Thus, we report a new mechanism of the interaction between ManLAM and CD44 on macrophages and CD4+ T cells and reveal that ManLAM-binding membrane molecule CD44 is a novel target for the enhancement of BCG immunogenicity, and BM2 has strong potential as an immune enhancer for BCG."
"The lasonolides are novel polyketides that have displayed remarkable biological activity in vitro against a variety of cancer cell lines. Herein we describe our first-generation approach to the formal synthesis of lasonolide A. The key findings from these studies ultimately allowed us to go on and complete a total synthesis of lasonolide A. The convergent approach unites two highly complex fragments utilizing a Ru-catalyzed alkene\xe2\x80\x93alkyne coupling. This type of coupling typically generates branched products; however, through a detailed investigation, we are now able to demonstrate that subtle structural changes to the substrates can alter the selectivity to favor the formation of the linear product. The synthesis of the fragments features a number of atom-economical transformations which are highlighted by the discovery of an engineered enzyme to perform a dynamic kinetic reduction of a \xce\xb2-ketoester to establish the absolute stereochemistry of the southern tetrahydropyran ring with high levels of enantioselectivity."
"Chemical denaturants are the most commonly used agents for unfolding proteins and are thought to act by better solvating the unfolded state. Improved solvation is expected to lead to an expansion of unfolded chains with increasing denaturant concentration, providing a sensitive probe of the denaturant action. However, experiments have so far yielded qualitatively different results concerning the effects of chemical denaturation. Studies using F\xc3\xb6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and other methods found an increase in radius of gyration with denaturant concentration, but most small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies found no change. This discrepancy therefore challenges our understanding of denaturation mechanism and more generally the accuracy of these experiments as applied to unfolded or disordered proteins. Here, we use all-atom molecular simulations to investigate the effect of urea and guanidinium chloride on the structure of the intrinsically disordered protein ACTR, which can be studied by experiment over a wide range of denaturant concentration. Using unbiased molecular simulations with a carefully calibrated denaturant model, we find that the protein chain indeed swells with increasing denaturant concentration. This is due to the favorable association of urea or guanidinium chloride with the backbone of all residues and with the side-chains of almost all residues, with denaturant\xe2\x80\x93water transfer free energies inferred from this association in reasonable accord with experimental estimates. Interactions of the denaturants with the backbone are dominated by hydrogen bonding, while interactions with side-chains include other contributions. By computing FRET efficiencies and SAXS intensities at each denaturant concentration, we show that the simulation trajectories are in accord with both experiments on this protein, demonstrating that there is no fundamental inconsistency between the two types of experiment. Agreement with experiment also supports the picture of chemical denaturation described in our simulations, driven by weak association of denaturant with the protein. Our simulations support some assumptions needed for each experiment to accurately reflect changes in protein size, namely, that the commonly used FRET chromophores do not qualitatively alter the results and that possible effects such as preferential solvent partitioning into the interior of the chain do not interfere with the determination of radius of gyration from the SAXS experiments."
"There has been a long-standing controversy regarding the effect of chemical denaturants on the dimensions of unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins: A wide range of experimental techniques suggest that polypeptide chains expand with increasing denaturant concentration, but several studies using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) have reported no such increase of the radius of gyration (Rg). This inconsistency challenges our current understanding of the mechanism of chemical denaturants, which are widely employed to investigate protein folding and stability. Here, we use a combination of single-molecule F\xc3\xb6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), SAXS, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and two-focus fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (2f-FCS) to characterize the denaturant dependence of the unfolded state of the spectrin domain R17 and the intrinsically disordered protein ACTR in two different denaturants. Standard analysis of the primary data clearly indicates an expansion of the unfolded state with increasing denaturant concentration irrespective of the protein, denaturant, or experimental method used. This is the first case in which SAXS and FRET have yielded even qualitatively consistent results regarding expansion in denaturant when applied to the same proteins. To more directly illustrate this self-consistency, we  used both SAXS and FRET data in a Bayesian procedure to refine structural ensembles representative of the observed unfolded state. This analysis demonstrates that both of these experimental probes are compatible with a common ensemble of protein configurations for each denaturant concentration. Furthermore, the resulting ensembles reproduce the trend of increasing hydrodynamic radius with denaturant concentration obtained by 2f-FCS and DLS. We were thus able to reconcile the results from all four experimental techniques quantitatively, to obtain a comprehensive structural picture of denaturant-induced unfolded state expansion, and to identify the most likely sources of earlier discrepancies."
"Tailoring structurally anisotropic molecular assemblies while controlling their orientation on solid substrates is an important subject for advanced technologies that use organic thin films. Here we report a supramolecular scaffold based on tripodal triptycene assemblies, which enables functional molecular units to assemble into a highly oriented, multilayered two-dimensional (2D) structure on solid substrates. The triptycene building block carries an ethynyl group and three flexible side chains at the 10- and 1,8,13-positions, respectively. These bridgehead-substituted tripodal triptycenes self-assembled on solid substrates to form a well-defined \xe2\x80\x9c2D hexagonal + 1D lamellar\xe2\x80\x9d structure, which developed parallel to the surface of the substrates. Remarkably, the assembling properties of the triptycene building blocks, particularly for a derivative with tri(oxyethylene)-containing side chains, were not impaired when the alkyne terminal was functionalized with a large molecular unit such as C60, which is comparable in diameter to the triptycene framework. Consequently, thin films with a multilayered 2D assembly of the C60 unit were obtained. Flash-photolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity (FP-TRMC) measurements revealed that the C60 film exhibits highly anisotropic charge-transport properties. Bridgehead-substituted tripodal triptycenes may provide a versatile supramolecular scaffold for tailoring the 2D assembly of molecular units into a highly oriented thin film, and in turn for exploiting the full potential of anisotropic molecular functions."
"Polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) offers a highly versatile and efficient route to a wide range of organic nanoparticles. In this article, we demonstrate for the first time that poly(ammonium 2-sulfatoethyl methacrylate)-poly(benzyl methacrylate) [PSEM\xe2\x80\x93PBzMA] diblock copolymer nanoparticles can be prepared with either a high or low PSEM stabilizer surface density using either RAFT dispersion polymerization in a 2:1 v/v ethanol/water mixture or RAFT aqueous emulsion polymerization, respectively. We then use these model nanoparticles to gain new insight into a key topic in materials chemistry: the occlusion of organic additives into inorganic crystals. Substantial differences are observed for the extent of occlusion of these two types of anionic nanoparticles into calcite (CaCO3), which serves as a suitable model host crystal. A low PSEM stabilizer surface density leads to uniform nanoparticle occlusion within calcite at up to 7.5% w/w (16% v/v), while minimal occlusion occurs when using nanoparticles with a high PSEM stabilizer surface density. This counter-intuitive observation suggests that an optimum anionic surface density is required for efficient occlusion, which provides a hitherto unexpected design rule for the incorporation of nanoparticles within crystals."
"Two-dimensional chirality transfer from self-assembled (SA) molecules to covalently bonded products was achieved via on-surface synthesis on Au(111) substrates by choosing 1,4-dibromo-2,5-didodecylbenzene (12DB) and 1,4-dibromo-2,5-ditridecylbenzene (13DB) as designed precursors. Scanning tunneling microscopy investigations reveal that their aryl\xe2\x80\x93aryl coupling reaction occurs by connecting the nearest neighboring precursors and thus preserving the SA lamellar structure. The SA structures of 12(13)DB precursors determine the final structures of produced oligo-p-phenylenes (OPP) on the surface. Pure homochiral domains (12DB) give rise to homochiral domains of OPP, whereas lamellae containing mixed chiral geometry of the precursor (13DB) results in the formation of racemic lamellae of OPP."
"Singlet fission (SF) in polycrystalline thin films of four 3,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) chromophores with methyl (Me), n-hexyl (C6), triethylene glycol (TEG), and 2-ethylhexyl (EH) substituents at the 2,5-positions is found to involve an intermediate excimer-like state. The four different substituents yield four distinct intermolecular packing geometries, resulting in variable intermolecular charge transfer (CT) interactions in the solid. SF from the excimer state of Me, C6, TEG, and EH takes place in \xcf\x84SF = 22, 336, 195, and 1200 ps, respectively, to give triplet yields of 200%, 110%, 110%, and 70%, respectively. The transient spectra of the excimer-like state and its energetic proximity to the lowest excited singlet state in these derivatives suggests that this state may be the multiexciton 1(T1T1) state that precedes formation of the uncorrelated triplet excitons. The excimer decay rates correlate well with the SF efficiencies and the degree of intermolecular donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor interactions resulting from \xcf\x80-stacking of the thiophene donor of one molecule with the DPP core acceptor in another molecule as observed in the crystal structures. Such interactions are found to also increase with the SF coupling energies, as calculated for each derivative. These structural and spectroscopic studies afford a better understanding of the electronic interactions that enhance SF in chromophores having strong intra- and intermolecular CT character."
"Coupling among chromophores in molecular assemblies is responsible for phenomena such as resonant energy transfer and intermolecular charge transfer. These processes are central to the fields of organic photovoltaics and photocatalysis, where it is necessary to funnel energy or charge to specific regions within the system. As such, a fundamental understanding of these transport processes is essential for developing new materials for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications. Recently, photocatalytic systems based on photosensitizing perylene monomimide (PMI) chromophore amphiphiles were found to show variation in hydrogen gas (H2) production as a function of nanostructure crystallinity. The 2D crystalline systems form in aqueous electrolyte solution, which provides a high dielectric environment where the Coulomb potential between charges is mitigated. This results in relatively weakly bound excitons that are ideal for reducing protons. In order to understand how variations in crystalline structure affect H2 generation, two representative PMI systems are investigated theoretically using a modified Holstein Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian includes both molecular Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge-transfer excitations (CTE) coupled nonadiabatically to local intramolecular vibrations. Signatures of FE/CTE mixing and the extent of electron/hole separation are identified in the optical absorption spectrum and are found to correlate strongly to the observed H2 production rates. The absorption spectral signatures are found to sensitively depend on the relative phase between the electron and hole transfer integrals, as well as the diabatic energy difference between the Frenkel and CT exciton bands. Our analysis provides design rules for artificial photosynthetic systems based on organic chromophore arrays."
"Although native chemical ligation (NCL) and related chemoselective ligation approaches provide an elegant method to stitch together unprotected peptides, the handling and purification of insoluble and aggregation-prone peptides and assembly intermediates create a bottleneck to routinely preparing large proteins by completely synthetic means. In this work, we introduce a new general tool, Fmoc-Ddae-OH, N-Fmoc-1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclo-hexylidene)-3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]-propan-1-ol, a heterobifunctional traceless linker for temporarily attaching highly solubilizing peptide sequences (\xe2\x80\x9chelping hands\xe2\x80\x9d) onto insoluble peptides. This tool is implemented in three simple and nearly quantitative steps: (i) on-resin incorporation of the linker at a Lys residue \xce\xb5-amine, (ii) Fmoc-SPPS elongation of a desired solubilizing sequence, and (iii) in-solution removal of the solubilizing sequence using mild aqueous hydrazine to cleave the Ddae linker after NCL-based assembly. Successful introduction and removal of a Lys6 helping hand is first demonstrated in two model systems (Ebola virus C20 peptide and the 70-residue ribosomal protein L31). It is then applied to the challenging chemical synthesis of the 97-residue co-chaperonin GroES, which contains a highly insoluble C-terminal segment that is rescued by a helping hand. Importantly, the Ddae linker can be cleaved in one pot following NCL or desulfurization. The purity, structure, and chaperone activity of synthetic l-GroES were validated with respect to a recombinant control. Additionally, the helping hand enabled synthesis of d-GroES, which was inactive in a heterochiral mixture with recombinant GroEL, providing additional insight into chaperone specificity. Ultimately, this simple, robust, and easy-to-use tool is expected to be broadly applicable for the synthesis of challenging peptides and proteins."
"Constitutional dynamic libraries (CDLs) of hydrazones, acylhydrazones, and imines undergo reorganization and adaptation in response to chemical effectors (herein metal cations) via component exchange and selection. Such CDLs can be subjected to training by exposition to given effectors and keep memory of the information stored by interaction with a specific metal ion. The long-term storage of the acquired information into the set of constituents of the system allows for fast recognition on subsequent contacts with the same effector(s). Dynamic networks of constituents were designed to adapt orthogonally to different metal cations by up- and down-regulation of specific constituents in the final distribution. The memory may be erased by component exchange between the constituents so as to regenerate the initial (statistical) distribution. The libraries described represent constitutional dynamic systems capable of acting as information storage molecular devices, in which the presence of components linked by reversible covalent bonds in slow exchange and bearing adequate coordination sites allows for the adaptation to different metal ions by constitutional variation. The system thus performs information storage, recall, and erase processes."
"Despite its important role in biology and nanotechnology, many questions remain regarding the molecular mechanism and dynamics by which oligonucleotides recognize and hybridize to their complementary sequence. The thermodynamics and kinetics of DNA oligonucleotide hybridization and dehybridization are often assumed to involve an all-or-nothing two-state dissociation pathway, but deviations from this behavior can be considerable even for short sequences. We introduce a new strategy to characterize the base-pair-specific thermal dissociation mechanism of DNA oligonucleotides through steady-state and time-resolved infrared spectroscopy. Experiments are interpreted with a lattice model to provide a structure-specific interpretation. This method is applied to a model set of self-complementary 10-base-pair sequences in which the placement of GC base pairs is varied in an otherwise AT strand. Through a combination of Fourier transform infrared and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, experiments reveal varying degrees of deviation from simple two-state behavior. As the temperature is increased, duplexes dissociate through a path in which the terminal bases fray, without any significant contribution from loop configurations. Transient temperature jump experiments reveal time scales of 70\xe2\x80\x93100 ns for fraying and 10\xe2\x80\x9330 \xce\xbcs for complete dissociation near the melting temperature. Whether or not frayed states are metastable intermediates or short-lived configurations during the full dissociation of the duplex is dictated by the nucleobase sequence."
"The enzyme NadA catalyzes the synthesis of quinolinic acid (QA), the precursor of the universal nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) cofactor. Here, we report the crystal structures of complexes between the Thermotoga maritima (Tm) NadA K219R/Y107F variant and (i) the first intermediate (W) resulting from the condensation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) with iminoaspartate and (ii) the DHAP analogue and triose-phosphate isomerase inhibitor phosphoglycolohydroxamate (PGH). In addition, using the TmNadA K219R/Y21F variant, we have reacted substrates and obtained a crystalline complex between this protein and the QA product. We also show that citrate can bind to both TmNadA K219R and its Y21F variant. The W structure indicates that condensation causes dephosphorylation. We propose that catalysis by the K219R/Y107F variant is arrested at the W intermediate because the mutated protein is unable to catalyze its aldo\xe2\x80\x93keto isomerization and/or cyclization that ultimately lead to QA formation. Intriguingly, PGH binds to NadA with its phosphate group at the site where the carboxylate groups of W also bind. Our results shed significant light on the mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by NadA."
"Thermal storage, a technology that enables us to control thermal energy, makes it possible to reuse a huge amount of waste heat, and materials with the ability to treat larger thermal energy are in high demand for energy-saving societies. Sugar alcohols are now one promising candidate for phase change materials (PCMs) because of their large thermal storage density. In this study, we computationally design experimentally unknown non-natural sugar alcohols and predict their thermal storage density as a basic step toward the development of new high performance PCMs. The non-natural sugar alcohol molecules are constructed in silico in accordance with the previously suggested molecular design guidelines: linear elongation of a carbon backbone, separated distribution of OH groups, and even numbers of carbon atoms. Their crystal structures are then predicted using the random search method and first-principles calculations. Our molecular simulation results clearly demonstrate that the non-natural sugar alcohols have potential ability to have thermal storage density up to \xe2\x88\xbc450\xe2\x80\x93500 kJ/kg, which is significantly larger than the maximum thermal storage density of the present known organic PCMs (\xe2\x88\xbc350 kJ/kg). This computational study suggests that, even in the case of H-bonded molecular crystals where the electrostatic energy contributes mainly to thermal storage density, the molecular distortion and van der Waals energies are also important factors to increase thermal storage density. In addition, the comparison between the three eight-carbon non-natural sugar alcohol isomers indicates that the selection of preferable isomers is also essential for large thermal storage density."
"Stable s2 lone pair electrons on heavy main-group elements in their lower oxidation states drive a range of important phenomena, such as the emergence of polar ground states in some ferroic materials. Here we study the perovskite halide CsSnBr3 as an embodiment of the broader materials class. We show that lone pair stereochemical activity due to the Sn2+ s2 lone pair causes a crystallographically hidden, locally distorted state to appear upon warming, a phenomenon previously referred to as emphanisis. The synchrotron X-ray pair distribution function acquired between 300 and 420 K reveals emerging asymmetry in the nearest-neighbor Sn\xe2\x80\x93Br correlations, consistent with dynamic Sn2+ off-centering, despite there being no evidence of any deviation from the average cubic structure. Computation based on density functional theory supports the finding of a lattice instability associated with dynamic off-centering of Sn2+ in its coordination environment. Photoluminescence measurements reveal an unusual blue-shift with increasing temperature, closely linked to the structural evolution. At low temperatures, the structures reflect the influence of octahedral rotation. A continuous transition from an orthorhombic structure (Pnma, no. 62) to a tetragonal structure (P4/mbm, no. 127) is found around 250 K, with a final, first-order transformation at 286 K to the cubic structure (Pm3\xcc\x85m, no. 221)."
"In this paper, an electron donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor (D-A) substituted dipolar chromophore (BTPA-TCNE) is developed to serve as an efficient dopant-free hole-transporting material (HTM) for perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). BTPA-TCNE is synthesized via a simple reaction between a triphenylamine-based Michler\xe2\x80\x99s base and tetracyanoethylene. This chromophore possesses a zwitterionic resonance structure in the ground state, as evidenced by X-ray crystallography and transient absorption spectroscopies. Moreover, BTPA-TCNE shows an antiparallel molecular packing (i.e., centrosymmetric dimers) in its crystalline state, which cancels out its overall molecular dipole moment to facilitate charge transport. As a result, BTPA-TCNE can be employed as an effective dopant-free HTM to realize an efficient (PCE \xe2\x89\x88 17.0%) PVSC in the conventional n-i-p configuration, outperforming the control device with doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM."
"Ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of various cyclic olefins especially using three (arylimido)vanadium(V)-alkylidene catalysts, V(CHSiMe3)(N-2,6-Cl2C6H3) (OC6F5) (PMe3)2 (3), V(CHSiMe3) (NR)[OC(CF3)3](PMe3)2 [R = Ph (6), 2,6-Cl2C6H3 (7)] have been explored. Complex 3 exhibited the highest catalytic activity (ex. TOF = 603\xe2\x80\xaf000 h\xe2\x80\x931, 168 s\xe2\x80\x931) for ROMP of norbornene (NBE) among a series of (imido)vanadium(V)-alkylidenes, and the cis-specific living ROMPs of NBE proceeded with remarkable activities (TOF = 125\xe2\x80\xaf000\xe2\x80\x93157\xe2\x80\xaf000 h\xe2\x80\x931 at 25 \xc2\xb0C) by the fluorinated alkoxo analogues (6, 7). The activities by 6, 7 increased at high temperature (50 and 80 \xc2\xb0C) and/or upon addition of PMe3 without decrease in the cis selectivity (98%). The ROMPs in the presence of 1-hexene by 3, 7 proceeded without significant decrease in the activities, and the Mn values could be controlled by degree of chain transfer (cross metathesis). These dichlorophenylimido analogues (3, 7) were effective for ROMPs of various norbornene derivatives; ROMP of cyclooctene took place by 3, and the activity increased at high temperature (50, 80 \xc2\xb0C)."
"Hepatitis C virus (HCV), affecting an estimated 150 million people worldwide, is the leading cause of viral hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV is genetically diverse with six genotypes (GTs) and multiple subtypes of different global distribution and prevalence. Recent development of direct-acting antivirals against HCV including NS3/4A protease inhibitors (PIs) has greatly improved treatment outcomes for GT-1. However, all current PIs exhibit significantly lower potency against GT-3. Lack of structural data on GT-3 protease has limited our ability to understand PI failure in GT-3. In this study the molecular basis for reduced potency of current inhibitors against GT-3 NS3/4A protease is elucidated with structure determination, molecular dynamics simulations and inhibition assays. A chimeric GT-1a3a NS3/4A protease amenable to crystallization was engineered to recapitulate decreased sensitivity of GT-3 protease to PIs. High-resolution crystal structures of this GT-1a3a bound to 3 PIs, asunaprevir, danoprevir and vaniprevir, had only subtle differences relative to GT-1 despite orders of magnitude loss in affinity. In contrast, hydrogen-bonding interactions within and with the protease active site and dynamic fluctuations of the PIs were drastically altered. The correlation between loss of intermolecular dynamics and inhibitor potency suggests a mechanism where polymorphisms between genotypes (or selected mutations) in the drug target confer resistance through altering the intermolecular dynamics of the protein\xe2\x80\x93inhibitor complex."
"The cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction of N-aryltetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQ) is one of the most exploited photocatalytic transformation and a test reaction for an exceptional variety of catalysts. However, its mechanism remained unclear concerning involved intermediates, reactive pathways of the amine radical cation and the influence of oxygen and the light source. Therefore, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron spin resonance (ESR) and synthetic methods were combined to provide a comprehensive picture of the reaction mechanism using Ru(bpy)3Cl2 as a photocatalyst under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The reaction profiles and involved intermediates were monitored and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Several intermediates contributing to product formation were identified, the iminium ion, the hydroperoxide and dimer of THIQ, and a new ring opened intermediate, cleaved at the benzylic C\xe2\x80\x93N bond. Mechanistic evidence is given that under anaerobic conditions preferentially the \xce\xb1-amino radical is formed by deprotonation, in contrast to the formation of iminium ions via H\xe2\x80\xa2-abstraction in the presence of oxygen. Further, the light-induced background reaction in the absence of the catalyst was studied in detail, revealing that the product formation rate is correlated to the intensity and wavelength of the light source and that oxygen is essential for an efficient conversion. The reaction rate and efficiency is comparable to previously reported photocatalytic systems, performed under aerobic conditions in combination with intense blue light sources. Thus, the multitude of reaction parameters investigated reveals the preference for hydrogen atom or proton abstraction in photoreactions and allows to assess the influence of experimental conditions on the mechanistic pathways."
"We report a new methodology for producing monometallic or bimetallic nanoparticles confined within hollow nitrogen-doped porous carbon capsules. The capsules are derived from metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework (MOF) crystals that are coated with a shell of a secondary material comprising either a metal\xe2\x80\x93tannic acid coordination polymer or a resorcinol\xe2\x80\x93formaldehyde polymer. Platinum nanoparticles are optionally sandwiched between the MOF core and the shell. Pyrolysis of the MOF\xe2\x80\x93shell composites produces hollow capsules of porous nitrogen-doped carbon that bear either monometallic (Pt, Co, and Ni) or alloyed (PtCo and PtNi) metal nanoparticles. The Co and Ni components of the bimetallic nanoparticles are derived from the shell surrounding the MOF crystals. The hollow capsules prevent sintering and detachment of the nanoparticles, and their porous walls allow for efficient mass transport. Alloyed PtCo nanoparticles embedded in the capsule walls are highly active, selective, and recyclable catalysts for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes to anilines."
"Phase transitions are ubiquitous in structurally complex transition metal compounds composed of homoanionic polyhedra, including nitrides, oxides, and fluorides. The symmetry breaking that occurs across polymorphic transitions is often achieved by small atomic displacements, rendering these displacive transitions reversible. In contrast, elemental crystals, alloys, and simple minerals will exhibit reconstructive \xe2\x80\x9cbond-breaking\xe2\x80\x9d transitions. Here we show that a reconstructive transition occurs in the heteroanionic compound KNaNbOF5, owing to reorientations of the [NbOF5]2\xe2\x80\x93 units that trigger a reconfiguration of the cation lattice. Using a combination of synchrotron-based measurements, empirical dynamic simulations, and ab initio calculations, we report structure changes across the transition and formulate an atomistic minimum energy transition path to explain its irreversible nature. Our results indicate that multianionic compounds are likely to host reconstructive transitions that are frequently difficult to study and functionalize in simpler compounds. We anticipate that our insight into the forces that drive the transition will also lead to novel methods to control the assembly of structures in the solid state."
"The vibrational Stark effect (VSE) has been used to measure the electric field in the active site of ketosteroid isomerase (KSI). These measured fields correlate with \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 in a series of conventional mutants, yielding an estimate for the electrostatic contribution to catalysis (Fried et al. Science 2014, 346, 1510\xe2\x80\x931513). In this work we test this result with much more conservative variants in which individual Tyr residues in the active site are replaced by 3-chlorotyrosine via amber suppression. The electric fields sensed at the position of the carbonyl bond involved in charge displacement during catalysis were characterized using the VSE, where the field sensitivity has been calibrated by vibrational Stark spectroscopy, solvatochromism, and MD simulations. A linear relationship is observed between the electric field and \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 that interpolates between wild-type and more drastic conventional mutations, reinforcing the evaluation of the electrostatic contribution to catalysis in KSI. A simplified model and calculation are developed to estimate changes in the electric field accompanying changes in the extended hydrogen-bond network in the active site. The results are consistent with a model in which the O\xe2\x80\x93H group of a key active site tyrosine functions by imposing a static electrostatic potential onto the carbonyl bond. The model suggests that the contribution to catalysis from the active site hydrogen bonds is of similar weight to the distal interactions from the rest of the protein. A similar linear correlation was also observed between the proton affinity of KSI\xe2\x80\x99s active site and the catalytic rate, suggesting a direct connection between the strength of the H-bond and the electric field it exerts."
"Control of the spin degree of freedom of an electron has brought about a new era in spin-based applications, particularly spin-based electronics, with the potential to outperform the traditional charge-based semiconductor technology for data storage and information processing. However, the realization of functional spin-based devices for information processing remains elusive due to several fundamental challenges such as the low Curie temperature of group III\xe2\x80\x93V and II\xe2\x80\x93VI semiconductors (<200 K), and the low spin-injection efficiencies of existing III\xe2\x80\x93V, II\xe2\x80\x93VI, and transparent conductive oxide semiconductors in a multilayer device structure, which are caused by precipitation and migration of dopants from the host layer to the adjacent layers. Here, we use catalyst-assisted pulsed laser deposition to grow, for the first time, oxygen vacancy defect-rich, dopant-free ZrO2 nanostructures with high TC (700 K) and high magnetization (5.9 emu/g). The observed magnetization is significantly greater than both doped and defect-rich transparent conductive oxide nanomaterials reported to date. We also provide the first experimental evidence that it is the amounts and types of oxygen vacancy defects in, and not the phase of ZrO2 that control the ferromagnetic order in undoped ZrO2 nanostructures. To explain the origin of ferromagnetism in these ZrO2 nanostructures, we hypothesize a new defect-induced bound polaron model, which is generally applicable to other defect-rich, dopant-free transparent conductive oxide nanostructures. These results provide new insights into magnetic ordering in undoped dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor oxides and contribute to the design of exotic magnetic and novel multifunctional materials."
"The synthesis of a cobalt dihydrogen CoI-(H2) complex prepared from a CoI-(N2) precursor supported by a monoanionic pincer bis(carbene) ligand, MesCCC (MesCCC = bis(mesityl-benzimidazol-2-ylidene)phenyl), is described. This species is capable of H2/D2 scrambling and hydrogenating alkenes at room temperature. Stoichiometric addition of HCl to the CoI-(N2) cleanly affords the CoIII hydridochloride complex, which, upon the addition of Cp2ZrHCl, evolves hydrogen gas and regenerates the CoI-(N2) complex. Furthermore, the catalytic olefin hydrogenation activity of the CoI species was studied by using multinuclear and parahydrogen (p-H2) induced polarization (PHIP) transfer NMR studies to elucidate catalytically relevant intermediates, as well as to establish the role of the CoI-(H2) in the CoI/CoIII redox cycle."
"The regiodivergent Rh-catalyzed hydrothiolation of allyl amines and imines is presented. Bidentate phosphine ligands with larger natural bite angles (\xce\xb2n \xe2\x89\xa5 99\xc2\xb0), for example, DPEphos, dpph, or L1, promote a Markovnikov-selective hydrothiolation in up to 88% yield and >20:1 regioselectivity. Conversely, when smaller bite angle ligands (\xce\xb2n \xe2\x89\xa4 86\xc2\xb0), for example, dppbz or dppp, are employed, the anti-Markovnikov product is formed in up to 74% yield and >20:1 regioselectivity. Initial mechanistic investigations are performed and are consistent with an oxidative addition/olefin insertion/reductive elimination mechanism for each regioisomeric pathway. We hypothesize that the change in regioselectivity is an effect of diverging coordination spheres to favor either Rh\xe2\x80\x93S or Rh\xe2\x80\x93H insertion to form the branched or linear isomer, respectively."
"This Article reports the first comprehensive study of \xce\xb2-hydride elimination at gold(III). The stability/fate of gold(III) alkyl species have been investigated experimentally and computationally. A series of well-defined cationic cyclometalated gold(III) alkyl complexes [(P,C)gold(III)(R)][NTf2] [(P,C) = 8-diisopropylphosphino-naphthyl; R = Me, nPr, nBu] have been synthesized and spectroscopically characterized. While the cationic gold(III) methyl derivative 3c is stable for days at room temperature, the gold(III) n-propyl and n-butyl complexes 3a,b readily undergo \xce\xb2-hydride elimination at low temperature to generate propylene and 2-butenes, respectively. The formation of internal olefins from the gold(III) n-butyl complex 3b shows that olefin isomerization takes place after \xce\xb2-hydride elimination. Computational studies indicate that this isomerization proceeds through a chain-walking mechanism involving a highly reactive gold(III) hydride intermediate and a sequence of \xce\xb2-hydride elimination/reinsertion into the Au\xe2\x80\x93H bond. The reaction of the cationic gold(III) methyl complex 3c with ethylene was also explored. According to 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, a mixture of propylene, 1-butene, and 2-butenes is formed. DFT calculations provide detailed mechanistic insights and support the occurrence of migratory insertion of ethylene, \xce\xb2-hydride elimination, and olefin exchange at gold(III)."
"A number of cyclic olefins were prepared and evaluated for the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction using novel N,P-ligated iridium imidazole-based catalysts (Crabtree type). The diversity of these cyclic olefins spanned those having little functionality to others bearing strongly coordinating substituents and heterocycles. Excellent enantioselectivities were observed both for substrates having little functionality (up to >99% ee) and for substrates possessing functional groups several carbons away from the olefin. Substrates having functionalities such as carboxyl groups, alcohols, or heterocycles in the vicinity of the C\xe2\x95\x90C bond were hydrogenated in high enantiomeric excess (up to >99% ee). The hydrogenation was also found to be regioselective, and by controlling the reaction conditions, selective hydrogenation of one of two trisubstituted olefins can be achieved. Furthermore, trisubstituted olefins can be selectively hydrogenated in the presence of tetrasubstituted olefins."
"The water dimer cation, (H2O)2+, has long served as a prototypical reference system for water oxidation chemistry. In spite of this status, a definitive explanation for the anomalous\xe2\x80\x94and dominant\xe2\x80\x94features in the experimental vibrational spectrum [Gardenier, G. H.; Johnson, M. A.; McCoy, A. B. J. Phys. Chem. A, 2009, 113, 4772\xe2\x80\x934779] has not been determined, and harmonic analyses qualitatively fail to reproduce these features. In this computational study, accurate quantum chemistry methods are combined with a fully coupled, six-dimensional anharmonic model to show that the unassigned bands are the result of resonant mode interactions and strong anharmonic coupling. Such coupling is fundamentally due to the unique electronic structure of this open-shell ion and the manner in which auxiliary modes affect the natural charge-transfer properties of the shared-proton stretch. These unique vibrational signatures provide a key reference point for modern spectroscopic and mechanistic analyses of water-oxidation catalysts."
"Enzymes are powerful catalysts, and a thorough understanding of the sources of their catalytic power will facilitate many medical and industrial applications. Here we have studied the catalytic mechanism of alkaline phosphatase (AP), which is one of the most catalytically proficient enzymes known. We have used quantum mechanics calculations and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations to model a variety of isotope effects relevant to the reaction of AP. We have calculated equilibrium isotope effects (EIEs), binding isotope effects (BIEs), and kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) for a range of phosphate mono- and diester substrates. The results agree well with experimental values, but the model for the reaction\xe2\x80\x99s transition state (TS) differs from the original interpretation of those experiments. Our model indicates that isotope effects on binding make important contributions to measured KIEs on V/K, which complicated interpretation of the measured values. Our results provide a detailed interpretation of the measured isotope effects and make predictions that can test the proposed model. The model indicates that the substrate is deformed in the ground state (GS) of the reaction and partially resembles the TS. The highly preorganized active site preferentially binds conformations that resemble the TS and not the GS, which induces the substrate to adapt to the enzyme, rather than the other way around\xe2\x80\x94as with classic \xe2\x80\x9cinduced fit\xe2\x80\x9d models. The preferential stabilization of the TS over the GS is what lowers the barrier to the chemical step."
"While solid-state NMR spectroscopic techniques have helped clarify the local structure and dynamics of ionic conductors, similar studies of mixed ionic\xe2\x80\x93electronic conductors (MIECs) have been hampered by the paramagnetic behavior of these systems. Here we report high-resolution 17O (I = 5/2) solid-state NMR spectra of the mixed-conducting solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode material La2NiO4+\xce\xb4, a paramagnetic transition-metal oxide. Three distinct oxygen environments (equatorial, axial, and interstitial) can be assigned on the basis of hyperfine (Fermi contact) shifts and quadrupolar nutation behavior, aided by results from periodic DFT calculations. Distinct structural distortions among the axial sites, arising from the nonstoichiometric incorporation of interstitial oxygen, can be resolved by advanced magic angle turning and phase-adjusted sideband separation (MATPASS) NMR experiments. Finally, variable-temperature spectra reveal the onset of rapid interstitial oxide motion and exchange with axial sites at \xe2\x88\xbc130 \xc2\xb0C, associated with the reported orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition of La2NiO4+\xce\xb4. From the variable-temperature spectra, we develop a model of oxide-ion dynamics on the spectral time scale that accounts for motional differences of all distinct oxygen sites. Though we treat La2NiO4+\xce\xb4 as a model system for a combined paramagnetic 17O NMR and DFT methodology, the approach presented herein should prove applicable to MIECs and other functionally important paramagnetic oxides."
"Significant progress has been observed in recent years in the synthesis of allylic amines, which are important building blocks in synthetic chemistry. Most of these processes are effective toward the preparation of allylic amines, with limited potential to introduce three or four different substituents on the olefinic unit in a stereocontrolled fashion. Therefore, the discovery of a mild and operationally simple protocol allowing such challenging stereoselective synthesis of multisubstituted allylic amines remains an inspiring target. Herein, we report the first general and practical methodology for the stereoselective synthesis of tri- and tetrasubstituted allylic amines based on Pd-catalyzed conversion of allyl surrogates readily obtained from cyclic vinyl carbonates. These rare conversions are characterized by excellent stereoselectivity, operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions, and wide scope in reaction partners. DFT studies were performed to rationalize the stereocontrol in these allylic amine formation reactions, and evidence is provided that the formation of a six-membered palladacyclic intermediate leads toward the formation of (Z)-configured allylic amine products."
"Preorganization and predisposition are important molecular recognition concepts exploited by nature to obtain site-specific and selective metal binding to proteins. While native structures containing an MS3 core are often unavailable in both apo- and holo-forms, one can use designed three-stranded coiled coils (3SCCs) containing tris-thiolate sites to evaluate these concepts. We show that the preferred metal geometry dictates the degree to which the cysteine rotamers change upon metal complexation. The Cys ligands in the apo-form are preorganized for binding trigonal pyramidal species (Pb(II)S3 and As(III)S3) in an endo conformation oriented toward the 3SCC C-termini, whereas the cysteines are predisposed for trigonal planar Hg(II)S3 and 4-coordinate Zn(II)S3O structures, requiring significant thiol rotation for metal binding. This study allows assessment of the importance of protein fold and side-chain reorientation for achieving metal selectivity in human retrotransposons and metalloregulatory proteins."
"We have developed a stereospecific, nickel-catalyzed Miyaura borylation of allylic pivalates, which delivers highly enantioenriched \xce\xb1-stereogenic \xce\xb3-aryl allylboronates with good yields and regioselectivities. Our complementary sets of conditions enable access to either enantiomer of allylboronate product from a single enantiomer of readily prepared allylic pivalate substrate. Excellent functional group tolerance, yields, regioselectivities, and stereochemical fidelities are observed. The stereochemical switch from stereoretention to stereoinversion largely depends upon solvent and can be explained by competitive pathways for the oxidative addition step. Our mechanistic investigations support a stereoretentive pathway stemming from a directed oxidative addition and a stereoinvertive pathway that is dominant when MeCN blocks coordination of the directing group by binding the nickel catalyst."
"Because of its importance for the origin of life, the nonenzymatic copying of RNA templates has been the subject of intense study for several decades. Previous characterizations of template-directed primer extension using 5\xe2\x80\xb2-phosphoryl-2-methylimidazole-activated nucleotides (2-MeImpNs) as substrates have assumed a classical in-line nucleophilic substitution mechanism, in which the 3\xe2\x80\xb2-hydroxyl of the primer attacks the phosphate of the incoming monomer, displacing the 2-methylimidazole leaving group. However, we have found that the initial rate of primer extension depends on the pH and concentration at which the activated monomer is maintained prior to the primer extension reaction. These and other results suggest an alternative mechanism, in which two monomers react with each other to form an imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide intermediate, which then binds to the template. Subsequent attack of the 3\xe2\x80\xb2-hydroxyl of the primer displaces an activated nucleotide as the leaving group and results in extension of the primer by one nucleotide. Analysis of monomer solutions by NMR indicates formation of the proposed imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide in the expected pH-dependent manner. We have used synthetic methods to prepare material that is enriched in this proposed intermediate and show that it is a highly reactive substrate for primer extension. The formation of an imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide intermediate provides a mechanistic interpretation of previously observed catalysis by an activated nucleotide located downstream from the site of primer extension."
Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to identify superoxide\xe2\x80\x99s origin in a water lipid/membrane system.
"A pure organic single crystal, [H2dabco]\xc2\xb7[2CB]2 ([H2dabco]2+ = diprotonated 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 2CB\xe2\x80\x93 = 2-chlorobenzoate), which undergoes a ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition above room temperature (\xe2\x88\xbc323 K upon heating), was prepared and characterized. This ferroelectric crystal possesses a distinctive supramolecular architecture composed of discrete H-bonded trimeric units (two 2CB\xe2\x80\x93 anions bridged by one [H2dabco]2+ cation through N\xe2\x80\x93H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O hydrogen bond interactions). In the paraelectric phase, the [H2dabco]2+ cation is rotationally disordered and lies at the symmetric center of the trimer. Upon cooling, it is frozen in an ordered state and deviates toward a 2CB\xe2\x80\x93 anion at one end along the H-bond. The collective displacement of the cations leads to a polarization of the single crystal along the crystallographic c axis, which is confirmed by the temperature dependence of the second harmonic generation and spontaneous polarization. A significant increase in the phase transition temperature of the deuterated analogue suggests that the proton plays an important role in the ferroelectric phase transition."
"Nitroreductase (NTR) activities have been known for decades, studied extensively in bacteria and also in systems as diverse as yeast, trypanosomes, and hypoxic tumors. The putative bacterial origin of mitochondria prompted us to explore the possible existence of NTR activity within this organelle and to probe its behavior in a cellular context. Presently, by using a profluorescent near-infrared (NIR) dye, we characterize the nature of NTR activity localized in mammalian cell mitochondria. Further, we demonstrate that this mitochondrially localized enzymatic activity can be exploited both for selective NIR imaging of mitochondria and for mitochondrial targeting by activating a mitochondrial poison specifically within that organelle. This constitutes a new mechanism for mitochondrial imaging and targeting. These findings represent the first use of mitochondrial enzyme activity to unmask agents for mitochondrial fluorescent imaging and therapy, which may prove to be more broadly applicable."
"We present a diastereodivergent strategy for constructing bicyclic \xce\xb3-lactones bearing quaternary carbon centers via ketone hydroacylation. By applying a Rh catalyst and JoSPOphos ligand, either the anti or syn bicyclic \xce\xb3-lactones can be accessed with high enantio- and diastereoselectivities, depending on the choice of solvent, temperature, and counterion."
"Reproducible synthesis of the elusive merlinoite (mer) topology of zinc imidazolate (mer-Zn(Im)2, or ZIF-10) has been achieved by employing a simple macrocyclic solute\xe2\x80\x94MeMeCH2\xe2\x80\x94as a kinetic template. The corresponding phase-pure material, mer-MeMeCH2@Zn16(Im)32, is confirmed to be porous and exhibits one of the highest experimental surface areas (1893 m2/g, BET) yet reported for any ZIF. The X-ray single crystal structure of mer-MeMeCH2@Zn16(Im)32\xc2\xb7xsolvent reveals the role of the macrocyle as an 8-fold hydrogen bond acceptor in templating the requisite double-eight rings (d8r) of the mer framework."
"Protein crystallography and calorimetry were used to characterize the binding of 1,2-azaborines to model cavities in T4 lysozyme in direct comparison to their carbonaceous counterparts. In the apolar L99A cavity, affinity for Ab dropped only slightly versus benzene. In the cavity designed to accommodate a single hydrogen bond (L99A/M102Q), Gln102\xe2\x95\x90O\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7H\xe2\x80\x94N hydrogen bonding for Ab and BEtAb was observed in the crystallographic complexes. The strength of the hydrogen bonding was estimated as 0.94 and 0.64 kcal/mol for Ab and BEtAb, respectively. This work unambiguously demonstrates that 1,2-azaborines can be readily accommodated in classic aryl recognition pockets and establishes one of 1,2-azaborine\xe2\x80\x99s distinguishing features from its carbonaceous isostere benzene: its ability to serve as an NH hydrogen bond donor in a biological setting."
"The small-pore Cu-CHA zeolite is today the object of intensive research efforts to rationalize its outstanding performance in the NH3-assisted selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of harmful nitrogen oxides and to unveil the SCR mechanism. Herein we exploit operando X-ray spectroscopies to monitor the Cu-CHA catalyst in action during NH3-SCR in the 150\xe2\x80\x93400 \xc2\xb0C range, targeting Cu oxidation state, mobility, and preferential N or O ligation as a function of reaction temperature. By combining operando XANES, EXAFS, and vtc-XES, we unambiguously identify two distinct regimes for the atomic-scale behavior of Cu active-sites. Low-temperature SCR, up to \xe2\x88\xbc200 \xc2\xb0C, is characterized by balanced populations of Cu(I)/Cu(II) sites and dominated by mobile NH3-solvated Cu-species. From 250 \xc2\xb0C upward, in correspondence to the steep increase in catalytic activity, the largely dominant Cu-species are framework-coordinated Cu(II) sites, likely representing the active sites for high-temperature SCR."
"Maturation of HIV-1 requires disassembly of the Gag polyprotein lattice, which lines the viral membrane in the immature state, and subsequent assembly of the mature capsid protein lattice, which encloses viral RNA in the mature state. Metastability of the immature lattice has been proposed to depend on the existence of a structurally ordered, \xce\xb1-helical segment spanning the junction between capsid (CA) and spacer peptide 1 (SP1) subunits of Gag, a segment that is dynamically disordered in the mature capsid lattice. We report solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) measurements on the immature lattice in noncrystalline, spherical virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from Gag. The ssNMR data provide definitive evidence for this critical \xce\xb1-helical segment in the VLPs. Differences in ssNMR chemical shifts and signal intensities between immature and mature lattice assemblies also support a major rearrangement of intermolecular interactions in the maturation process, consistent with recent models from electron cryomicroscopy and X-ray crystallography."
"Here we report that the rod-like tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), having a negatively charged surface, can be assembled into three-dimensional micrometer-sized bundle-like superstructures via multiple electrostatic interactions with a positively charged molecular \xe2\x80\x9cglue\xe2\x80\x9d, namely, a tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-based discrete organoplatinum(II) metallacycle (TPE-Pt-MC). Due to the nanoconfinement effect in the resultant TMV/TPE-Pt-MC complexes and the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) activity of the TPE units, these hierarchical architectures result in a dramatic fluorescence enhancement that not only provides evidence for the formation of novel metal\xe2\x80\x93organic biohybrid materials but also represents an alternative to turn-on fluorescence. Moreover, the dissociation of these final constructs and subsequent release of individual virus have been achieved by disrupting the TPE-Pt-MC core using tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB). This strategy is also compatible with other protein-based nanoparticles such as bacteriophage M13 and ferritin, proving the generality of this approach. Hence, this research will open new routes for the fabrication of functional biohybrid materials involving metal\xe2\x80\x93organic complexes and anisotropically shaped bionanoparticles."
"Oxygenation of alkenes is one of the most straightforward routes for the construction of carbonyl compounds. Wacker oxidation provides a broadly useful strategy to convert the mineral oil into higher value-added carbonyl chemicals. However, the conventional Wacker chemistry remains problematic, such as the poor activity for internal alkenes, the lack of anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity, and the high cost and chemical waste resulted from noble metal catalysts and stoichiometric oxidant. Here, we describe an unprecedented dehydrogenative oxygenation of \xce\xb2-alkyl styrenes and their derivatives with water under external-oxidant-free conditions by utilizing the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and proton-reduction catalysis that can address these challenges. This dual catalytic system possesses the single anti-Markovnikov selectivity due to the property of the visible-light-induced alkene radical cation intermediate."
"Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a biodegradable polymer prepared by the catalyzed ring opening polymerization of lactide. An ideal catalyst should enable a sequential polymerization of the lactide enantiomers to afford stereoblock copolymers with predetermined number and lengths of blocks. We describe a magnesium based catalyst that combines very high activity with a true-living nature, which gives access to PLA materials of unprecedented microstructures. Full consumption of thousands of equivalents of L-LA within minutes gave PLLA of expected molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions. Precise PLLA-b-PDLA diblock copolymers having block lengths of up to 500 repeat units were readily prepared within 30 min, and their thermal characterization revealed a stereocomplex phase only with very high melting transitions and melting enthalpies. The one pot sequential polymerization was extended up to precise hexablocks having \xe2\x80\x9cdialed-in\xe2\x80\x9d block lengths."
"Crystalline 3-D materials bearing interlinked domains of differential porosity and functionality offer the potential for organizing and shuttling molecular and nanoscale matter to specific locations within 3-D space. Here, we present methods for creating prototype MOF materials that have such structural features. Specifically, the process of pore expansion via ligand exchange was studied for an isoreticular series of mesoporous MOFs based on bMOF-100. It was found that pore expansion occurs incrementally in small steps and that it proceeds gradually in an \xe2\x80\x9coutside\xe2\x86\x92in\xe2\x80\x9d fashion within individual crystals. The ligand exchange reaction can be terminated prior to complete crystal conversion to yield intermediate product MOFs, denoted bMOF-100/102 and bMOF-102/106, which bear descending porosity gradients from the crystal periphery to the crystal core. As a proof of concept, size-sensitive incorporation of a gold\xe2\x80\x93thiolate nanocluster, Au133(SR)52, selectively in the bMOF-102/106 crystal periphery region was accomplished via cation exchange. These new methods open up the possibility of controlling molecular organization and transport within porous MOF materials."
"We demonstrate that configurationally stable anomeric stannanes undergo a stereospecific cross-coupling reaction with aromatic halides in the presence of a palladium catalyst with exceptionally high levels of stereocontrol. In addition to a broad substrate scope (>40 examples), this reaction eliminates critical problems inherent to nucleophilic displacement methods and is applicable to (hetero)aromatics, peptides, pharmaceuticals, common monosaccharides, and saccharides containing free hydroxyl groups."
"The Pd0-catalyzed coupling of racemic heterobiaryl bromides, triflates, or nonaflates with aryl/alkyl primary amines using QUINAP as the ligand provides the corresponding axially chiral heterobiaryl amines with excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Reactivity and structural studies of neutral and cationic oxidative addition intermediates support a dynamic kinetic asymmetric amination mechanism based on the labilization of the stereogenic axis in the latter and suggest that coordination of the amine to the Pd center is the stereodetermining step."
"Asymmetric preparation of all-carbon quaternary stereocenters is an important goal. Despite advances in formation of highly enantioenriched products with quaternary stereocenters proximal to a functional group, methods to install quaternary stereocenters isolated from functional groups are limited. Transition metal catalysis offers a potential solution, but prior cross couplings are limited to allylic substrates or deliver little to no enantiomeric enrichment. We report a stereospecific, nickel-catalyzed Suzuki\xe2\x80\x93Miyaura arylation of tertiary benzylic acetates to deliver products with diaryl and triaryl quaternary stereocenters in high yields and ee\xe2\x80\x99s. This reaction employs an inexpensive, air-stable Ni(II) salt and commercially available phosphine ligand to transform tertiary alcohol derivatives, which are easily available in exceptional ee, into valuable products with stereoretention."
"A novel strategy for the synthesis of functionalized carbocycles is defined, through the cascade carbocyclization of alkenylboronic acids with \xce\xb4- or \xce\xb3-cyano-N-tosylhydrazones. In the reaction, two C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93C(sp2) bonds are formed on the former hydrazonic carbon generating an all-carbon quaternary stereocenter, and leading to cyclic ketones featuring an alkenyl side chain with complete diastereoselectivity. The processes are conducted under very simple experimental conditions, only in the presence of K2CO3, in 1,4-dioxane as solvent and under microwave irradiation, and have been applied for the synthesis of a wide structural variety of fused cyclopentanones and cyclohexanones. Moreover, the versatility of this methodology has been demonstrated in the structural modification of androsterone."
"Ion-exchange transformations allow access to nanocrystalline materials with compositions that are inaccessible via direct synthetic routes. However, additional mechanistic insight into the processes that govern these reactions is needed. We present evidence for the presence of two distinct mechanisms of exchange during anion exchange in CsPbX3 nanocrystals (NCs), ranging in size from 6.5 to 11.5 nm, for transformations from CsPbBr3 to CsPbCl3 or CsPbI3. These NCs exhibit bright luminescence throughout the exchange, allowing their optical properties to be observed in real time, in situ. The iodine exchange presents surface-reaction-limited exchanges allowing all anionic sites within the NC to appear chemically identical, whereas the chlorine exchange presents diffusion-limited exchanges proceeding through a more complicated exchange mechanism. Our results represent the first steps toward developing a microkinetic description of the anion exchange, with implications not only for understanding the lead halide perovskites but also for nanoscale ion exchange in general."
"Benzylic alcohols and ethers are common subunits in bioactive molecules, as well as useful intermediates in organic chemistry. In this Communication, we describe a new approach to the enantioselective synthesis of benzylic ethers through the chiral phosphine-catalyzed coupling of two readily available partners, \xce\xb3-aryl-substituted alkynoates and alcohols, under mild conditions. In this process, the alkynoate partner undergoes an internal redox reaction. Specifically, the benzylic position is oxidized with good enantioselectivity, and the alkyne is reduced to the alkene."
"Despite the importance of allylic ylide rearrangements for the synthesis of complex molecules, the catalyst control of [2,3]- and [1,2]-rearrangements remains an unsolved problem. We developed the first regiodivergent [2,3]- and [1,2]-rearrangements of iodonium ylides that are controlled by copper catalysts bearing different ligands. In the presence of a 2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-dipyridyl ligand, diazoesters and allylic iodides react via a [2,3]-rearrangement pathway. Alternatively, a phosphine ligand favors the formation of the [1,2]-rearrangement product. A series of \xce\xb1-iodoesters containing a broad range of functional groups were obtained in high yields, regioselectivities, and diastereoselectivities. Deuterium-labeling studies suggest distinct mechanisms for the regioselective rearrangements."
"Small diffusible redox proteins facilitate electron transfer in respiration and photosynthesis by alternately binding to their redox partners and integral membrane proteins and exchanging electrons. Diffusive search, recognition, binding, and unbinding of these proteins often amount to kinetic bottlenecks in cellular energy conversion, but despite the availability of structures and intense study, the physical mechanisms controlling redox partner interactions remain largely unknown. The present molecular dynamics study provides an all-atom description of the cytochrome c2-docked bc1 complex in Rhodobacter sphaeroides in terms of an ensemble of favorable docking conformations and reveals an intricate series of conformational changes that allow cytochrome c2 to recognize the bc1 complex and bind or unbind in a redox state-dependent manner. In particular, the role of electron transfer in triggering a molecular switch and in altering water-mediated interface mobility, thereby strengthening and weakening complex formation, is described. The results resolve long-standing discrepancies between structural and functional data."
"Preventing and treating Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease require understanding the aggregation of amyloid beta 1\xe2\x80\x9342 (A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9342) to give oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils. Here we describe footprinting of A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9342 by hydroxyl radical-based fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) and mass spectrometry (MS) to monitor the time-course of A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9342 aggregation. We resolved five distinct stages characterized by two sigmoidal behaviors, showing the time-dependent transitions of monomers-paranuclei-protofibrils-fibrillar aggregates. Kinetic modeling allows deciphering the amounts and interconversion of the dominant A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9342 species. Moreover, the irreversible footprinting probe provides insights into the kinetics of oligomerization and subsequent fibrillar growth by allowing the conformational changes of A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9342 at subregional and even amino-acid-residue levels to be revealed. The middle domain of A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9342 plays a major role in aggregation, whereas the N-terminus retains most of its solvent-accessibility during aggregation, and the hydrophobic C-terminus is involved to an intermediate extent. This approach affords an in situ, real-time monitoring of the solvent accessibility of A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9342 at various stages of oligomerization, and provides new insights on site-specific aggregation of A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9342 for a sample state beyond the capabilities of most other biophysical methods."
"A \xe2\x80\x9cD-scan\xe2\x80\x9d of two small proteins, the disulfide-rich Ecballium elaterium trypsin inhibitor II (EETI-II) and a minimized Z domain of protein A (Z33), is reported. For each protein, the stereochemistry of one amino acid at a time was inverted to generate a series of diastereomers. In much the same way an alanine scan determines necessary residues for protein function, the D-scan elucidated the critical stereocenters of the 30-residue EETI-II and the 33-residue Z33. The folding properties and activity of each variant were investigated. A total of 24 out of 30 EETI-II D-scan analogues folded to give a three-disulfide product. Of the 24 variants that folded, half were high-affinity trypsin inhibitors, and three were as active as the wild type (WT). Of these 12 active variants, most were substantially less stable to reduction than WT EETI-II (WT first reduction potential \xe2\x88\x92270.0 \xc2\xb1 1.5 mV, WT second reduction potential \xe2\x88\x92307.2 \xc2\xb1 1.1 mV). Similarly, ten Z33 analogues retained high binding affinity to IgG (KD < 250 nM, WT: 24 \xc2\xb1 1 nM) and 12 additional analogues had reduced but appreciable IgG binding affinity (KD between 250 nM and 2.5 \xce\xbcM). As with EETI-II, most Z33 analogues were substantially less stable than the WT (\xce\x94G(H2O, 263 K) = 2.4 \xc2\xb1 1.2 kcal/mol). Collectively, our findings show that the D-scan is powerful new strategy for studying how the stereochemistry of amino acids affects the structure and function of proteins."
"The use of hydride species for substrate reductions avoids strong reductants, and may enable nitrogenase to reduce multiple bonds without unreasonably low redox potentials. In this work, we explore the N\xe2\x95\x90N bond cleaving ability of a high-spin iron(II) hydride dimer with concomitant release of H2. Specifically, this diiron(II) complex reacts with azobenzene (PhN\xe2\x95\x90NPh) to perform a four-electron reduction, where two electrons come from H2 reductive elimination and the other two come from iron oxidation. The rate law of the H2 releasing reaction indicates that diazene binding occurs prior to H2 elimination, and the negative entropy of activation and inverse kinetic isotope effect indicate that H\xe2\x80\x93H bond formation is the rate-limiting step. Thus, substrate binding causes reductive elimination of H2 that formally reduces the metals, and the metals use the additional two electrons to cleave the N\xe2\x80\x93N multiple bond."
"The enzyme cytochrome P450 11A1 cleaves the C20\xe2\x80\x93C22 carbon\xe2\x80\x93carbon bond of cholesterol to form pregnenolone, the first 21-carbon precursor of all steroid hormones. Various reaction mechanisms are possible for the carbon\xe2\x80\x93carbon bond cleavage step of P450 11A1, and most current proposals involve the oxoferryl active species, Compound I (FeO3+). Compound I can either (i) abstract an O\xe2\x80\x93H hydrogen atom or (ii) be attacked by a nucleophilic hydroxy group of its substrate, 20R,22R-dihydroxycholesterol. The mechanism of this carbon\xe2\x80\x93carbon bond cleavage step was tested using 18O-labeled molecular oxygen and purified P450 11A1. P450 11A1 was incubated with 20R,22R-dihydroxycholesterol in the presence of molecular oxygen (18O2), and coupled assays were used to trap the labile 18O atoms in the enzymatic products (i.e., isocaproaldehyde and pregnenolone). The resulting products were derivatized and the 18O content was analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. P450 11A1 showed no incorporation of an 18O atom into either of its carbon\xe2\x80\x93carbon bond cleavage products, pregnenolone and isocaproaldehyde . The positive control experiments established retention of the carbonyl oxygens in the enzymatic products during the trapping and derivatization processes. These results reveal a mechanism involving an electrophilic Compound I species that reacts with nucleophilic hydroxy groups in the 20R,22R-dihydroxycholesterol intermediate of the P450 11A1 reaction to produce the key steroid pregnenolone."
"Bowl-shaped \xcf\x80-conjugated compounds, or buckybowls, are a novel class of sp2-hybridized nanocarbon materials. In contrast to tubular carbon nanotubes and ball-shaped fullerenes, the buckybowls feature structural flexibility. Bowl-to-bowl structural inversion is one of the unique properties of the buckybowls in solutions. Bowl inversion on a surface modifies the metal\xe2\x80\x93molecule interactions through bistable switching between bowl-up and bowl-down states on the surface, which makes surface-adsorbed buckybowls a relevant model system for elucidation of the mechano-electronic properties of nanocarbon materials. Here, we report a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements and ab initio atomistic simulations to identify the adlayer structure of the sumanene buckybowl on Au(111) and reveal its unique bowl inversion behavior. We demonstrate that the bowl inversion can be induced by approaching the STM tip toward the molecule. By tuning the local metal\xe2\x80\x93molecule interaction using the STM tip, the sumanene buckybowl exhibits structural bistability with a switching rate that is two orders of magnitude faster than that of the stochastic inversion process."
"A key part of the respiratory and photosynthetic pathways is the bc1 protein complex embedded in the inner membrane of mitochondria and the plasma membrane of photosynthetic bacteria. The protein complex pumps protons across the membrane to maintain an electrostatic potential, which is in turn used to drive ATP synthesis. This molecular machinery, however, is suspected to be a source of superoxide, which is toxic to the cell, even in minuscular quantities, and believed to be a factor in aging. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate here the migration of molecular oxygen in the bc1 complex in order to identify possible reaction sites that could lead to superoxide formation. It is found, in particular, that oxygen penetrates spontaneously the Qo binding site of the bc1 complex in the presence of an intermediate semiquinone radical, thus making the Qo-site a strong candidate for being a center of superoxide production."
"In demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, disrupted myelin structures impair the functional role of the sheath as an insulating layer for proper nerve conduction. Though the etiology and recovery pathways remain unclear, in vivo studies show alterations in the lipid and the adhesive protein (myelin basic protein, MBP) composition. We find that in vitro cytoplasmic myelin membranes with modified lipid composition and low MBP concentration, as in demyelinating disease, show structural instabilities and pathological phase transition from a lamellar to inverted hexagonal, which involve enhanced local curvature. Similar curvatures are also found in vivo in diseased myelin sheaths. In addition, MBP dimers form a correlated mesh-like network within the inner membrane space, only in the vicinity of native lipid composition. These findings delineate the distinct functional roles of dominant constituents in cytoplasmic myelin sheaths, and shed new light on mechanisms disrupting lipid\xe2\x80\x93protein complexes in the diseased state."
"The ability for tuning not only the composition but also the type of surface facets of alloyed nanomaterials is important for the design of catalysts with enhanced activity and stability through optimizing both ensemble and ligand effects. Herein we report the first example of ultrathin platinum\xe2\x80\x93gold alloy nanowires (PtAu NWs) featuring composition-tunable and (111) facet-dominant surface characteristics, and the electrocatalytic enhancement for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). PtAu NWs of different bimetallic compositions synthesized by a single-phase and surfactant-free method are shown to display an alloyed, parallel-bundled structure in which the individual nanowires exhibit Boerdijk\xe2\x80\x93Coxeter helix type morphology predominant in (111) facets. Results have revealed intriguing catalytic correlation with the binary composition, exhibiting an activity maximum at a Pt:Au ratio of \xe2\x88\xbc3:1. As revealed by high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction and atomic pair distribution function analysis, NWs of this ratio exhibit a clear shrinkage in interatomic bonding distances. In comparison with PtAu nanoparticles of a similar composition and degree of shrinking of atomic-pair distances, the PtAu NWs display a remarkably higher electrocatalytic activity and stability. The outperformance of NWs over nanoparticles is attributed to the predominant (111)-type facets on the surface balancing the contribution of ensemble and ligand effects, in addition to the composition synergy due to optimal adsorption energies for molecular and atomic oxygen species on the surface as supported by DFT computation of models of the catalysts. The findings open up a new pathway to the design and engineering of alloy nanocatalysts with enhanced activity and durability."
"Antigen uptake and processing by innate immune cells is crucial to initiate the immune response. Therein, the endocytic C-type lectin receptors serve as pattern recognition receptors, detecting pathogens by their glycan structures. Herein, we studied the carbohydrate recognition domain of Langerin, a C-type lectin receptor involved in the host defense against viruses such as HIV and influenza as well as bacteria and fungi. Using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics simulations, we unraveled the molecular determinants underlying cargo capture and release encoded in the receptor architecture. Our findings revealed receptor dynamics over several time scales associated with binding and release of the essential cofactor Ca2+ controlled by the coupled motions of two loops. Applying mutual information theory and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified an allosteric intradomain network that modulates the Ca2+ affinity depending on the pH, thereby promoting fast ligand release."
"An unprecedented 2:2 complex was shown to intervene in the enantiodifferentiating photocyclodimerization of 2-anthracenecarboxylic acid (A) mediated by a hydrogen-bonding template l-prolinol (P) to accelerate the formation of chiral anti-head-to-head and achiral syn-head-to-head cyclodimers in >99% combined yield with enhanced enantioselectivities of up to 72% ee for the former. The supramolecular complexation and photochirogenic behaviors, as well as the plausible structures, of intervening Am\xc2\xb7Pn complexes (m, n = 1 or 2) were elucidated by combined theoretical and experimental spectroscopic, photophysical, and photochemical studies. Furthermore, the photochemical chiral amplification was achieved for the first time by utilizing the preferential 2:2 complexation of A with homochiral P to give normalized product enantioselectivities higher than those of the template used. The present strategy based on the higher-order hydrogen-bonding motif, which is potentially applicable to a variety of carboxylic acids and \xce\xb2-aminoalcohols, is not only conceptually new and expandable to other (photo)chirogenic and sensing systems but also may serve as a versatile tool for achieving photochemical asymmetric amplification and constructing chiral functional supramolecular architectures."
"A de novo topology of virus-like assembly is reported. The design is a trifaceted coiled-coil peptide helix, which self-assembles into ultrasmall, monodisperse, anionic virus-like shells that encapsulate and transfer both RNA and DNA into human cells. Unlike existing artificial systems, these shells share the same physical characteristics of viruses being anionic, nonaggregating, abundant, hollow, and uniform in size, while effectively mediating gene silencing and transgene expression. These are the smallest virus-like structures reported to date, both synthetic and native, with the ability to adapt and transfer small and large nucleic acids. The design thus offers a promising solution for engineering bespoke artificial viruses with desired functions."
"Accounting for the interactions of light with heterogeneous, anisotropic, absorbing, optically active media is part of the characterization of complex, transparent materials. Stained biological structures in thin tissue sections share many of these features, but systematic optical analyses beyond the employ of the simple petrographic microscopes have not be established. Here, this accounting is made for polycrystalline, spherulitic bundles of twisted d-mannitol lamellae grown from melts containing light-absorbing molecules. It has long been known that a significant percentage of molecular crystals readily grow as helicoidal ribbons with mesoscale pitches, but a general appreciation of the commonality of these non-classical crystal forms has been lost. Helicoidal crystal twisting was typically assayed by analyzing refractivity modulation in the petrographic microscope. However, by growing twisted crystals from melts in the presence of dissolved, light-absorbing molecules, crystal twisting can be assayed by analyzing the dichroism, both linear and circular. The term \xe2\x80\x9chelicoidal dichroism\xe2\x80\x9d is used here to describe the optical consequences of anisotropic absorbers precessing around radii of twisted crystalline fibrils or lamellae. d-Mannitol twists in two polymorphic forms, \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb4. The two polymorphs, when grown from supercooled melts in the presence of a variety of histochemical stains and textile dyes, are strongly dichroic in linearly polarized white light. The bis-azo dye Chicago sky blue is modeled because it is most absorbing when parallel and perpendicular to the radial axes in the respective spherulitic polymorphs. Optical properties were measured using Mueller matrix imaging polarimetry and simulated by taking into account the microstructure of the lamellae. The optical analysis of the dyed, patterned polycrystals clarifies aspects of the mesostructure that can be difficult to extract from bundles of tightly packed fibrils."
"Controlling the internal motions of molecules by outside stimuli is a decisive task for the generation of responsive and complex molecular behavior and functionality. Light-induced structural changes of photoswitches are of special high interest due to the ease of signal application and high repeatability. Typically photoswitches use one reaction coordinate in their switching process and change between two more or less-defined states. Here we report on new twisted hemithioindigo photoswitches enabling two different reaction coordinates to be used for the switching process. Depending on the polarity of the solvent, either complete single bond (in DMSO) or double bond (in cyclohexane) rotation can be induced by visible light. This mutually independent switching establishes an unprecedented two-dimensional control of intramolecular rotations in this class of photoswitches. The mechanistic explanation involves formation of highly polar twisted intramolecular charge-transfer species in the excited state and is based on a large body of experimental quantifications, most notably ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum yield measurements in solvents of different polarity. The concept of pre-twisting in the ground state to open new, independent reaction coordinates in the excited state should be transferable to other photoswitching systems."
"The stimuli-responsive nature of molecular gels makes them appealing platforms for sensing. The biggest challenge is in identifying an appropriate gelator for each specific chemical or biological target. Due to the similarities between crystallization and gel formation, we hypothesized that the tools used to predict crystal morphologies could be useful for identifying gelators. Herein, we demonstrate that new gelators can be discovered by focusing on scaffolds with predicted high aspect ratio crystals. Using this morphology prediction method, we identified two promising molecular scaffolds containing lead atoms. Because solvent is largely ignored in morphology prediction but can play a major role in gelation, each scaffold needed to be structurally modified before six new Pb-containing gelators were discovered. One of these new gelators was developed into a robust sensor capable of detecting lead at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency limit for paint (5000 ppm)."
"We report here the synthesis of robust and porous metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs), M-MTBC (M = Zr or Hf), constructed from the tetrahedral linker methane-tetrakis(p-biphenylcarboxylate) (MTBC) and two types of secondary building units (SBUs): cubic M8(\xce\xbc2-O)8(\xce\xbc2-OH)4 and octahedral M6(\xce\xbc3-O)4(\xce\xbc3-OH)4. While the M6-SBU is isostructural with the 12-connected octahedral SBUs of UiO-type MOFs, the M8-SBU is composed of eight MIV ions in a cubic fashion linked by eight \xce\xbc2-oxo and four \xce\xbc2-OH groups. The metalation of Zr-MTBC SBUs with CoCl2, followed by treatment with NaBEt3H, afforded highly active and reusable solid Zr-MTBC-CoH catalysts for the hydrogenation of alkenes, imines, carbonyls, and heterocycles. Zr-MTBC-CoH was impressively tolerant of a range of functional groups and displayed high activity in the hydrogenation of tri- and tetra-substituted alkenes with TON > 8000 for the hydrogenation of 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene. Our structural and spectroscopic studies show that site isolation of and open environments around the cobalt-hydride catalytic species at Zr8-SBUs are responsible for high catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of a wide range of challenging substrates. MOFs thus provide a novel platform for discovering and studying new single-site base-metal solid catalysts with enormous potential for sustainable chemical synthesis."
"Human calprotectin (CP, S100A8/S100A9 oligomer, MRP-8/MRP-14 oligomer) is an abundant host-defense protein that is involved in the metal-withholding innate immune response. CP coordinates a variety of divalent first-row transition metal ions, which is implicated in its antimicrobial function, and its ability to sequester nutrient Zn(II) ions from microbial pathogens has been recognized for over two decades. CP has two distinct transition-metal-binding sites formed at the S100A8/S100A9 dimer interface, including a histidine-rich site composed of S100A8 residues His17 and His27 and S100A9 residues His91 and His95. In this study, we report that CP binds Zn(II) at this site using a hexahistidine motif, completed by His103 and His105 of the S100A9 C-terminal tail and previously identified as the high-affinity Mn(II) and Fe(II) coordination site. Zn(II) binding at this unique site shields the S100A9 C-terminal tail from proteolytic degradation by proteinase K. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and Zn(II) competition titrations support the formation of a Zn(II)-His6 motif. Microbial growth studies indicate that the hexahistidine motif is important for preventing microbial Zn(II) acquisition from CP by the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum and the opportunistic human pathogen Candida albicans. The Zn(II)-His6 site of CP expands the known biological coordination chemistry of Zn(II) and provides new insight into how the human innate immune system starves microbes of essential metal nutrients."
"The Rh(III)-catalyzed oxidative C\xe2\x80\x93H allylation of N-acetylbenzamides with 1,3-dienes is described. The presence of allylic hydrogens cis to the less substituted alkene of the 1,3-diene is important for the success of these reactions. With the assistance of reactions using deuterated 1,3-dienes, a proposed mechanism is provided. The key step is postulated to be the first reported examples of allyl-to-allyl 1,4-Rh(III) migration."
"All-solid-state Li-batteries using solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer enhanced safety over conventional Li-ion batteries with organic liquid electrolytes due to the nonflammable nature of SSEs. The superior mechanical strength of SSEs can also protect against Li dendrite penetration, which enables the use of the highest specific capacity (3861 mAh/g) and lowest redox potential (\xe2\x88\x923.04 V vs standard hydrogen electrode) anode: Li metal. However, contact between the Li metal and SSEs presents a major challenge, where a large polarization occurs at the Li metal/SSE interface. Here, the chemical properties of a promising oxide-based SSE (garnet) changed from \xe2\x80\x9csuper-lithiophobicity\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9csuper-lithiophilicity\xe2\x80\x9d through an ultrathin coating of amorphous Si deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The wettability transition is due to the reaction between Li and Si and the in situ formation of lithiated Si. As a result, symmetric cells composed of a Si-coated garnet-structured SSE and Li metal electrodes exhibited much smaller impedance and excellent stability upon plating/stripping cycles compared to cells using bare garnet SSE. Specifically, the interfacial resistance between Li and garnet dramatically decreased from 925 to 127 \xce\xa9 cm2 when lithiated Si was formed on the garnet. Our discovery of switchable lithiophobic-lithiophilic surfaces to improve the Li metal/SSE interface opens opportunities for improving many other SSEs."
"We report a quantitative understanding of the reduction kinetics responsible for the formation of Pd\xe2\x80\x93Pt bimetallic nanocrystals with two distinctive structures. The syntheses involve the use of KBr to manipulate the reaction kinetics by influencing the redox potentials of metal precursor ions via ligand exchange. In the absence of KBr, the ratio between the initial reduction rates of PdCl42\xe2\x80\x93 and PtCl42\xe2\x80\x93 was about 10.0, leading to the formation of Pd@Pt octahedra with a core\xe2\x80\x93shell structure. In the presence of 63 mM KBr, the products became Pd\xe2\x80\x93Pt alloy nanocrystals. In this case, the ratio between the initial reduction rates of the two precursors dropped to 2.4 because of ligand exchange and, thus, the formation of PdBr42\xe2\x80\x93 and PtBr42\xe2\x80\x93. The alloy nanocrystals took a cubic shape owing to the selective capping effect of Br\xe2\x80\x93 ions toward the {100} facets. Relative to the alloy nanocubes, the Pd@Pt core\xe2\x80\x93shell octahedra showed substantial enhancement in both catalytic activity and durability toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, the specific (1.51 mA cm\xe2\x80\x932) and mass (1.05 A mg\xe2\x80\x931 Pt) activities of the core\xe2\x80\x93shell octahedra were enhanced by about four- and three-fold relative to the alloy nanocubes (0.39 mA cm\xe2\x80\x932 and 0.34 A mg\xe2\x80\x931 Pt, respectively). Even after 20000 cycles of accelerated durability test, the core\xe2\x80\x93shell octahedra still exhibited a mass activity of 0.68 A mg\xe2\x80\x931 Pt, twice that of a pristine commercial Pt/C catalyst."
"A novel I2-catalyzed direct conversion of cyclohexanones to substituted catechols under mild and simple conditions has been described. This novel transformation is remarkable with the multiple oxygenation and dehydrogenative aromatization processes enabled just by using DMSO as the solvent, oxidant, and oxygen source. This metal-free and simple system demonstrates a versatile protocol for the synthesis of highly valuable substituted catechols and therefore streamlines the synthesis and modification of biologically important molecules for drug discovery."
"Dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) is used to enhance the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), enabling monitoring of metabolism and specific enzymatic reactions in vivo. dDNP involves rapid sample dissolution and transfer to a spectrometer/scanner for subsequent signal detection. So far, most biologically oriented dDNP studies have relied on hyperpolarizing long-lived nuclear spin species such as 13C in small molecules. While advantages could also arise from observing hyperpolarized 1H, short relaxation times limit the utility of prepolarizing this sensitive but fast relaxing nucleus. Recently, it has been reported that 1H NMR peaks in solution-phase experiments could be hyperpolarized by spontaneous magnetization transfers from bound 13C nuclei following dDNP. This work demonstrates the potential of this sensitivity-enhancing approach to probe the enzymatic process that could not be suitably resolved by 13C dDNP MR. Here we measured, in microorganisms, the action of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and pyruvate formate lyase (PFL)\xe2\x80\x94enzymes that catalyze the decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetaldehyde and formate, respectively. While 13C NMR did not possess the resolution to distinguish the starting pyruvate precursor from the carbonyl resonances in the resulting products, these processes could be monitored by 1H NMR at 500 MHz. These observations were possible in both yeast and bacteria in minute-long kinetic measurements where the hyperpolarized 13C enhanced, via 13C \xe2\x86\x92 1H cross-relaxation, the signals of protons binding to the 13C over the course of enzymatic reactions. In addition to these spontaneous heteronuclear enhancement experiments, single-shot acquisitions based on J-driven 13C \xe2\x86\x92 1H polarization transfers were also carried out. These resulted in higher signal enhancements of the 1H resonances but were not suitable for multishot kinetic studies. The potential of these 1H-based approaches for measurements in vivo is briefly discussed."
"Two layers of molecular oligomers were deposited on flat carbon electrode surfaces by electrochemical reduction of diazonium reagents, then a top contact applied to complete a solid-state molecular junction containing a molecular bilayer. The structures and energy levels of the molecular layers included donor molecules with relatively high energy occupied orbitals and acceptors with low energy unoccupied orbitals. When the energy levels of the two molecular layers were similar, the device had electronic characteristics similar to a thick layer of a single molecule, but if the energy levels differed, the current voltage behavior exhibited pronounced rectification. Higher current was observed when the acceptor molecule was biased negatively in eight different bilayer combinations, and the direction of rectification was reversed if the molecular layers were also reversed. Rectification persisted at very low temperature (7 K), and was activationless between 7 and 100 K. The results are a clear example of a \xe2\x80\x9cmolecular signature\xe2\x80\x9d in which electronic behavior is directly affected by molecular structure and orbital energies. The rectification mechanism is discussed, and may provide a basis for rational design of electronic properties by variation of molecular structure."
"We have developed a new class of cinchonium betaine catalysts bearing both a base moiety and an aromatic moiety as an N-substituent of the quinuclidine motif. These cinchonium betaines were found to promote proton transfer catalysis with 1000\xe2\x80\x935000 turnovers per 24 h, thereby enabling us to realize highly efficient enantioselective isomerization of trifluoromethyl imines to provide a practical access to optically active trifluoromethylated amines."
Artificial glycopolypeptides undergo a more complex hierarchical self-assembly process than previously observed.
"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate numerous proteins and are important for many biological processes. Lysine 4-oxononanoylation (4-ONylation) is a newly discovered histone PTM that prevents nucleosome assembly under oxidative stress. Whether there are cellular enzymes that remove 4-ONyl from histones remains unknown, which hampers the further investigation of the cellular function of this PTM. Here, we report that mammalian SIRT2 can remove 4-ONyl from histones and other proteins in live cells. A crystal structure of SIRT2 in complex with a 4-ONyl peptide reveals a lone pair\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interaction between Phe119 and the ketone oxygen of the 4-ONyl group. This is the first time that a mechanism to reverse 4-ONyl lysine modification is reported and will help to understand the role of SIRT2 in oxidative stress responses and the function of 4-ONylation."
"Dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (DS-PECs) for water splitting hold promise for the large-scale storage of solar energy in the form of (solar) fuels, owing to the low cost and ease to process of their constitutive photoelectrode materials. The efficiency of such systems ultimately depends on our capacity to promote unidirectional light-driven electron transfer from the electrode substrate to a catalytic moiety. We report here on the first noble-metal free and covalent dye\xe2\x80\x93catalyst assembly able to achieve photoelectrochemical visible light-driven H2 evolution in mildly acidic aqueous conditions when grafted onto p-type NiO electrode substrate."
"For the first time, 4-alkyl Hantzsch esters were used to construct molecules with all-carbon quaternary centers by visible light-induced photoredox catalysis via transfer alkylation. Up to a 1500 h\xe2\x80\x931 turnover frequency was achieved in this reaction. Reactions of 4-alkyl Hantzsch nitriles as tertiary radical donors joined two contiguous all-carbon quaternary centers intermolecularly, and this chemistry was used to synthesize a common precursor of a class of hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitors."
"A catalytic formal ene reaction between ketone-derived silyl enol ethers and terminal alkynes is described. This transformation is uniquely capable of bimolecular assembly of 2-siloxy-1,4-dienes and can be used to access \xce\xb2,\xce\xb3-unsaturated ketones containing quaternary carbons in the \xce\xb1-position."
"Synthesis of CF3-containing compounds is of great interest because of their broad use in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Herein, selective 2,2,2-trifluoroethylation of styrenes was catalyzed by Zr(IV)-based MOFs bearing visible-light photocatalysts in the form of Ir(III) polypyridyl complexes. When compared to the homogeneous Ir(III) catalyst, the MOF-based catalyst suppressed the dimerization of benzyl radicals, thus enhancing the selectivity of the desired hydroxytrifluoroethyl compounds."
"Microbes sense and respond to their environment with small molecules, and discovering these molecules and identifying their functions informs chemistry, biology, and medicine. As part of a study of molecular exchanges between termite-associated actinobacteria and pathogenic fungi, we uncovered a remarkable fungal metabolite, homodimericin A, which is strongly upregulated by the bacterial metabolite bafilomycin C1. Homodimericin A is a hexacyclic polyketide with a carbon backbone containing eight contiguous stereogenic carbons in a C20 hexacyclic core. Only half of its carbon atoms have an attached hydrogen, which presented a significant challenge for NMR-based structural analysis. In spite of its microbial production and rich stereochemistry, homodimericin A occurs naturally as a racemic mixture. A plausible nonenzymatic reaction cascade leading from two identical achiral monomers to homodimericin A is presented, and homodimericin A\xe2\x80\x99s formation by this path, a six-electron oxidation, could be a response to oxidative stress triggered by bafilomycin C1."
"Transformation of naphthopyran into a colored merocyanine species in polymeric materials is achieved using mechanical force. We demonstrate that the mechanochemical reactivity of naphthopyran is critically dependent on the regiochemistry, with only one particular substitution pattern leading to successful mechanochemical activation. Two alternative regioisomers with different polymer attachment points are demonstrated to be mechanochemically inactive. This trend in reactivity is accurately predicted by DFT calculations, reinforcing predictive capabilities in mechanochemical systems. We rationalize the reactivity differences between naphthopyran regioisomers in terms of the alignment of the target C\xe2\x80\x93O pyran bond with the direction of the applied mechanical force and its effect on mechanochemical transduction along the reaction coordinate."
"There have been breakthroughs in the development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with tunability of composition, structure, and function, but the synthesis of chiral COFs remains a great challenge. Here we report the construction of two-dimensional COFs with chiral functionalities embedded into the frameworks by imine condensations of enantiopure TADDOL-derived tetraaldehydes with 4,4\xe2\x80\xb2-diaminodiphenylmethane. Powder X-ray diffraction and computer modeling together with pore size distribution analysis show that one COF has a twofold-interpenetrated grid-type network and the other has a non-interpenetrated grid network. After postsynthetic modification of the chiral dihydroxy groups of TADDOL units with Ti(OiPr)4, the materials are efficient and recyclable heterogeneous catalysts for asymmetric addition of diethylzinc to aldehydes with high enantioselectivity. The results reported here will greatly expand the scope of materials design and engineering for the creation of new types of functional porous materials."
"Dispersions of particles onto which reactive groups are bound give rise to inhomogeneous concentrations that may afford fundamentally different chemical behavior compared to the same molecular species dissolved in homogeneous solution. An example is bimolecular reactivity of complementary-functionalized particles, whereby interparticle contact is expected to promote fast kinetics localized to the interface, while exhibiting essentially no reactivity elsewhere. Such materials may exhibit unique properties analogous to blood clotting and thereby be useful in self-healing applications. Here, we demonstrate a radical polymerization reaction whose initiation is controlled by the physical proximity of two complementary co-initiators bound to a substrate and/or polymer beads. Polymerization of the surrounding acrylate monomer only occurs when interfaces functionalized with dimethylaniline encounter interfaces bearing benzoyl peroxide. At the interface of the complementary-functionalized beads, polymerization affords a \xe2\x80\x9cclot-like\xe2\x80\x9d scaffold of beads and polymer. Interestingly, such a scaffold is only attained when the beads are in a quiescent state. These findings open the way to the design of spatially controlled dual initiator systems and novel self-healing strategies and motifs."
"The reaction of 1-(trifluoromethyl)alkenes (CF3CH=CHR) with arylboroxines (ArBO)3 in the presence of a chiral diene-rhodium catalyst gave high yields of chiral 1,1-difluoroalkenes (CF2=CHC*HArR) with high enantioselectivity (\xe2\x89\xa595% ee). The reaction is assumed to proceed through \xce\xb2-fluoride elimination of a \xce\xb2,\xce\xb2,\xce\xb2-trifluoroalkylrhodium intermediate that is generated by arylrhodation of the 1-(trifluoromethyl)alkene."
"Metallomacromolecular architectural conversion is expanded by the characterization of three different structures. A quantitative, single-step, self-assembly of a shape-persistent monomer, containing a flexible crown ether moiety, gives an initial Archimedean-based cuboctahedron that has been unequivocally characterized by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and collision cross section analysis. Both dilution and exchange of counterions, transforms this cuboctahedron into two identical octahedrons, which upon further dilution convert into four, superposed, bistrianglar complexes; increasing the concentration reverses the process. Ion binding studies using the cuboctahedral cage were undertaken."
"A Cu-catalyzed selective aerobic heterocoupling of terminal alkynes is disclosed, which enables the synthesis of a broad range of unsymmetrical 1,3-diynes in good to excellent yields. The results disprove the long-held belief that homocouplings are exclusively favored in the Glaser\xe2\x80\x93Hay reaction."
"The reactivity of the \xe2\x80\x9cmasked\xe2\x80\x9d terminal nickel sulfide complex, [K(18-crown-6)][(LtBu)NiII(S)] (LtBu = {(2,6-iPr2C6H3)NC(tBu)}2CH), with the biologically important small molecules CO and NO, was surveyed. [K(18-crown-6)][(LtBu)NiII(S)] reacts with carbon monoxide (CO) via addition across the Ni\xe2\x80\x93S bond to give a carbonyl sulfide complex, [K(18-crown-6)][(LtBu)NiII(S,C:\xce\xb72-COS)] (1). Additionally, [K(18-crown-6)][(LtBu)NiII(S)] reacts with nitric oxide (NO) to yield a nickel nitrosyl, [(LtBu)Ni(NO)] (2), and a perthionitrite anion, [K(18-crown-6)][SSNO] (3). The isolation of 3 from this reaction confirms, for the first time, that transition metal sulfides can react with NO to form the biologically important [SSNO]\xe2\x88\x92 anion."
"The origins of the high enantioselectivity of chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed oxetane desymmetrizations were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Distortion of the catalyst structure, caused by steric crowding in the catalyst pocket of one enantiomeric transition state, is the main cause for stereochemical preference. A general model was developed to assist in the rational design of new catalysts for related transformations."
"Mixed tin (Sn)\xe2\x80\x93lead (Pb) perovskites with high Sn content exhibit low bandgaps suitable for fabricating the bottom cell of perovskite-based tandem solar cells. In this work, we report on the fabrication of efficient mixed Sn\xe2\x80\x93Pb perovskite solar cells using precursors combining formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3) and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). The best-performing cell fabricated using a (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 absorber with an absorption edge of \xe2\x88\xbc1.2 eV achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.08 (15.00)% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.795 (0.799) V, a short-circuit current density of 26.86(26.82) mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 70.6(70.0)% when measured under forward (reverse) voltage scan. The average PCE of 50 cells we have fabricated is 14.39 \xc2\xb1 0.33%, indicating good reproducibility."
"Total syntheses of oridamycin A, triptoquinones B and C, and isoiresin are accomplished from a common intermediate prepared via iridium-catalyzed alcohol C\xe2\x80\x93H tert-(hydroxy)prenylation - a byproduct-free process that forms an all-carbon quaternary stereocenter with excellent control of diastereo- and enantioselectivity."
"Mitophagy is a process in which cells remove dysfunctional mitochondria and recycle their constituents in a lysosome-dependent manner. To probe this process, two different fluorescent dyes specific for mitochondria and lysosomes, respectively, are often used in combination. However, current fluorescent dyes for lysosomes cannot distinguish mitochondria-containing autolysosomes from other lysosomes. Therefore, we herein report a cyanine dye, HQO, which can simultaneously probe mitochondria and autolysosomes in live cells by exhibiting different fluorescence properties. HQO selectively accumulates in mitochondria but then transforms to the protonated HQOH+ form with the decrease of pH when dysfunctional mitochondria evolve into autolysosomes. Since HQO and HQOH+ exhibit different absorption and emission with Ex/Em at 530/650 and 710/750 nm, respectively, in a low polarity environment, such as that found in micelles, they are uniquely suited to monitor mitophagy with the ability to distinguish autolysosomes from other lysosomes."
"Discerning the factors that control the reactivity of high-valent metal\xe2\x80\x93oxo species is critical to both an understanding of metalloenzyme reactivity and related transition metal catalysts. Computational studies have suggested that an excited higher spin state in a number of metal\xe2\x80\x93oxo species can provide a lower energy barrier for oxidation reactions, leading to the conclusion that this unobserved higher spin state complex should be considered as the active oxidant. However, testing these computational predictions by experiment is difficult and has rarely been accomplished. Herein, we describe a detailed computational study on the role of spin state in the reactivity of a high-valent manganese(V)\xe2\x80\x93oxo complex with para-Z-substituted thioanisoles and utilize experimental evidence to distinguish between the theoretical results. The calculations show an unusual change in mechanism occurs for the dominant singlet spin state that correlates with the electron-donating property of the para-Z substituent, while this change is not observed on the triplet spin state. Minimum energy crossing point calculations predict small spin\xe2\x80\x93orbit coupling constants making the spin state change from low spin to high spin unlikely. The trends in reactivity for the para-Z-substituted thioanisole derivatives provide an experimental measure for the spin state reactivity in manganese\xe2\x80\x93oxo corrolazine complexes. Hence, the calculations show that the V-shaped Hammett plot is reproduced by the singlet surface but not by the triplet state trend. The substituent effect is explained with valence bond models, which confirm a change from an electrophilic to a nucleophilic mechanism through a change of substituent."
"Mimicking the diverse glyco-conjugate structures in nature is always the dream of scientists. Right now, hierarchical self-assembled structures of natural conjugates of peptides and sugars could not easily be achieved via linear glycopolypeptide with monosaccharides as attachments. In this work, by using a series of well-designed alternating amphiphilic glycopolypeptide brushes (AAGBs) with pendants of glycodendrons and short peptides, various self-assembled morphologies were achieved, including nanowires, nanoribbon, and compound micelles mainly depending on the number ratio of the sugar units to the amino acids species (S/F). Among these morphologies, nanowire attracted our great attention. TEM studies demonstrated that it is formed via a hierarchical self-assembly, i.e., a series of successive processes, including micellization, micelles alignment forming nanofilament, branching of the nanofilaments by micelles, and finally nanowire formation. As far as we know, such hierarchical self-assembly process with high complexity has not been observed in literature for glycopolypeptides even polypeptides, which will deepen our understanding on self-assembly mechanism of natural glyco-conjugates and expand the library of biomimetic materials."
"Direct catalytic methane functionalization, a \xe2\x80\x9cdream reaction\xe2\x80\x9d, is typically characterized by relatively low catalyst activities. This also holds for the \xce\xb72-(2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-bipyrimidyl)dichloroplatinum(II) [(bpym)PtCl2, 1] catalyst which oxidizes methane to methyl bisulfate in sulfuric acid. Nevertheless, it is arguably still one of the best systems for the partial oxidation of methane reported so far. Detailed studies of the dependence of activity on the SO3 concentration and the interplay with the solubility of different platinum compounds revealed potassium tetrachloroplatinate (K2PtCl4) as an extremely active, selective, and stable catalyst, reaching turnover frequencies (TOFs) of more than 25,000 h\xe2\x80\x931 in 20% oleum with selectivities above 98%. The TOFs are more than 3 orders of magnitude higher compared to the original report on (bpym)PtCl2 and easily reach or exceed those realized in commercial industrial processes, such as the Cativa process for the carbonylation of methanol. Also space-time-yields are on the order of large-scale commercialized processes."
"Primary photochemical events in the unusually thermostable proton pumping rhodopsin of Thermus thermophilus bacterium (TR) are reported for the first time. Internal conversion in this protein is shown to be significantly faster than in bacteriorhodopsin (BR), making it the most rapidly isomerizing microbial proton pump known. Internal conversion (IC) dynamics of TR and BR were recorded from room temperature to the verge of thermal denaturation at 70 \xc2\xb0C and found to be totally independent of temperature in this range. This included the well documented multiexponential nature of IC in BR, suggesting that assignment of this to ground state structural inhomogeneity needs revision. TR photodynamics were also compared with that of the phylogenetically more similar proton pump Gloeobacter rhodopsin (GR). Despite this similarity GR has poor thermal stability, and the excited state decays significantly more slowly and exhibits very prominent stretched exponential behavior. Coherent torsional wave-packets induced by impulsive photoexcitation of TR and GR show marked resemblance to each other in frequency and amplitude and differ strikingly from similar signatures in pump\xe2\x80\x93probe data of BR and other microbial retinal proteins. Possible correlations between IC rates and thermal stability and the promise of using torsional coherence signatures for understanding chromophore protein binding in microbial retinal proteins are discussed."
"Although it has been examined for decades, no general approach to catalysis of the inverse electron demand Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder reactions of heterocyclic azadienes has been introduced. Typically, additives such as Lewis acids lead to nonproductive consumption of the electron-rich dienophiles without productive activation of the electron-deficient heterocyclic azadienes. Herein, we report the first general method for catalysis of such cycloaddition reactions by using solvent hydrogen bonding of non-nucleophilic perfluoroalcohols, including hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and trifluoroethanol (TFE), to activate the electron-deficient heterocyclic azadienes. Its use in promoting the cycloaddition of 1,2,3-triazine 4 with enamine 3 as the key step of a concise total synthesis of methoxatin is described."
"By monitoring the temperature-dependent catalytic activity of single Au nanocatalysts for a fluorogenic reaction, we derive the activation energies via multiple methods for two sequential catalytic steps (product formation and dissociation) on single nanocatalysts. The wide distributions of activation energies across multiple individual nanocatalysts indicate a huge static heterogeneity among the individual nanocatalysts. The compensation effect and isokinetic relationship of catalytic reactions are observed at the single particle level. This study exemplifies another function of single-molecule nanocatalysis and improves our understanding of heterogeneous catalysis."
"Single crystals of Yb14-xRExMnSb11 (0 < x < 0.6, RE = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) were synthesized by Sn flux. The compounds are iso-structural with Ca14AlSb11 (I41/acd), and their compositions were determined by wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy. Yb14MnSb11 is described as a partially screened d-metal Kondo system with the isolated [MnSb4]9\xe2\x80\x93 tetrahedral cluster having a d5 + hole configuration that results in four unpaired electrons measured in the ferromagnetically ordered phase. All of the Yb atoms in Yb14MnSb11 are present as Yb2+, and the additional RE in Yb14-xRExMnSb11 is trivalent, contributing one additional electron to the structure and altering the magnetic properties. All compounds show ferromagnetic ordering in the range of 39\xe2\x80\x9352 K attributed to the [MnSb4]9\xe2\x80\x93 magnetic moment. Temperature-dependent DC magnetization measurements of Yb14-xPrxMnSb11 (0.44 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 0.56) show a sharp downturn right below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. Single-crystal neutron diffraction shows that this downturn is caused by a spin reorientation of the [MnSb4]9\xe2\x80\x93 magnetic moments from the ab-plane to c-axis. The spin reorientation behavior, caused by large anisotropy, is also observed for similar x values of RE = Nd but not for RE = Sm or Gd at any value of x. In Pr-, Nd-, and Sm-substituted crystals, the saturation moments are consistent with \xe2\x88\xbc4 unpaired electrons attributed to [MnSb4]9\xe2\x80\x93, indicating that local moments of Pr, Nd, and Sm do not contribute to the ferromagnetic order. In the case of RE = Pr, this is confirmed by neutron diffraction. In contrast, the magnetic measurements of RE = Gd show that the moments of Gd ferromagnetically order with the moments of [MnSb4]9\xe2\x80\x93, and reduced screening of moments on Mn2+ is evident. The sensitive variation of magnetic behavior is attributed to the various RE substitutions resulting in different interactions of the 4f-orbitals with the 3d-orbitals of Mn in the [MnSb4]9\xe2\x80\x93 cluster conducted through 5p-orbitals of Sb."
"Achieving structurally well-defined catalytic species requires a fundamental understanding of surface chemistry. Detailed structural characterization of the catalyst binding sites in situ, such as single site catalysts on silica supports, is technically challenging or even unattainable. Octadecyltrioxysilane (OTOS) monolayers formed from octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) at the air\xe2\x80\x93liquid interface after hydrolysis and condensation at low pH were chosen as a model system of surface binding sites in silica-supported Zn2+ catalysts. We characterize the system by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectivity (XR), and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XFS). Previous X-ray and infrared surface studies of OTMS/OTOS films at the air\xe2\x80\x93liquid interface proposed the formation of polymer OTOS structures. According to our analysis, polymer formation is inconsistent with the X-ray observations and structural properties of siloxanes; it is energetically unfavorable and thus highly unlikely. We suggest an alternative mechanism of hydrolysis/condensation in OTMS leading to the formation of structurally allowed cyclic trimers with the six-membered siloxane rings, which explain well both the X-ray and infrared results. XR and XFS consistently demonstrate that tetrahedral [Zn(NH3)4]2+ ions bind to hydroxyl groups of the film at a stoichiometric ratio of OTOS:Zn \xe2\x88\xbc 2:1. The high binding affinity of zinc ions to OTOS trimers suggests that the six-membered siloxane rings are binding locations for single site Zn/SiO2 catalysts. Our results show that OTOS monolayers may serve as a platform for studying silica surface chemistry or hydroxyl-mediated reactions."
"Rational optimization of catalytic performance has been one of the major challenges in catalysis. Here we report a bottom-up study on the ability of TiO2 and ZrO2 to optimize the CO2 conversion to methanol on Cu, using combined density functional theory (DFT) calculations, kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements, and steady-state flow reactor tests. The theoretical results from DFT and KMC agree with in situ DRIFTS measurements, showing that both TiO2 and ZrO2 help to promote methanol synthesis on Cu via carboxyl intermediates and the reverse water\xe2\x80\x93gas-shift (RWGS) pathway; the formate intermediates, on the other hand, likely act as a spectator eventually. The origin of the superior promoting effect of ZrO2 is associated with the fine-tuning capability of reduced Zr3+ at the interface, being able to bind the key reaction intermediates, e.g. *CO2, *CO, *HCO, and *H2CO, moderately to facilitate methanol formation. This study demonstrates the importance of synergy between theory and experiments to elucidate the complex reaction mechanisms of CO2 hydrogenation for the realization of a better catalyst by design."
"We introduce a strategy that expands the functionality of hemoproteins through orthogonal enzyme/heme pairs. By exploiting the ability of a natural heme transport protein, ChuA, to promiscuously import heme derivatives, we have evolved a cytochrome P450 (P450BM3) that selectively incorporates a nonproteinogenic cofactor, iron deuteroporphyrin IX (Fe-DPIX), even in the presence of endogenous heme. Crystal structures show that selectivity gains are due to mutations that introduce steric clash with the heme vinyl groups while providing a complementary binding surface for the smaller Fe-DPIX cofactor. Furthermore, the evolved orthogonal enzyme/cofactor pair is active in non-natural carbenoid-mediated olefin cyclopropanation. This methodology for the generation of orthogonal enzyme/cofactor pairs promises to expand cofactor diversity in artificial metalloenzymes."
"Metal-nitroxyl (M\xe2\x80\x93HNO/M\xe2\x80\x93NO\xe2\x80\x93) coordination units are found in denitrification enzymes of the global nitrogen cycle, and free HNO exhibits pharmacological properties related to cardiovascular physiology that are distinct from nitric oxide (NO). To elucidate the properties that control the binding and release of coordinated nitroxyl or its anion at these biological metal sites, we synthesized {CoNO}8 (1, 2) and {CoNO}9 (3, 4) complexes that contain diimine\xe2\x80\x93dipyrrolide supporting ligands. Experimental (NMR, IR, MS, EPR, XAS, XRD) and computational data (DFT) support an oxidation state assignment for 3 and 4 of high spin CoII (SCo = 3/2) coordinated to 3NO\xe2\x80\x93 (SNO = 1) for Stot = 1/2. As suggested by DFT, upon protonation, a spin transition occurs to generate a putative low spin CoII\xe2\x80\x931HNO (SCo = Stot = 1/2); the Co\xe2\x80\x93NO bond is \xe2\x88\xbc0.2 \xc3\x85 longer, more labile, and facilitates the release of HNO. This property was confirmed experimentally through the detection and quantification of N2O (\xe2\x88\xbc70% yield), a byproduct of the established HNO self-reaction (2HNO \xe2\x86\x92 N2O + H2O). Additionally, 3 and 4 function as HNO donors in aqueous media at pH 7.4 and react with known HNO targets, such as a water-soluble MnIII-porphyrin ([MnIII(TPPS)]3\xe2\x80\x93; TPPS = meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrinate) and ferric myoglobin (metMb) to quantitatively yield [Mn(TPPS)(NO)]4\xe2\x80\x93 and MbNO, respectively."
"Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)-terminated oligosaccharides are important signals for M6P-receptor-mediated targeting of newly synthesized hydrolases from Golgi to lysosomes, but the precise structural requirement for the M6P ligand\xe2\x80\x93receptor recognition has not been fully understood due to the difficulties in obtaining homogeneous M6P-containing glycoproteins. We describe here a chemoenzymatic synthesis of homogeneous phosphoglycoproteins carrying natural M6P-containing N-glycans. The method includes the chemical synthesis of glycan oxazolines with varied number and location of the M6P moieties and their transfer to the GlcNAc-protein by an endoglycosynthase to provide homogeneous M6P-containing glycoproteins. Simultaneous attachment of two M6P-oligosaccahrides to a cyclic polypeptide was also accomplished to yield bivalent M6P-glycopeptides. Surface plasmon resonance binding studies reveal that a single M6P moiety located at the low \xce\xb1-1,3-branch of the oligomannose context is sufficient for a high-affinity binding to receptor CI-MPR, while the presence of a M6P moiety at the \xce\xb1-1,6-branch is dispensable. In addition, a binding study with the bivalent cyclic and linear polypeptides reveals that a close proximity of two M6P-oligosaccharide ligands is critical to achieve high affinity for the CI-MPR receptor. Taken together, the present study indicates that the location and valency of the M6P moieties and the right oligosaccharide context are all critical for high-affinity binding with the major M6P receptor. The chemoenzymatic method described here provides a new avenue for glycosylation remodeling of recombinant enzymes to enhance the uptake and delivery of enzymes to lysosomes in enzyme replacement therapy  for the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases."
"Kinetic studies conducted under both catalytic and stoichiometric conditions were employed to investigate the reductive elimination of RuPhos (2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2\xe2\x80\xb2,6\xe2\x80\xb2-diisopropoxybiphenyl) based palladium amido complexes. These complexes were found to be the resting state in Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions for a range of aryl halides and diarylamines. Hammett plots demonstrated that Pd(II) amido complexes derived from electron-deficient aryl halides or electron-rich diarylamines undergo faster rates of reductive elimination. A Hammett study employing SPhos (2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2\xe2\x80\xb2,6\xe2\x80\xb2-dimethoxybiphenyl) and analogues of SPhos demonstrated that electron donation of the \xe2\x80\x9clower\xe2\x80\x9d aryl group is key to the stability of the amido complex with respect to reductive elimination. The rate of reductive elimination of an amido complex based on a BrettPhos-RuPhos hybrid ligand (2-(dicyclohexylphosphino)-3,6-dimethoxy-2\xe2\x80\xb2,6\xe2\x80\xb2-diisopropoxybiphenyl) demonstrated that the presence of the 3-methoxy substituent on the \xe2\x80\x9cupper\xe2\x80\x9d ring of the ligand slows the rate of reductive elimination. These studies indicate that reductive elimination occurs readily for more nucleophilic amines such as N-alkyl anilines, N,N-dialkyl amines, and primary aliphatic amines using this class of ligands."
"Single-nanoparticle (NP) combination chemotherapeutics are quickly emerging as attractive alternatives to traditional chemotherapy due to their ability to increase drug solubility, reduce off-target toxicity, enhance blood circulation lifetime, and increase the amount of drug delivered to tumors. In the case of NP-bound drugs, that is, NP-prodrugs, the current standard of practice is to assume that the subcellular mechanism of action for each drug released from the NP mirrors that of the unbound, free-drug. Here, we use an RNAi signature assay for the first time to examine the mechanism of action of multidrug-conjugated NP prodrugs relative to their small molecule prodrugs and native drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, the effective additive contribution of three different drugs in a single-NP platform is characterized. The results indicate that some platinum(IV) cisplatin prodrugs, although cytotoxic, may not have the expected mechanism of action for cisplatin. This insight was utilized to develop a novel platinum(IV) oxaliplatin prodrug and incorporate it into a three-drug-conjugated NP, where each drug\xe2\x80\x99s mechanism of action is preserved, to treat tumor-bearing mice with otherwise lethal levels of chemotherapy."
"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can destroy local tumors and minimize normal tissue damage, but is ineffective at eliminating metastases. Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has enjoyed recent success in the clinic, but only elicits limited rates of systemic antitumor response for most cancers due to insufficient activation of the host immune system. Here we describe a treatment strategy that combines PDT by a new chlorin-based nanoscale metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework (nMOF), TBC-Hf, and a small-molecule immunotherapy agent that inhibits indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), encapsulated in the nMOF channels to induce systemic antitumor immunity. The synergistic combination therapy achieved effective local and distant tumor rejection in colorectal cancer models. We detected increased T cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment after activation of the immune system with the combination of IDO inhibition by the small-molecule immunotherapy agent and immunogenic cell death induced by PDT. We also elucidated the underlying immunological mechanisms and revealed compensatory roles of neutrophils and B cells in presenting tumor-associated antigens to T cells in this combination therapy. We believe that nMOF-enabled PDT has the potential to significantly enhance checkpoint blockade cancer immunotherapy, affording clinical benefits for the treatment of many difficult-to-treat cancers."
"A novel approach to ambipolar semiconductors based on hydrogen-bonded complexes between a star-shaped tris(triazolyl)triazine and triphenylene-containing benzoic acids is described. The formation of 1:3 supramolecular complexes was evidenced by different techniques. Mesogenic driving forces played a decisive role in the formation of the hydrogen-bonded complexes in the bulk. All of the complexes formed by nonmesogenic components gave rise to hexagonal columnar (Colh) liquid crystal phases, which are stable at room temperature. In all cases, X-ray diffraction experiments supported by electron density distribution maps confirmed triphenylene/tris(triazolyl)triazine segregation into hexagonal sublattices and lattices, respectively, as well as remarkable intracolumnar order. These highly ordered nanostructures, obtained by the combined supramolecular H-bond/columnar liquid crystal approach, yielded donor/acceptor coaxial organization that is promising for the formation of ambipolar organic semiconductors with high mobilities, as indicated by charge transport measurements."
"This paper describes the photoinduced switching of conductance in tunneling junctions comprising self-assembled monolayers of a spiropyran moiety using eutectic Ga\xe2\x80\x93In top contacts. Despite separation of the spiropyran unit from the electrode by a long alkyl ester chain, we observe an increase in the current density J of a factor of 35 at 1 V when the closed form is irradiated with UV light to induce the ring-opening reaction, one of the highest switching ratios reported for junctions incorporating self-assembled monolayers. The magnitude of switching of hexanethiol mixed monolayers was higher than that of pure spiropyran monolayers. The first switching event recovers 100% of the initial value of J and in the mixed-monolayers subsequent dampening is not the result of degradation of the monolayer. The observation of increased conductivity is supported by zero-bias DFT calculations showing a change in the localization of the density of states near the Fermi level as well as by simulated transmission spectra revealing positive resonances that broaden and shift toward the Fermi level in the open form."
"Following the recent discovery that heme proteins can catalyze the cyclopropanation of styrenyl olefins with high efficiency and selectivity, interest in developing new enzymes for a variety of non-natural carbene transfer reactions has burgeoned. The fact that diazo compounds and other carbene precursors are known mechanism-based inhibitors of P450s, however, led us to investigate if they also interfere with this new enzyme function. We present evidence for two inactivation pathways that are operative during cytochrome P450-catalyzed cyclopropanation. Using a combination of UV\xe2\x80\x93vis, mass spectrometry, and proteomic analyses, we show that the heme cofactor and several nucleophilic side chains undergo covalent modification by ethyl diazoacetate (EDA). Substitution of two of the affected residues with less-nucleophilic amino acids led to a more than twofold improvement in cyclopropanation performance (total TTN). Elucidating the inactivation pathways of heme protein-based carbene transfer catalysts should aid in the optimization of this new biocatalytic function."
"The non-B DNA structures formed by short tandem repeats on the nascent strand during DNA replication have been proposed to be the structural intermediates that lead to repeat expansion mutations. Tetranucleotide TTTA and CCTG repeat expansions have been known to cause reduction in biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus and myotonic dystrophy type 2 in human, respectively. In this study, we report the first three-dimensional minidumbbell (MDB) structure formed by natural DNA sequences containing two TTTA or CCTG repeats. The formation of MDB provides possible pathways for strand slippage to occur, which ultimately leads to repair escape and thus expansion mutations. Our result here shows that MDB is a highly compact structure composed of two type II loops. In addition to the typical stabilizing interactions in type II loops, MDB shows extensive stabilizing forces between the two loops, including two distinctive modes of interactions between the minor groove residues. The formation of MDB enriches the structural diversity of natural DNA sequences, reveals the importance of loop\xe2\x80\x93loop interactions in unusual DNA structures, and provides insights into novel mechanistic pathways of DNA repeat expansion mutations."
"Glycoconjugation is a promising strategy for specific targeting of cancer. In this study, we investigated the effect of d-glucose substitution position on the biological activity of glucose\xe2\x80\x93platinum conjugates (Glc-Pts). We synthesized and characterized all possible positional isomers (C1\xce\xb1, C1\xce\xb2, C2, C3, C4, and C6) of a Glc-Pt. The synthetic routes presented here could, in principle, be extended to prepare glucose conjugates with different active ingredients, other than platinum. The biological activities of the compounds were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. We discovered that varying the position of substitution of d-glucose alters not only the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity profile but also the GLUT1 specificity of resulting glycoconjugates, where GLUT1 is glucose transporter 1. The C1\xce\xb1- and C2-substituted Glc-Pts (1\xce\xb1 and 2) accumulate in cancer cells most efficiently compared to the others, whereas the C3-Glc-Pt (3) is taken up least efficiently. Compounds 1\xce\xb1 and 2 are more potent compared to 3 in DU145 cells. The \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-anomers of the C1-Glc-Pt also differ significantly in their cellular uptake and activity profiles. No significant differences in uptake of the Glc-Pts were observed in non-cancerous RWPE2 cells. The GLUT1 specificity of the Glc-Pts was evaluated by determining the cellular uptake in the absence and in the presence of the GLUT1 inhibitor cytochalasin B, and by comparing their anticancer activity in DU145 cells and a GLUT1 knockdown cell line. The results reveal that C2-substituted Glc-Pt 2 has the highest GLUT1-specific internalization, which also reflects the best cancer-targeting ability. In a syngeneic breast cancer mouse model overexpressing GLUT1, compound 2 showed antitumor efficacy and selective uptake in tumors with no observable toxicity. This study thus reveals the synthesis of all positional isomers of d-glucose substitution for platinum warheads with detailed glycotargeting characterization in cancer."
"Redox-active support materials can help reduce the noble-metal loading of a solid chemical catalyst while offering electronic catalyst\xe2\x80\x93support interactions beneficial for catalyst durability. This is well known in heterogeneous gas-phase catalysis but much less discussed for electrocatalysis at electrified liquid\xe2\x80\x93solid interfaces. Here, we demonstrate experimental evidence for electronic catalyst\xe2\x80\x93support interactions in electrochemical environments and study their role and contribution to the corrosion stability of catalyst/support couples. Electrochemically oxidized Ir oxide nanoparticles, supported on high surface area carbons and oxides, were selected as model catalyst/support systems for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). First, the electronic, chemical, and structural state of the catalyst/support couple was compared using XANES, EXAFS, TEM, and depth-resolved XPS. While carbon-supported oxidized Ir particle showed exclusively the redox state (+4), the Ir/IrOx/ATO system exhibited evidence of metal/metal\xe2\x80\x93oxide support interactions (MMOSI) that stabilized the metal particles on antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) in sustained lower Ir oxidation states (Ir3.2+). At the same time, the growth of higher valent Ir oxide layers that compromise catalyst stability was suppressed. Then the electrochemical stability and the charge-transfer kinetics of the electrocatalysts were evaluated under constant current and constant potential conditions, where the analysis of the metal dissolution confirmed that the ATO support mitigates Irz+ dissolution thanks to a stronger MMOSI effect. Our findings raise the possibility that MMOSI effects in electrochemistry\xe2\x80\x94largely neglected in the past\xe2\x80\x94may be more important for a detailed understanding of the durability of oxide-supported nanoparticle OER catalysts than previously thought."
"The components of a 4:1 mixture of Rh(III)Cl tetrakis(4-methylphenyl)porphyrin 1 and a bowl-shaped tetra(4-pyridyl)cavitand 4 self-assemble into a 4:1 complex 14\xe2\x80\xa24 via Rh\xe2\x80\x93pyridyl axial coordination bonds. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and variable-temperature (VT) 1H NMR study of 14\xe2\x80\xa24 indicated that 14\xe2\x80\xa24 behaves as a quadruple interlocking gear with an inner space, wherein (i) four subunits-1 are gear wheels and four p-pyridyl groups in subunit-4 are axes of gear wheels, (ii) one subunit-1 and two adjacent subunits-1 interlock with one another cooperatively, and (iii) four subunits-1 in 14\xe2\x80\xa24 rotate quickly at 298 K on the NMR time scale. Together, the extremely strong porphyrin-Rh\xe2\x80\x93pyridyl axial coordination bond, the rigidity of the methylene-bridge cavitand as a scaffold of the pyridyl axes, and the cruciform arrangement of the interdigitating p-tolyl groups as the teeth moiety of the gear wheels in the assembling 14-unit make 14\xe2\x80\xa24 function as a quadruple interlocking gear in solution. The gear function of 14\xe2\x80\xa24 was also supported by the rotation behaviors of other 4:1 complexes: 24\xe2\x80\xa24 and 34\xe2\x80\xa24 obtained from Rh(III)Cl tetrakis[4-(4-methylphenyl)phenyl]porphyrin 2 or Rh(III)Cl tetrakis(3,5-dialkoxyphenyl)porphyrin 3 and 4 also served as quadruple interlocking gears, whereas 14\xe2\x80\xa25 obtained from 1 and tetrakis[4-(4-pyridyl)phenyl]cavitand 5 did not behave as a gear. The results of activation parameters (\xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7, \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7, and \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7) obtained from Eyring plots based on line-shape analysis of the VT 1H NMR spectra of 14\xe2\x80\xa24, 24\xe2\x80\xa24, and 34\xe2\x80\xa24 also support the interlocking rotation (geared coupled rotation) mechanism."
"Uranium is important in the nuclear fuel cycle both as an energy source and as radioactive waste. It is of vital importance to recover uranium from nuclear waste solutions for further treatment and disposal. Herein we present the first chalcogenide example, (Me2NH2)1.33(Me3NH)0.67Sn3S7\xc2\xb71.25H2O (FJSM-SnS), in which organic amine cations can be used for selective UO22+ ion-exchange. The UO22+-exchange kinetics perfectly conforms to pseudo-second-order reaction, which is observed for the first time in a chalcogenide ion-exchanger. This reveals the chemical adsorption process and its ion-exchange mechanism. FJSM-SnS has excellent pH stability in both strongly acidic and basic environments (pH = 2.1\xe2\x80\x9311), with a maximum uranium-exchange capacity of 338.43 mg/g. It can efficiently capture UO22+ ions in the presence of high concentrations of Na+, Ca2+, or HCO3\xe2\x80\x93 (the highest distribution coefficient Kd value reached 4.28 \xc3\x97 104 mL/g). The material is also very effective in removing of trace levels of U in the presence of excess Na+ (the relative amounts of U removed are close to 100%). The UO22+\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7S2\xe2\x80\x93 interactions are the basis for the high selectivity. Importantly, the uranyl ion in the exchanged products could be easily eluted with an environmentally friendly method, by treating the UO22+-laden materials with a concentrated KCl solution. These advantages coupled with the very high loading capacity, low cost, environmentally friendly nature, and facile synthesis make FJSM-SnS a new promising remediation material for removal of radioactive U from nuclear waste solutions."
"Nanostructured carbon materials have received considerable attention due to their special physicochemical properties. Herein, ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) with two-dimension (2D) hexagonal mesostructure and unique buckled large mesopores have successfully been synthesized via a micelle fusion\xe2\x80\x93aggregation assembly method by using poly(ethylene oxide)-block-polystyrene (PEO-b-PS) diblock copolymers as a template and resorcinol-based phenolic resin as a carbon precursor. The obtained ordered mesoporous carbons possess unique fiber-like morphology, specific surface area of 571\xe2\x80\x93880 m2/g, pore volume of 0.54 cm3/g and large mesopores (up to 36.3 nm) and high density of active sites (i.e., carboxylic groups) of 0.188/nm2. Gas sensor based on the ordered mesoporous carbons exhibits an excellent performance in sensing NH3 at a low temperature with fast response (<2 min), ultralow limit of detection (<1 ppm), and good selectivity, due to the large pore sizes, high surface area and rich active sites in the carbon pore walls."
"Photolysis (\xce\xbb > 472 nm) of 2-diazo-3-pentyne (11) affords triplet 1,3-dimethylpropynylidene (MeC3Me, 33), which was characterized spectroscopically in cryogenic matrices. The infrared, electronic absorption, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of MeC3Me (33) are compared with those of the parent system (HC3H) to ascertain the effect of alkyl substituents on delocalized carbon chains of this type. Quantum chemical calculations (CCSD(T)/ANO1) predict an unsymmetrical equilibrium structure for triplet MeC3Me (33), but they also reveal a very shallow potential energy surface. The experimental IR spectrum of triplet MeC3Me (33) is best interpreted in terms of a quasilinear, axially symmetric structure. EPR spectra yield zero-field splitting parameters that are typical for triplet carbenes with axial symmetry (|D/hc|  =  0.63 cm\xe2\x80\x931, |E/hc| = \xe2\x88\xbc 0 cm\xe2\x80\x931), while theoretical analysis suggests that the methyl substituents confer significant spin polarization to the carbon chain. Upon irradiation into the near-UV electronic absorption (\xce\xbbmax 350 nm), MeC3Me (33) undergoes 1,2-hydrogen migration to yield pent-1-en-3-yne (4), a photochemical reaction that is typical of carbenes bearing a methyl substituent. This facile process apparently precludes photoisomerization to other interesting C5H6 isomers, in contrast to the rich photochemistry of the parent C3H2 system."
"Primary arylamines are an important unit broadly found in synthetic, biological, and materials science. Herein we describe the development of a (NHC)Cu system that mediates a direct C\xe2\x80\x93H amidation of (hetero)arenes by using N-chlorocarbamates or their sodio derivatives as the practical amino sources. A facile stoichiometric reaction of reactive copper-aryl intermediates with the amidating reagent led us to isolate key copper arylcarbamate species with the formation of a C\xe2\x80\x93N bond. The use of tBuONa base made this transformation catalytic under mild conditions. The present (NHC)Cu-catalyzed C\xe2\x80\x93H amidation works efficiently and selectively on a large scale over a range of arenes including polyfluorobenzenes, azoles, and quinoline N-oxides. Deprotection of the newly installed carbamate groups such as Boc and Cbz was readily performed to afford the corresponding primary arylamines."
"We report rapid photoinitiated intracomplex electron transfer (ET) within a \xe2\x80\x9ccharge-disproportionated\xe2\x80\x9d myoglobin (Mb) dimer with greatly enhanced affinity. Two mutually supportive Brownian Dynamics (BD) interface redesign strategies, one a new \xe2\x80\x9cheme-filtering\xe2\x80\x9d approach, were employed to \xe2\x80\x9cbreak the symmetry\xe2\x80\x9d of a Mb homodimer by pairing Mb constructs with complementary highly positive and highly negative net surface charges, introduced through D/E \xe2\x86\x92 K and K \xe2\x86\x92 E mutations, respectively. BD simulations using a previously developed positive mutant, Mb(+6) = Mb(D44K/D60K/E85K), led to construction of the complementary negative mutant Mb(\xe2\x88\x926) = Mb(K45E, K63E, K95E). Simulations predict the pair will form a well-defined complex comprising a tight ensemble of conformations with nearly parallel hemes, at a metal\xe2\x80\x93metal distance \xe2\x88\xbc18\xe2\x80\x9319 \xc3\x85. Upon expression and X-ray characterization of the partners, BD predictions were verified through ET photocycle measurements enabled by Zn-deuteroporphyrin substitution, forming the [ZnMb(\xe2\x88\x926), Fe3+Mb(+6)] complex. Triplet ET quenching shows charge disproportionation increases the binding constant by no less than \xe2\x88\xbc5 orders of magnitude relative to wild-type Mb values. All progress curves for charge separation (CS) and charge recombination (CR) are reproduced by a generalized kinetic model for the interprotein ET photocycle. The intracomplex ET rate constants for both CS and CR are increased by over 5 orders of magnitude, and their viscosity independence is indicative of true interprotein ET, rather than dynamic gating as seen in previous studies. The complex displays an unprecedented timecourse for CR of the CS intermediate I. After a laser flash, I forms through photoinduced CS, accumulates to a maximum concentration, then dies away through CR. However, before completely disappearing, I reappears without another flash and reaches a second maximum before disappearing completely."
"The network of activator protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that underpin transcription initiation is poorly defined, particularly in the cellular context. The transient nature of these contacts and the often low abundance of the participants present significant experimental hurdles. Through the coupling of in vivo covalent chemical capture and shotgun LC-MS/MS (MuDPIT) analysis, we can trap the PPIs of transcriptional activators in a cellular setting and identify the binding partners in an unbiased fashion. Using this approach, we discover that the prototypical activators Gal4 and VP16 target the Snf1 (AMPK) kinase complex via direct interactions with both the core enzymatic subunit Snf1 and the exchangeable subunit Gal83. Further, we use a tandem reversible formaldehyde and irreversible covalent chemical capture approach (TRIC) to capture the Gal4-Snf1 interaction at the Gal1 promoter in live yeast. Together, these data support a critical role for activator PPIs in both the recruitment and positioning of important enzymatic complexes at a gene promoter and represent a technical advancement in the discovery of new cellular binding targets of transcriptional activators."
"Electron-acceptor-substituted aryl azides and \xce\xb1-diazo carboxylic esters are used as substrates for visible-light-activated asymmetric \xce\xb1-amination and \xce\xb1-alkylation, respectively, of 2-acyl imidazoles catalyzed by a chiral-at-metal rhodium-based Lewis acid in combination with a photoredox sensitizer. This novel proton- and redox-neutral method provides yields of up to 99% and excellent enantioselectivities of up to >99% ee with broad functional group compatibility. Mechanistic investigations suggest that an intermediate rhodium enolate complex acts as a reductive quencher to initiate a radical process with the aryl azides and \xce\xb1-diazo carboxylic esters serving as precursors for nitrogen and carbon-centered radicals, respectively. This is the first report on using aryl azides and \xce\xb1-diazo carboxylic esters as substrates for asymmetric catalysis under photoredox conditions. These reagents have the advantage that molecular nitrogen is the leaving group and sole byproduct in this reaction."
"[4]Rotaxanes featuring three axles threaded through a single ring have been prepared through active metal template synthesis. Nickel-catalyzed sp3\xe2\x80\x93sp3 homocouplings of alkyl bromide \xe2\x80\x9chalf-threads\xe2\x80\x9d through 37- and 38-membered 2,2\xe2\x80\xb2:6\xe2\x80\xb2,2\xe2\x80\xb3-terpyridyl macrocycles generate triply threaded [4]rotaxanes in up to 11% yield. An analogous 39-membered macrocycle produced no rotaxane products under similar conditions. The constitutions of the [4]rotaxanes were determined by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Doubly threaded [3]rotaxanes were also obtained from the reactions but no [2]rotaxanes were isolated, suggesting that upon demetalation the axle of a singly threaded rotaxane can slip through a macrocycle that is sufficiently large to accommodate three threads."
"The reduced and oxidized states of an open-shell diindeno[b,i]anthracene (DIAn) derivative have been investigated by experimental and theoretical techniques. As a result of moderate biradical character and the ability of cyclopenta-fused scaffolds to stabilize both positive and negative charges, DIAn exhibits rich redox chemistry with four observable and isolable charged states. Structural and electronic properties of the DIAn system are brought to light by UV\xe2\x80\x93vis\xe2\x80\x93NIR and Raman spectroelectrochemical measurements. Aromatization of the diindeno-fused anthracene core upon successive single-electron injections is revealed through single-crystal X-ray diffraction of radical anion and dianion salts. We present a rare case where the pseudoaromatic/quinoidal ground state of a neutral biradical polycyclic hydrocarbon leads to a stable cascade of five redox states. Our detailed investigation of the transformation of molecular structure along all four redox events provides a clearer understanding of the nature of charge carriers in ambipolar organic field-effect transistors."
"The modular synthesis of a library containing seven self-assembling amphiphilic Janus dendrimers is reported. Three of these molecules contain environmentally friendly chiral-racemic fluorinated dendrons in their hydrophobic part (RF), one contains achiral hydrogenated dendrons (RH), while one denoted hybrid Janus dendrimer, contains a combination of chiral-racemic fluorinated and achiral hydrogenated dendrons (RHF) in its hydrophobic part. Two Janus dendrimers contain either chiral-racemic fluorinated dendrons and a green fluorescent dye conjugated to its hydrophilic part (RF-NBD) or achiral hydrogenated and a red fluorescent dye in its hydrophilic part (RH-RhB). These RF, RH, and RHF Janus dendrimers self-assembled into unilamellar or onion-like soft vesicular dendrimersomes (DSs), with similar thicknesses to biological membranes by simple injection from ethanol solution into water or buffer. Since RF and RH dendrons are not miscible, RF-NBD and RH-RhB were employed to investigate by fluorescence microscopy the self-sorting and coassembly of RF and RH as well as of phospholipids into hybrid DSs mediated by the hybrid hydrogenated-fluorinated RHF Janus dendrimer. The hybrid RHF Janus dendrimer coassembled with both RF and RH. Three-component hybrid DSs containing RH, RF, and RHF were formed when the proportion of RHF was higher than 40%. With low concentration of RHF and in its absence, RH and RF self-sorted into individual RH or RF DSs. Phospholipids were also coassembled with hybrid RHF Janus dendrimers. The simple synthesis and self-assembly of DSs and hybrid DSs, their similar thickness with biological membranes and their imaging by fluorescence and 19F-MRI make them important tools for synthetic biology."
"Multisubstituted tropanes and indolizidines have been prepared with high regio- and stereoselectivity by the [3+2] cycloaddition of unstabilized azomethine ylides generated from readily prepared trimethylsilyl-substituted 1,2-dihydropyridines via protonation or alkylation followed by desilylation. Starting from 1,2-dihydropyridines bearing a ring trimethylsilyl substituent at the 6-position, an intermolecular alkylation/desilylation provides endocyclic unstabilized ylides that successfully undergo cycloaddition with a range of symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkyne and alkene dipolarophiles to afford densely substituted tropanes incorporating quaternary carbons in good yields and with high regio- and stereoselectivity. Additionally, an intramolecular alkylation/desilylation/cycloaddition sequence provides convenient and rapid entry to bridged tricyclic tropane skeletons, allowing for five contiguous carbon stereocenters to be set in a single experimental operation and under mild conditions. Starting from 1,2-dihydropyridines with trimethylsilylmethyl groups on nitrogen, protonation followed by desilylation generates exocyclic unstabilized ylides that undergo cycloaddition with unsymmetrical alkynes to give indolizidines with good regio- and stereoselectivity. N-Trimethylsilylmethyl-1,2-dihydropyridines can also be alkylated and subsequently desilylated to give endocyclic unstabilized ylides that undergo intermolecular cycloadditions with carbonyl compounds to give bicyclic oxazolidine products in good overall yields. Moreover, an intramolecular alkylation/desilylation/cycloaddition sequence with the N-trimethylsilylmethyl-1,2-dihydropyridines affords tricyclic indolizidines that incorporate quaternary carbons and up to five stereocenters with good to excellent regio- and diastereoselectivity."
"Paraherquonin (1), a fungal meroterpenoid produced by Penicillium brasilianum NBRC 6234, possesses a unique, highly congested hexacyclic molecular architecture. Here we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 (the prh cluster) and elucidated the pathway up to berkeleydione (2), which serves as the key intermediate for the biosynthesis of 1 as well as many other meroterpenoids. Interestingly, the nonheme iron and \xce\xb1-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase PrhA constructs the cycloheptadiene moiety to afford 2 from preaustinoid A1 (6), probably via the homoallyl-homoallyl radical rearrangement. Additionally, another fungal strain, P.\xc2\xa0brasilianum MG11, which produces acetoxydehydroaustin instead of 1, was found to have a gene cluster nearly identical to the prh cluster. The dioxygenase encoded by the cluster shares 92% sequence identity with PrhA, and also accepts 6 but produces preaustinoid A3 (17) with a spiro-lactone system, generating a diverging point for the two different meroterpenoid pathways in the same species."
"The final step in the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid antibiotic pentalenolactone (1) is the highly unusual cytochrome P450-catalyzed, oxidative rearrangement of pentalenolactone F (2), involving the transient generation and rearrangement of a neopentyl cation. In Streptomyces arenae this reaction is catalyzed by CYP161C2 (PntM), with highly conserved orthologs being present in at least 10 other Actinomycetes. Crystal structures of substrate-free PntM, as well as PntM with bound substrate 2, product 1, and substrate analogue 6,7-dihydropentalenolactone F (7) revealed interactions of bound ligand with three residues, F232, M77, and M81 that are unique to PntM and its orthologs and absent from essentially all other P450s. Site-directed mutagenesis, ligand-binding measurements, steady-state kinetics, and reaction product profiles established there is no special stabilization of reactive cationic intermediates by these side chains. Reduced substrate analogue 7 did not undergo either oxidative rearrangement or simple hydroxylation, suggesting that the C1 carbocation is not anchimerically stabilized by the 6,7-double bond of 2. The crystal structures also revealed plausible proton relay networks likely involved in the generation of the key characteristic P450 oxidizing species, Compound I, and in mediating stereospecific deprotonation of H-3re of the substrate. We conclude that the unusual carbocation intermediate results from outer shell electron transfer from the transiently generated C1 radical to the tightly paired heme-\xe2\x80\xa2Fe3+\xe2\x80\x93OH radical species. The oxidative electron transfer is kinetically dominant as a result of the unusually strong steric barrier to oxygen rebound to the neopentyl center C-1si, which is flanked on each neighboring carbon by syn-axial substituents."
Self-coupled copper sulfide polymorphs are formed through a simple route by metal ion precursors.
"This Perspective illustrates the defining characteristics of free radical chemistry, beginning with its rich and storied history. Studies from our laboratory are discussed along with recent developments emanating from others in this burgeoning area. The practicality and chemoselectivity of radical reactions enable rapid access to molecules of relevance to drug discovery, agrochemistry, material science, and other disciplines. Thus, these reactive intermediates possess inherent translational potential, as they can be widely used to expedite scientific endeavors for the betterment of humankind."
"An iridium photocatalyst and visible light facilitate a room temperature, nickel-catalyzed coupling of (hetero)aryl bromides with activated \xce\xb1-heterosubstituted or benzylic C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H bonds. Mechanistic investigations on this unprecedented transformation have uncovered the possibility of an unexpected mechanism hypothesized to involve a Ni\xe2\x80\x93Br homolysis event from an excited-state nickel complex. The resultant bromine radical is thought to abstract weak C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H bonds to generate reactive alkyl radicals that can be engaged in Ni-catalyzed arylation. Evidence suggests that the iridium photocatalyst facilitates nickel excitation and bromine radical generation via triplet\xe2\x80\x93triplet energy transfer."
"Here we report the development of a C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H cross-coupling platform enabled by the catalytic generation of chlorine radicals by nickel and photoredox catalysis. Aryl chlorides serve as both cross-coupling partners and the chlorine radical source for the \xce\xb1-oxy C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H arylation of cyclic and acyclic ethers. Mechanistic studies suggest that photolysis of a Ni(III) aryl chloride intermediate, generated by photoredox-mediated single-electron oxidation, leads to elimination of a chlorine radical in what amounts to the sequential capture of two photons. Arylations of a benzylic C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H bond of toluene and a completely unactivated C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H bond of cyclohexane demonstrate the broad implications of this manifold for accomplishing numerous C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H bond functionalizations under exceptionally mild conditions."
"Small diameter single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) arrays with larger bandgap are more desirable as near-infrared optical absorbers for the fabrication of high performance photovoltaic and photodetector devices. We report herein a rational approach to selective growth of well-aligned subnanometer diameter (\xe2\x88\xbc84% between 0.75 and 0.95 nm) SWNT arrays with a density of 0.3\xe2\x80\x930.5 tubes/\xce\xbcm on quartz surfaces using solid Mo2C catalysts for short-time growth by low carbon feeding in hydrogen-free CVD. These subnanometer diameter SWNTs have a narrow chirality distribution (the ratio of (8,4), (8,5) and (7,6) is higher than 73%). During nanotube growth, only small size Mo nanoparticles are carbonized into stable Mo2C for catalyzing the growth of SWNTs through low carbon feeding rate over short time in the hydrogen-free environment, whereas larger catalysts are inactive due to underfeeding. Meanwhile, solid Mo2C catalysts are effective in reducing the chirality distributions of the as-grown SWNTs. Additionally, combining an annealing process after loading catalyst on the sapphire substrates, the average density is increased to \xe2\x88\xbc15 tubes/\xce\xbcm while maintaining small diameter and narrow chirality distribution. Our results offer more choices for structurally controlled growth of aligned-SWNTs, with potential applications in nanoelectronics."
"Transition metal catalyzed regioselective amination of the cage B(4)\xe2\x80\x93H bond in o-carboranes has been achieved for the first time using O-benzoyl hydroxylamines or organic azides as the amination reagents, leading to the preparation of a series of tertiary and secondary carboranyl amines. Both amination reactions proceeded under mild conditions without the addition of any external oxidants. Hydrogenolysis of the resultant product 4-N(CH2Ph)2-o-carborane afforded the primary carboranyl amine, 4-amino-o-carborane, in quantitative yield."
"Biomolecules can act as functional templates for the organization of inorganic particles. Here we use two protein containers, engineered with opposite surface charge, as building blocks for the construction of a new type of biohybrid material. Binary structures with crystalline order were obtained, adopting a tetragonal lattice. Moreover, the cavity of the engineered protein containers can be filled with inorganic nanoparticles. The controlled assembly of these protein\xe2\x80\x93nanoparticle composites yields highly ordered binary nanoparticle superlattices as free-standing crystals, with up to a few hundred micrometers in size. Because the structure and lattice parameters of the protein\xe2\x80\x93nanoparticle crystals are independent of their nanoparticle cargo, the binary protein material may serve as a generally applicable matrix for the assembly of a variety of nanoparticles types."
"We demonstrate a strategy to trigger and finely control the assembly of supramolecular DNA nanostructures with pH. Control is achieved via a rationally designed strand displacement circuit that responds to pH and activates a downstream DNA tile self-assembly process. We observe that the DNA structures form under neutral/basic conditions, while the self-assembly process is suppressed under acidic conditions. The strategy presented here demonstrates a modular approach toward building systems capable of processing biochemical inputs and finely controlling the assembly of DNA-based nanostructures under isothermal conditions. In particular, the presented architecture is relevant for the development of complex DNA devices able to sense and respond to molecular markers associated with abnormal metabolism."
"We describe here three alkynyl substituted naphthalenes that display promising luminescence characteristics. Each compound is easily and efficiently synthesized in three steps by capitalizing on the hexadehydro-Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder (HDDA) cycloisomerization reaction in which an intermediate benzyne is captured by tetraphenylcyclopentadienone, a classical trap for benzyne itself. These compounds luminesce in the deep blue when stimulated either optically (i.e., photoluminescence in both solution and solid films) or electrically [in a light-emitting diode (LED)]. The photophysical properties are relatively insensitive to the electronic nature of the substituents (H, OMe, CO2Me) that define these otherwise identical compounds. Overall, our observations suggest that the twisted nature of the five adjacent aryl groups serves to minimize the intermolecular interaction between core naphthalene units in different sample morphologies. These compounds represent promising leads for the identification of others of value as the emissive component of organic LEDs (OLEDs)."
"Reaction of Ce(NO3)3(THF)4 with Li3(THF)3(NN\xe2\x80\xb23) (NN\xe2\x80\xb23 = N(CH2CH2NR)3, R = SitBuMe2) in Et2O, in the presence of 12-crown-4, results in the formation of [Li(12-crown-4)][(NN\xe2\x80\xb23)Ce(O)] (1) in 36% yield. This transformation proceeds via formation of a Ce(III) nitrate intermediate, [Li(12-crown-4)][(NN\xe2\x80\xb23)Ce(\xce\xba2-O2NO)] (2), which undergoes inner sphere nitrate reduction. In addition, reaction of 1 with tBuMe2SiCl results in the formation of (NN\xe2\x80\xb23)Ce(OSitBuMe2) (3), confirming the nucleophilic character of its oxo ligand. Natural bond orbital and quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules data reveal the Ce\xe2\x80\x93O interaction in 1 to be significantly covalent, and strikingly similar to analogous U\xe2\x80\x93O bonding."
"The use of the hypervalent iodine reagents in oxidative processes has become a staple in modern organic synthesis. Frequently, the reactivity of \xce\xbb3 iodanes is further enhanced by acids (Lewis or Br\xc3\xb8nsted). The origin of such activation, however, has remained elusive. Here, we use the common combination of PhI(OAc)2 with BF3\xc2\xb7Et2O as a model to fully explore this activation phenomenon. In addition to the spectroscopic assessment of the dynamic acid\xe2\x80\x93base interaction, for the first time the putative PIDA\xc2\xb7BF3 complex has been isolated and its structure determined by X-ray diffraction. Consequences of such activation are discussed from a structural and electronic (DFT) points of views, including the origins of the enhanced reactivity."
"In this work, a facile ion-pairing strategy for asymmetric synthesis of optically active negatively charged chiral metal nanoparticles using chiral ammonium cations is demonstrated. A new thiolated chiral three-concentric-shell cluster, [Ag28Cu12(SR)24]4\xe2\x80\x93, was first synthesized as a racemic mixture and characterized by single-crystal X-ray structure determination. Mass spectrometric measurements revealed relatively strong ion-pairing interactions between the anionic nanocluster and ammonium cations. Inspired by this observation, the as-prepared racemic mixture was separated into enantiomers by employing chiral quaternary ammonium salts as chiral resolution agents. Subsequently, direct asymmetric synthesis of optically active enantiomers of [Ag28Cu12(SR)24]4\xe2\x80\x93 was achieved by using appropriate chiral ammonium cations (such as N-benzylcinchoninium vs N-benzylcinchonidinium) in the cluster synthesis. These simple strategies, ion-pairing enantioseparation and direct asymmetric synthesis using chiral counterions, may be of general use in preparing chiral metal nanoparticles."
"Nanoparticle (NP) impacts on electrode surfaces has become an important method for analyzing the properties and activity of individual NPs, by either (i) electrocatalytic reactions or (ii) volumetric (dissolution) analyses. Using Au NPs as an exemplar system, this contribution shows that it is possible to detect surface oxide formation at individual NPs, which can occur on a rapid time scale (few \xce\xbcs). The charge associated with this \xe2\x80\x9csurface oxidation method\xe2\x80\x9d can be used for sizing (with results that are comparable to TEM) despite charges of only fC being measured. This platform further allows the role of surface oxides in electrocatalysis to be elucidated, with the time scale of oxide formation being controllable (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9ctunable\xe2\x80\x9d) via the applied potential, as illustrated through studies of borohydride and hydrazine electro-oxidation. Finally, all of these studies are carried out on an oxide-covered Au substrate, which can be prepared and regenerated straightforwardly on an Au electrode, through the applied potential."
"The use of noncovalent interactions to direct transition-metal catalysis is a potentially powerful yet relatively underexplored strategy, with most investigations thus far focusing on using hydrogen bonds as the controlling element. We have developed an ion pair-directed approach to controlling regioselectivity in the iridium-catalyzed borylation of two classes of aromatic quaternary ammonium salts, leading to versatile meta-borylated products. By examining a range of substituted substrates, this provides complex, functionalized aromatic scaffolds amenable to rapid diversification and more broadly demonstrates the viability of ion-pairing for control of regiochemistry in transition-metal catalysis."
Addition of the carbon\xe2\x80\x93fluorine bond of a series of perfluorinated and polyfluorinated arenes across the Mg\xe2\x80\x93Mg bond of a simple coordination complex proceeds rapidly in solution. The reaction results in the formation of a new carbon\xe2\x80\x93magnesium bond and a new fluorine\xe2\x80\x93magnesium bond and is analogous to Grignard formation in homogeneous solution.
"The ability to direct the assembly of hexagonal building units offers great prospective to construct the awaited and looked-for hypothetical polybenzene (pbz) or \xe2\x80\x9ccubic graphite\xe2\x80\x9d structure, described 70 years ago. Here, we demonstrate the successful use of reticular chemistry as an appropriate strategy for the design and deliberate construction of a zirconium-based metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework (MOF) with the intricate pbz underlying net topology. The judicious selection of the perquisite hexagonal building units, six connected organic and inorganic building blocks, allowed the formation of the pbz-MOF-1, the first example of a Zr(IV)-based MOF with pbz topology. Prominently, pbz-MOF-1 is highly porous, with associated pore size and pore volume of 13 \xc3\x85 and 0.99 cm3 g\xe2\x80\x931, respectively, and offers high gravimetric and volumetric methane storage capacities (0.23 g g\xe2\x80\x931 and 210.4 cm3 (STP) cm\xe2\x80\x933 at 80 bar). Notably, the pbz-MOF-1 pore system permits the attainment of one of the highest CH4 adsorbed phase density enhancements at high pressures (0.15 and 0.21 g cm\xe2\x80\x933 at 35 and 65 bar, respectively) as compared to benchmark microporous MOFs."
"This communication describes a mild, amide-directed fluorination of benzylic, allylic, and unactivated C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds mediated by iron. Upon exposure to a catalytic amount of iron(II) triflate (Fe(OTf)2), N-fluoro-2-methylbenzamides undergo chemoselective fluorine transfer to provide the corresponding fluorides in high yield. The reaction demonstrates broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance without the use of any noble metal additives. Mechanistic and computational experiments suggest that the reaction proceeds through short-lived radical intermediates with F-transfer mediated directly by iron."
"The direct arylation of aliphatic aldehydes has been established via Pd-catalyzed sp3 C\xe2\x80\x93H bond functionalization in the presence of 3-aminopropanoic acids as transient directing groups. The reaction showed excellent functional group compatibility and chemoselectivity in which a predominant preference for functionalizing unactivated \xce\xb2-C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds of methyl groups over others was achieved. In addition, C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds of unactivated secondary sp3 carbons can also be functionalized. The extreme popularity and importance of aliphatic aldehydes would result in broad applications of this novel method in organic chemistry and medicinal sciences."
A combination of cobalt and nickel catalytic cycles enables a highly branch-selective (Markovnikov) olefin hydroarylation. Radical cyclization and ring scission experiments are consistent with hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) generation of a carbon-centered radical that leads to engagement of a nickel cycle.
"The synthesis of 11a,25a-dibora-11,12,25,26-tetraoxatetranaphtho[1,2-a:2\xe2\x80\xb2,1\xe2\x80\xb2-f:1\xe2\x80\xb3,2\xe2\x80\xb3-j:2\xe2\x80\xb4,1\xe2\x80\xb4-o]perylene, a double [7]heterohelicene containing OBO units, has been achieved via tandem demethylation-borylation, representing the highest double helicene reported thus far with all six-membered rings. Single-crystal X-ray analysis clearly demonstrated a significantly twisted structure with the terminal aromatic rings overlapping at both ends, giving the first example of a double helicene with intramolecular \xcf\x80-layers. Such structural features resulted in a high theoretical isomerization barrier of 45.1 kcal/mol, which is the highest value for all the double helicenes ever reported, rendering the achieved molecule with high chiral stability. The (P,P)- and (M,M)-isomers were separated by chiral HPLC and the chiroptical properties were investigated, revealing opposite circular dichroism responses."
"A stable bismabenzene was synthesized, isolated, and structurally characterized. The prospective aromaticity of this heavy benzene, bearing a sixth-row element, was examined by X-ray crystallography and NMR and UV\xe2\x80\x93vis spectroscopy, as well as theoretical DFT calculations. Structural analysis of this bismabenzene revealed a planar ring containing unsaturated Bi\xe2\x80\x93C and C\xe2\x80\x93C bonds. As bond alternations could not be observed, these results are consistent with the formal criteria of aromaticity. Theoretical calculations also support the aromatic nature of this bismabenzene, which reacted with an alkyne to form the corresponding [4+2] cycloadduct, thus demonstrating a small yet tangible aromatic stabilization energy."
"The synthesis and reactivity of a series of mononuclear nonheme iron complexes that carry out intramolecular aromatic C\xe2\x80\x93F hydroxylation reactions is reported. The key intermediate prior to C\xe2\x80\x93F hydroxylation, [FeIV(O)(N4Py2Ar1)](BF4)2 (1-O, Ar1 = \xe2\x88\x922,6-difluorophenyl), was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal structure revealed a nonbonding C\xe2\x80\x93H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O\xe2\x95\x90Fe interaction with a CH3CN molecule. Variable-field M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectroscopy of 1-O indicates an intermediate-spin (S = 1) ground state. The M\xc3\xb6ssbauer parameters for 1-O include an unusually small quadrupole splitting for a triplet FeIV(O) and are reproduced well by density functional theory calculations. With the aim of investigating the initial step for C\xe2\x80\x93F hydroxylation, two new ligands were synthesized, N4Py2Ar2 (L2, Ar2 = \xe2\x88\x922,6-difluoro-4-methoxyphenyl) and N4Py2Ar3 (L3, Ar3 = \xe2\x88\x922,6-difluoro-3-methoxyphenyl), with \xe2\x88\x92OMe substituents in the meta or ortho/para positions with respect to the C\xe2\x80\x93F bonds. FeII complexes [Fe(N4Py2Ar2)(CH3CN)](ClO4)2 (2) and [Fe(N4Py2Ar3)(CH3CN)](ClO4)2 (3) reacted with isopropyl 2-iodoxybenzoate to give the C\xe2\x80\x93F hydroxylated FeIII\xe2\x80\x93OAr products. The FeIV(O) intermediates 2-O and 3-O were trapped at low temperature and characterized. Complex 2-O displayed a C\xe2\x80\x93F hydroxylation rate similar to that of 1-O. In contrast, the kinetics (via stopped-flow UV\xe2\x80\x93vis) for complex 3-O displayed a significant rate enhancement for C\xe2\x80\x93F hydroxylation. Eyring analysis revealed the activation barriers for the C\xe2\x80\x93F hydroxylation reaction for the three complexes, consistent with the observed difference in reactivity. A terminal FeII(OH) complex (4) was prepared independently to investigate the possibility of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution pathway, but the stability of 4 rules out this mechanism. Taken together the data fully support an electrophilic C\xe2\x80\x93F hydroxylation mechanism."
"The development of facile methods for screening organic functional molecules through C\xe2\x80\x93H bond activation is a revolutionary trend in materials research. The prediction of mechanochromism as well as mechanochromic trends of luminogens is an appealing yet challenging puzzle. Here, we present a strategy for the design of mechanochromic luminogens based on the dipole moment of donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor  molecules. For this purpose, a highly efficient route to 2,7-diaryl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines (2,7-diaryl-TAPs) has been established through programmed C\xe2\x80\x93H arylation, which unlocks a great opportunity to rapidly assemble a library of fluorophores for the discovery of mechanochromic regularity. Molecular dipole moment can be employed to explain and further predict the mechanochromic trends. The 2,7-diaryl-TAPs with electron-donating groups on the 2-aryl and electron-withdrawing groups on the 7-aryl possess a relatively small dipole moment and exhibit a red-shifted mechanochromism. When the two aryls are interchanged, the resulting luminogens have a relatively large dipole moment and display a blue-shifted mechanochromism. Seven pairs of isomers with opposite mechanochromic trends are presented as illustrative examples. The aryl-interchanged congeners with a bidirectional emission shift are structurally similar, which provides an avenue for understanding in-depth the mechanochromic mechanism."
"This paper reports large bathochromic shifts of up to 260 meV in both the excitonic absorption and emission peaks of oleylamine (OLA)-passivated molecule-like (CdSe)34 nanocrystals caused by postsynthetic treatment with the electron accepting Cd(O2CPh)2 complex at room temperature. These shifts are found to be reversible upon removal of Cd(O2CPh)2 by N,N,N\xe2\x80\xb2,N\xe2\x80\xb2-tetramethylethylene-1,2-diamine. 1H NMR and FTIR characterizations of the nanocrystals demonstrate that the OLA remained attached to the surface of the nanocrystals during the reversible removal of Cd(O2CPh)2. On the basis of surface ligand characterization, X-ray powder diffraction measurements, and additional control experiments, we propose that these peak red shifts are a consequence of the delocalization of confined exciton wave functions into the interfacial electronic states that are formed from interaction of the LUMO of the nanocrystals and the LUMO of Cd(O2CPh)2, as opposed to originating from a change in size or reorganization of the inorganic core. Furthermore, attachment of Cd(O2CPh)2 to the OLA-passivated (CdSe)34 nanocrystal surface increases the photoluminescence quantum yield from 5% to an unprecedentedly high 70% and causes a 3-fold increase of the photoluminescence lifetime, which are attributed to a combination of passivation of nonradiative surface trap states and relaxation of exciton confinement. Taken together, our work demonstrates the unique aspects of surface ligand chemistry in controlling the excitonic absorption and emission properties of ultrasmall (CdSe)34 nanocrystals, which could expedite their potential applications in solid-state device fabrication."
"Suppressing the charge recombination (CR) that follows an efficient charge separation (CS) is of key importance for energy, electronics, and photonics applications. We focus on the role of dynamic gating for impeding CR in a molecular rotor, comprising an electron donor and acceptor directly linked via a single bond. The media viscosity has an unusual dual effect on the dynamics of CS and CR in this dyad. For solvents with intermediate viscosity, CR is 1.5\xe2\x80\x933 times slower than CS. Lowering the viscosity below \xe2\x88\xbc0.6 mPa s or increasing it above \xe2\x88\xbc10 mPa s makes CR 10\xe2\x80\x9330 times slower than CS. Ring rotation around the donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor bond can account only for the trends observed for nonviscous solvents. Media viscosity, however, affects not only torsional but also vibrational modes. Suppressing predominantly slow vibrational modes by viscous solvents can impact the rates of CS and CR to a different extent. That is, an increase in the viscosity can plausibly suppress modes that are involved in the transition from the charge-transfer (CT) to the ground state, i.e., CR, but at the same time are not important for the transition from the locally excited to the CT state, i.e., CS. These results provide a unique example of synergy between torsional and vibronic modes and their drastic effects on charge-transfer dynamics, thus setting paradigms for controlling CS and CR."
"Transport of biomolecules, drugs, and other reagents across the cell\xe2\x80\x99s plasma membrane barrier is an inefficient and poorly controlled process, despite its fundamental importance to biotechnology, cell biology, and pharmaceutics. In particular, insufficient membrane permeability frequently limits the accumulation of drugs and reagents in the cytoplasm, undermining their efficacy. While encapsulating drugs in particles increases uptake by cells, inefficient release of drugs from these particles into the cytoplasm ultimately limits drug efficacy. In contrast, gap junctions provide a direct route to the cytoplasm that bypasses the plasma membrane. As transmembrane channels that physically connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells, gap junctions permit transport of a diverse range of molecules, from ions and metabolites to siRNA, peptides, and chemotherapeutics. To utilize gap junctions for molecular delivery we have developed Connectosomes, cell-derived lipid vesicles that contain functional gap junction channels and encapsulate molecular cargos. Here we show that these vesicles form gap junction channels with cells, opening a direct and efficient route for the delivery of molecular cargo to the cellular cytoplasm. Specifically, we demonstrate that using gap junctions to deliver the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin reduces the therapeutically effective dose of the drug by more than an order of magnitude. Delivering drugs through gap junctions has the potential to boost the effectiveness of existing drugs such as chemotherapeutics, while simultaneously enabling the delivery of membrane-impermeable drugs and reagents."
"The immobilization of a copper calix[6]azacryptand funnel complex on gold-modified electrodes is reported. Two different methodologies are described. One is based on alkyne-terminated thiol self-assembled monolayers. The other relies on the electrografting of a calix[4]arene platform bearing diazonium functionalities at its large rim and carboxylic functions at its small rim, which is post-functionalized with alkyne moieties. In both cases, the CuAAC electroclick methodology proved to be the method of choice for grafting the calix[6]azacryptand onto the monolayers. The surface-immobilized complex was fully characterized by surface spectroscopies and electrochemistry in organic and aqueous solvents. The Cu complex displays a well-defined quasi-reversible system in cyclic voltammetry associated with the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox process. Remarkably, this redox process triggers a powerful selective detection of primary alkylamines in water at a micromolar level, based on a cavitary recognition process."
"Laser ablation generated RhAl3O4+ heteronuclear metal oxide cluster cations have been mass-selected using a quadrupole mass filter and reacted with CH4 or CD4 in a linear ion trap reactor under thermal collision conditions. The reactions have been characterized by state-of-the-art mass spectrometry and quantum chemistry calculations. The RhAl3O4+ cluster can activate four C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds of a methane molecule and convert methane to syngas, an important intermediate product in methane conversion to value-added chemicals. The Rh atom is the active site for activation of the C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds of methane. The high electron-withdrawing capability of Rh atom is the driving force to promote the conversion of methane to syngas. The polarity of Rh oxidation state is changed from positive to negative after the reaction. This study has provided the first example of methane conversion to syngas by heteronuclear metal oxide clusters under thermal collision conditions. Furthermore, the molecular level origin has been revealed for the condensed-phase experimental observation that trace amounts of Rh can promote the participation of lattice oxygen of chemically very inert support (Al2O3) to oxidize methane to carbon monoxide."
"Here, we compare analogous cyclic and acyclic \xcf\x80-conjugated molecules as n-type electronic materials and find that the cyclic molecules have numerous benefits in organic photovoltaics. This is the first report of such a direct comparison. We designed two conjugated cycles for this study. Each comprises four subunits: one combines four electron-accepting, redox-active, diphenyl-perylenediimide subunits, and the other alternates two electron-donating bithiophene units with two diphenyl-perylenediimide units. We compare the macrocycles to acyclic versions of these molecules and find that, relative to the acyclic analogs, the conjugated macrocycles have bathochromically shifted UV\xe2\x80\x93vis absorbances and are more easily reduced. In blended films, macrocycle-based devices show higher electron mobility and good morphology. All of these factors contribute to the more than doubling of the power conversion efficiency observed in organic photovoltaic devices with these macrocycles as the n-type, electron transporting material. This study highlights the importance of geometric design in creating new molecular semiconductors. The ease with which we can design and tune the electronic properties of these cyclic structures charts a clear path to creating a new family of cyclic, conjugated molecules as electron transporting materials in optoelectronic and electronic devices."
"Proteins are dynamic molecules that can transiently adopt different conformational states. As the function of the system often depends critically on its conformational state a rigorous understanding of the correlation between structure, energetics and dynamics of the different accessible states is crucial. The biophysical characterization of such processes is, however, challenging as the excited states are often only marginally populated. We show that a combination of X-ray crystallography performed at 100 K as well as at room temperature and EPR spectroscopy on a spin-labeled single crystal allows to correlate the structures of the ground state and a thermally excited state with their thermodynamics using the variant 118R1 of T4 lysozyme as an example. In addition, it is shown that the surrounding solvent can significantly alter the energetic as well as the entropic contribution to the Gibbs free energy without major impact on the structure of both states."
"Effective strategies for mimicking \xce\xb1-helix and \xce\xb2-strand epitopes have been developed, producing valuable inhibitors for some classes of protein\xe2\x80\x93protein interactions (PPIs). However, there are no general strategies for translating loop epitopes into useful PPI inhibitors. In this work, we use the LoopFinder program to identify diverse sets of \xe2\x80\x9chot loops,\xe2\x80\x9d which are loop epitopes that mediate PPIs. These include loops that are well-suited to mimicry with macrocyclic compounds, and loops that are most similar to variable loops on antibodies and ankyrin repeat proteins. We present data-driven criteria for scoring loop-mediated PPIs, uncovering a trove of potentially druggable interactions. We also use unbiased clustering to identify common structures among the hot loops. To translate these insights into real-world inhibitors, we describe a robust, diversity-oriented strategy for the rapid production and evaluation of cyclized loops. This method is applied to a computationally identified loop in the PPI between stonin2 and Eps15, producing submicromolar inhibitors. The most potent inhibitor is well-structured in water and successfully mimics the native epitope. Overall, these computational and experimental strategies provide new opportunities to design inhibitors for an otherwise intractable set of PPIs."
"Ion exchange, in which an in-diffusing ion replaces a lattice ion, has been widely exploited as a synthetic tool for semiconductor doping and solid-to-solid chemical transformations, both in bulk and at the nanoscale. Here, we present a systematic investigation of cation-exchange reactions that involve the displacement of Mn2+ from CdSe nanocrystals by Cd2+ or In3+. For both incoming cations, Mn2+ displacement is spontaneous but thermally activated, following Arrhenius behavior over a broad experimental temperature range. At any given temperature, cation exchange by In3+ is approximately 2 orders of magnitude faster than that by Cd2+, illustrating a critical dependence on the incoming cation. Quantitative analysis of the kinetics data within a Fick\xe2\x80\x99s-law diffusion model yields diffusion barriers (ED) and limiting diffusivities (D0) for both incoming ions. Despite their very different kinetics, indistinguishable diffusion barriers of ED \xe2\x89\x88 1.1 eV are found for both reactions (In3+ and Cd2+). A dramatically enhanced diffusivity is found for Mn2+ cation exchange by In3+. Overall, these findings provide unique experimental insights into cation diffusion within colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, contributing to our fundamental understanding of this rich and important area of nanoscience."
"Rechargeable aqueous Zn-ion batteries are attractive cheap, safe and green energy storage technologies but are bottlenecked by limitation in high-capacity cathode and compatible electrolyte to achieve satisfactory cyclability. Here we report the application of nonstoichiometric ZnMn2O4/carbon composite as a new Zn-insertion cathode material in aqueous Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte. In 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 solution that enables \xe2\x88\xbc100% Zn plating/stripping efficiency with long-term stability and suppresses Mn dissolution, the spinel/carbon hybrid exhibits a reversible capacity of 150 mAh g\xe2\x80\x931 and a capacity retention of 94% over 500 cycles at a high rate of 500 mA g\xe2\x80\x931. The remarkable electrode performance results from the facile charge transfer and Zn insertion in the structurally robust spinel featuring small particle size and abundant cation vacancies, as evidenced by combined electrochemical measurements, XRD, Raman, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, FTIR, and NMR analysis. The results would enlighten and promote the use of cation-defective spinel compounds and trifluoromethanesulfonic electrolyte to develop high-performance rechargeable zinc batteries."
"Hydrogen bonds are among the most common interactions used by nature for the creation of hierarchical structures from smaller building blocks. Herein, we describe an in-depth study of the hierarchical assembly of cylindrical block comicelles with a crystallizable poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) (PFS) core via H-bonding interactions to form complex supermicellar structures. Well-defined block comicelles bearing H-bond donor (HD) segments (M(PFS-b-PMVSOH)), or H-bond acceptor (HA) segments (M(PFS-b-P2VP)), and non-interacting (N) segments (M(PFS-b-PtBA)) were created by the living crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) method [PMVSOH = hydroxyl-functionalized poly(methylvinylsiloxane), P2VP = poly(2-vinylpyridine), PtBA = poly(tert-butyl acrylate), M = micelle segment]. Due to the control provided by the living CDSA approach, both the block comicelles and the individual segments were virtually monodisperse in length, which facilitated their predictable hierarchical assembly into higher-level structures. Two cases were investigated in detail: first, the interaction of N-HA-N triblock comicelles with the HD homopolymer PMVSOH, and second, the interaction of N-HD-N triblock comicelles with very short HA cylinders (seeds). By manipulation of several factors, namely coronal steric effects (via the PtBA corona chain) and attractive interaction strength (via the H-bonding interaction between P2VP and PMVSOH), the aggregation of the triblock comicelles could be controlled, and well-defined multi-micrometer-size structures such as \xe2\x80\x9cshish-kebab\xe2\x80\x9d-shaped supermicelles were prepared. The ability of the seeds adsorbed on the block comicelles to function as initiators for living CDSA to generate fence-like \xe2\x80\x9cshish-kebab\xe2\x80\x9d superstructures was also explored."
"Heteronanostructures have attracted intensive attention due to their electronic coupling effects between distinct components. Despite tremendous advances of nanostructure fabrication, combining independent polymorphs by forming heterojunction is still challenging but fascinating, such as copper sulfides (Cu2\xe2\x80\x93xS), exhibiting varying band gaps and crystal structures with various stoichiometries. Herein, self-coupled Cu2\xe2\x80\x93xS polymorphs (Cu1.94S-CuS) by a facile one-pot chemical transformation route have been reported for the first time. Unprecedentedly, a manganous precursor plays a crucial role in inducing and directing the formation of such a dumbbell-like architecture, which combines 1D Cu1.94S with 2D CuS. During the transformation, Mn2+ ions mediate the Cu+ ions diffusion and phase conversion process particularly. Furthermore, this self-coupled polymorphic structure exhibits significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical properties compared with the individual Cu1.94S nanocrystals and CuS nanoplates, originating from the unique heterointerfaces constructed by intrinsic band alignment and the enhanced contact between high conductivity hexagonal planes and the working electrode revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. So we anticipate this emerging interfacial charge separation could provide useful hints for applications in optoelectronic devices or photocatalysis."
"Synthetic analogues and computationally assisted structure\xe2\x80\x93function analyses have been used to explore the features that control proton\xe2\x80\x93electron and proton\xe2\x80\x93hydride coupling in electrocatalysts inspired by the [NiFe]-hydrogenase active site. Of the bimetallic complexes derived from aggregation of the dithiolato complexes MN2S2 (N2S2 = bismercaptoethane diazacycloheptane; M = Ni or Fe(NO)) with (\xce\xb75-C5H5)Fe(CO)+ (the Fe\xe2\x80\xb2 component) or (\xce\xb75-C5H5)Fe(CO)2+, Fe\xe2\x80\xb3, which yielded Ni\xe2\x80\x93Fe\xe2\x80\xb2+, Fe\xe2\x80\x93Fe\xe2\x80\xb2+, Ni\xe2\x80\x93Fe\xe2\x80\xb3+, and Fe\xe2\x80\x93Fe\xe2\x80\xb3+, respectively, both Ni\xe2\x80\x93Fe\xe2\x80\xb2+ and Fe\xe2\x80\x93Fe\xe2\x80\xb2+ were determined to be active electrocatalysts for H2 production in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. Correlations of electrochemical potentials and H2 generation are consistent with calculated parameters in a predicted mechanism that delineates the order of addition of electrons and protons, the role of the redox-active, noninnocent NO ligand in electron uptake, the necessity for Fe\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\x93S bond breaking (or the hemilability of the metallodithiolate ligand), and hydride-proton coupling routes. Although the redox active {Fe(NO)}7 moiety can accept and store an electron and subsequently a proton (forming the relatively unstable Fe-bound HNO), it cannot form a hydride as the NO shields the Fe from protonation. Successful coupling occurs from a hydride on Fe\xe2\x80\xb2 with a proton on thiolate S and requires a propitious orientation of the H\xe2\x80\x93S bond that places H+ and H\xe2\x80\x93 within coupling distance. This orientation and coupling barrier are redox-level dependent. While the Ni\xe2\x80\x93Fe\xe2\x80\xb2 derivative has vacant sites on both metals for hydride formation, the uptake of the required electron is more energy intensive than that in Fe\xe2\x80\x93Fe\xe2\x80\xb2 featuring the noninnocent NO ligand. The Fe\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\x93S bond cleavage facilitated by the hemilability of thiolate to produce a terminal thiolate as a proton shuttle is a key feature in both mechanisms. The analogous Fe\xe2\x80\xb3\xe2\x80\x93S bond cleavage on Ni\xe2\x80\x93Fe\xe2\x80\xb3 leads to degradation."
"Nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are experiencing a dramatic resurgence in recent years given their ability to employ a wider range of electrophiles as well as promote stereospecific or stereoselective transformations. In contrast to the extensively studied Pd catalysts that generally employ diamagnetic intermediates, Ni systems can more easily access various oxidation states including odd-electron configurations. For example, organometallic NiIII intermediates with aryl and/or alkyl ligands are commonly proposed as the active intermediates in cross-coupling reactions. Herein, we report the first isolated NiIII\xe2\x80\x93dialkyl complex and show that this species is involved in stoichiometric and catalytic C\xe2\x80\x93C bond formation reactions. Interestingly, the rate of C\xe2\x80\x93C bond formation from a NiIII center is enhanced in the presence of an oxidant, suggesting the involvement of transient NiIV species. Indeed, such a NiIV species was observed and characterized spectroscopically for a nickelacycle system. Overall, these studies suggest that both NiIII and NiIV species could play an important role in a range of Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, especially those involving alkyl substrates."
"Extensive chlorination of \xce\xb3-Al2O3 results in the formation of highly Lewis acidic surface domains depleted in surface hydroxyl groups. Adsorption of methyltrioxorhenium (MTO) onto these chlorinated domains serves to activate it as a low temperature, heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalyst and confers both high activity and high stability. Characterization of the catalyst reveals that the immobilized MTO undergoes partial ligand exchange with the surface, whereby some Re sites acquire a chloride ligand from the modified alumina while donating an oxo ligand to the support. More specifically, Re LIII-edge EXAFS and DFT calculations support facile ligand exchange between MTO and Cl\xe2\x80\x93Al2O3 to generate [CH3ReO2Cl+] fragments that interact with a bridging oxygen of the support via a Lewis acid\xe2\x80\x93base interaction. According to IR and solid-state NMR, the methyl group remains intact, and does not evolve spontaneously to a stable methylene tautomer. Nevertheless, the chloride-promoted metathesis catalyst is far more active and productive than MTO/\xce\xb3-Al2O3, easily achieving a TON of 100\xe2\x80\xaf000 for propene metathesis in a flow reactor at 10 \xc2\xb0C (compared to TON < 5000 for the nonchlorinated catalyst). Increased activity is a consequence of both a larger fraction of active sites and a higher intrinsic activity for the new sites. Increased stability is tentatively attributed to a stronger interaction between MTO and chlorinated surface regions, as well as extensive depletion of the Br\xc3\xb8nsted acidic surface hydroxyl population. The reformulated catalyst represents a major advance for Re-based metathesis catalysts, whose widespread use has thus far been severely hampered by their instability."
"Fidelity of translation, which is predominately dictated by the accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in pairing amino acids with correct tRNAs, is of central importance in biology. Yet, deliberate modifications of translational fidelity can be beneficial. Here we found human and not E.\xc2\xa0coli AlaRS has an intrinsic capacity for mispairing alanine onto nonalanyl-tRNAs including tRNACys. Consistently, a cysteine-to-alanine substitution was found in a reporter protein expressed in human cells. All human AlaRS-mischarged tRNAs have a G4:U69 base pair in the acceptor stem. The base pair is required for the mischarging. By solving the crystal structure of human AlaRS and comparing it to that of E.\xc2\xa0coli AlaRS, we identified a key sequence divergence between eukaryotes and bacteria that influences mischarging. Thus, the expanded tRNA specificity of AlaRS appears to be an evolutionary gain-of-function to provide posttranscriptional alanine substitutions in eukaryotic proteins for potential regulations."
"Inspired by the zwitterion species generated from the splitting of H2 by frustrated Lewis pairs, we put forward a novel frustrated Lewis pair by the combination of H\xce\xb4- and H\xce\xb4+ incorporated Lewis acid and base together. Piers\xe2\x80\x99 borane and chiral tert-butylsulfinamide were chosen as the FLP, and a metal-free asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of imines was realized with high enantioselectivities. Significantly, with ammonia borane as hydrogen source, a catalytic asymmetric reaction using 10 mol % of Piers\xe2\x80\x99 borane, chiral tert-butylsulfinamide, and pyridine additive, has been successfully achieved to furnish optically active amines in 78\xe2\x80\x9399% yields with 84\xe2\x80\x9395% ee\xe2\x80\x99s. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies reveal an interesting 8-membered ring hydrogen transfer transition state and an expected regeneration of reactive species with ammonia borane. Accordingly, a plausible catalytic pathway for this reaction is depicted."
"The electronic features of Zn(II) and Ru(II) phthalocyanines (Pcs) have been modulated by direct peripheral attachment of up to eight ferrocenes. The presence of peripheral ferrocenes noticeably impacts the electronic properties of the corresponding ZnPc and RuPc complexes 7, 12 and 9, 15, respectively\xe2\x80\x94a notion that is supported by optical spectroscopy with bathochromic shifts of up to 8\xe2\x80\x9310 nm per ferrocene unit. Cyclic voltammetry and optical spectroscopy reveal long-distance (10\xe2\x80\x9311 bonds) electronic interaction between ferrocene units. The ZnPc and RuPc complexes have been integrated into a series of orthogonal, supramolecular bis(phthalocyanine)\xe2\x80\x93perylenediimide electron donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor conjugates, 2a,b and 3a,b. In these cart-wheel-shaped arrays, coordination of ditopic perylenediimide 16, containing two pyridyl substituents at its imido positions, enabled selective interactions with the metal centers of phthalocyanines 7, 12, 9, and 15. The presence of ferrocenes in, for example, Zn complexes 2a and 3a triggers a fast energy transfer from the excited-state PDI to ZnPc. In the RuPc-PDI conjugates, substitution with ferrocenes produces a slight acceleration of the charge separation upon photoexcitation of the PDI chromophore. However, charge recombination is accelerated by 2 orders of magnitude in ferrocene-containing conjugates when compared to that in the analogous tert-butyl-substituted array 1b."
"A stereocontrolled first total synthesis of muraymycin D1 (1) has been achieved. The synthetic route is highly stereoselective, featuring (1) selective \xce\xb2-ribosylation of the C2-methylated amino ribose, (2) selective Strecker reaction, and (3) ring-opening reaction of a diastereomeric mixture of a diaminolactone to synthesize muraymycidine (epi-capreomycidine). The acid-cleavable protecting groups for secondary alcohol and uridine ureido nitrogen are applied for simultaneous deprotections with the Boc and tBu groups. Muraymycin D1 (1) and its amide derivatives (2 and 3) exhibited growth inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC50 = 1.56\xe2\x80\x936.25 \xce\xbcg/mL) and strong enzyme inhibitory activities against the bacterial phosphotransferases (MurX and WecA) (IC50 = 0.096\xe2\x80\x930.69 \xce\xbcM)."
"Ceramide is a pro-apoptotic sphingolipid with unique physical characteristics. Often viewed as a second messenger, its generation can modulate the structure of lipid rafts. We prepared three photoswitchable ceramides, ACes, which contain an azobenzene photoswitch allowing for optical control over the N-acyl chain. Using combined atomic force and confocal fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that the ACes enable reversible switching of lipid domains in raft-mimicking supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). In the trans-configuration, the ACes localize into the liquid-ordered (Lo) phase. Photoisomerization to the cis-form triggers a fluidification of the Lo domains, as liquid-disordered (Ld) \xe2\x80\x9clakes\xe2\x80\x9d are formed within the rafts. Photoisomerization back to the trans-state with blue light stimulates a rigidification inside the Ld phase, as the formation of small Lo domains. These changes can be repeated over multiple cycles, enabling a dynamic spatiotemporal control of the lipid raft structure with light."
"Terminal high-valent metal\xe2\x80\x93oxygen species are key reaction intermediates in the catalytic cycle of both enzymes (e.g., oxygenases) and synthetic oxidation catalysts. While tremendous efforts have been directed toward the characterization of the biologically relevant terminal manganese\xe2\x80\x93oxygen and iron\xe2\x80\x93oxygen species, the corresponding analogues based on late-transition metals such as cobalt, nickel or copper are relatively scarce. This scarcity is in part related to the \xe2\x80\x9cOxo Wall\xe2\x80\x9d concept, which predicts that late transition metals cannot support a terminal oxido ligand in a tetragonal environment. Here, the nickel(II) complex (1) of the tetradentate macrocyclic ligand bearing a 2,6-pyridinedicarboxamidate unit is shown to be an effective catalyst in the chlorination and oxidation of C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds with sodium hypochlorite as terminal oxidant in the presence of acetic acid (AcOH). Insight into the active species responsible for the observed reactivity was gained through the study of the reaction of 1 with ClO\xe2\x80\x93 at low temperature by UV\xe2\x80\x93vis absorption, resonance Raman, EPR, ESI-MS, and XAS analyses. DFT calculations aided the assignment of the trapped chromophoric species (3) as a nickel-hypochlorite species. Despite the fact that the formal oxidation state of the nickel in 3 is +4, experimental and computational analysis indicate that 3 is best formulated as a NiIII complex with one unpaired electron delocalized in the ligands surrounding the metal center. Most remarkably, 3 reacts rapidly with a range of substrates including those with strong aliphatic C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds, indicating the direct involvement of 3 in the oxidation/chlorination reactions observed in the 1/ClO\xe2\x80\x93/AcOH catalytic system."
"Investigating and deciphering the dynamics of photoswitchable foldamers provides a detailed understanding of their photoinduced conformational transitions, resembling similar processes in photoresponsive biomacromolecules. We studied the ultrafast dynamics of the photoisomerization of azobenzene moieties embedded in a foldamer backbone and the resulting conformational helix\xe2\x80\x93coil transition by time-resolved femtosecond/picosecond pump\xe2\x80\x93probe spectroscopy in the visible and infrared region. During E \xe2\x86\x92 Z photoisomerization of the azobenzenes, the complexity of the photoinduced conformational transition of the pentameric foldamer 105 is reflected in distinct spectral characteristics and a 2-fold slower decay of the excited-state absorption bands compared to the monomer M (\xcf\x844,foldamer = 20 ps, \xcf\x844,monomer = 9 ps). Time-resolved IR experiments reveal the vibrational features of the monomer and the foldamer after photoexcitation, with an additional time constant for the foldamer (\xcf\x84 = 150 ps), indicating the initial steps of unfolding of the helical conformation, which are supported by density functional theory calculations. Our results record the overall sequence of photoinduced structural changes in the foldamer, starting from the initial ultrafast isomerization of the azobenzene unit(s) and ending with the complete unfolding on a later time scale. From our experiments, we could gain insight into the coupling of primary photoisomerization events (\xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d) and secondary unfolding processes (\xe2\x80\x9ceffect\xe2\x80\x9d) in these oligoazobenzene foldamers."
"Electrolyte cation size is known to influence the electrochemical reduction of CO2 over metals; however, a satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon has not been developed. We report here that these effects can be attributed to a previously unrecognized consequence of cation hydrolysis occurring in the vicinity of the cathode. With increasing cation size, the pKa for cation hydrolysis decreases and is sufficiently low for hydrated K+, Rb+, and Cs+ to serve as buffering agents. Buffering lowers the pH near the cathode, leading to an increase in the local concentration of dissolved CO2. The consequences of these changes are an increase in cathode activity, a decrease in Faradaic efficiencies for H2 and CH4, and an increase in Faradaic efficiencies for CO, C2H4, and C2H5OH, in full agreement with experimental observations for CO2 reduction over Ag and Cu."
"[NiFe] hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible oxidation of H2. While electron transfer to and from the active site is understood to occur through iron\xe2\x80\x93sulfur clusters, the mechanism of proton transfer is still debated. Two mechanisms for proton exchange with the active site have been proposed that involve distinct and conserved ionizable amino acid residues, one a glutamate, and the other an arginine. To examine the potential role of the conserved glutamate on active site acid\xe2\x80\x93base chemistry, we mutated the putative proton donor E17 to Q in the soluble hydrogenase I from Pyrococcus furiosus using site directed mutagenesis. FTIR spectroscopy, sensitive to the CO and CN ligands of the active site, reveals catalytically active species generated upon reduction with H2, including absorption features consistent with the Nia-C intermediate. Time-resolved IR spectroscopy, which probes active site dynamics after hydride photolysis from Nia-C, indicates the E17Q mutation does not interfere with the hydride photolysis process generating known intermediates Nia-I1 and Nia-I2. Strikingly, the E17Q mutation disrupts obligatory proton-coupled electron transfer from the Nia-I1 state, thereby preventing formation of Nia-S. These results directly establish E17 as a proton donor/acceptor in the Nia-S \xe2\x86\x94 Nia-C equilibrium."
"Cucurbit[n]urils (CBn, n = 7, 8) serve as artificial receptors for steroids (21 tested), including the hormones testosterone and estradiol as well as steroidal drugs. Fluorescence displacement titrations and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) provided up to nanomolar binding affinities in aqueous solution for these hydrophobic target molecules, exceeding the values of known synthetic receptors. Remarkable binding selectivities, even for homologous steroid pairs, were investigated in detail by NMR, X-ray crystal diffraction, ITC, and quantum chemical calculations. Notably, the CBn\xe2\x80\xa2steroid complexes are stable in water and buffers, in artificial gastric acid, and even in blood serum. Numerous applications have been demonstrated, which range from the solubility enhancement of the steroids in the presence of the macrocycles (up to 100 times, for drug delivery) and the principal component analysis of the fluorescence responses of different CBn\xe2\x80\xa2reporter dye combinations (for differential sensing of steroids) to the real-time monitoring of chemical conversions of steroids as substrates (for enzyme assays)."
"A non-isolated pentagon rule metallic carbide clusterfullerene containing a heptagonal ring, Sc2C2@Cs(hept)-C88, was isolated from the raw soot obtained by electric arc vaporization of graphite rods packed with Sc2O3 and graphite powder under a helium atmosphere. The Sc2C2@Cs(hept)-C88 was purified by multistage high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), cocrystallized with Ni\xe2\x80\x93(octaethylporphyrin), and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The diffraction data revealed a zigzag Sc2C2 unit inside an unprecedented Cs(hept)-C88 carbon cage containing 13 pentagons, 32 hexagons, and 1 heptagon. Calculations suggest that the observed nonclassical fullerene could be a kinetically trapped species derived from the recently reported Sc2C2@C2v(9)-C86 via a direct C2 insertion."
"The homotetrameric M2 proton channel of influenza A plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle and is thus an important therapeutic target. It selectively conducts protons against a background of other competing cations whose concentrations are up to a million times greater than the proton concentration. Its selectivity is largely determined by a constricted region of its open pore known as the selectivity filter, which is lined by four absolutely conserved histidines. While the mechanism of proton transport through the channel has been studied, the physical principles underlying the selectivity for protons over other cations in the channel\xe2\x80\x99s His4 selectivity filter remain elusive. Furthermore, it is not known if proton selectivity absolutely requires all four histidines with two of the four histidines protonated and if other titratable amino acid residues in lieu of the histidines could bind protons and how they affect proton selectivity. Here, we elucidate how the competition between protons and rival cations such as Na+ depends on the selectivity filter\xe2\x80\x99s (1) histidine protonation state, (2) solvent exposure, (3) oligomeric state (the number of protein chains and thus the number of His ligands), and (4) ligand composition by evaluating the free energies for replacing monovalent Na+ with H3O+ in various model selectivity filters. We show that tetrameric His4 filters are more proton-selective than their trimeric His3 counterparts, and a dicationic His4 filter where two of the four histidines are protonated is more proton-selective than tetrameric filters with other charge states/composition (different combinations of His protonation states or different metal-ligating ligands). The [His4]2+ filter achieves proton selectivity by providing suboptimal binding conditions for rival cations such as Na+, which prefers a neutral or negatively charged filter instead of a dicationic one, and three rather than four ligands with oxygen-ligating atoms."
"Organic radicals display unique physical structures and could become next generation functional materials. However, design and synthesis of stable neutral radicals with a significant polyradical character has been an enormous challenge for chemists. In this work, we synthesized a series of stable 3,6-linked, kinetically blocked fluorenyl radical oligomers up to hexamer (FR-n, n = 1\xe2\x80\x936). Their ground-state geometric and electronic structures were systematically studied by various experimental methods including X-ray crystallographic analysis, variable temperature nuclear magnetic resonance, electron spin resonance, and superconducting quantum interference device measurements, supported by density functional theory and ab initio calculations. Moderate antiferromagnetic coupling between the fluorenyl radicals was observed, and moderate to large diradical and polyradical characters were calculated from dimer onward. Furthermore, their photophysical properties were estimated by steady-state, transient absorption, and two-photon absorption measurements, and their electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry/differential pulse voltammetry and spectro-electrochemical measurements. A clear chain length dependence of their optical, electrochemical, and magnetic properties was found for the oligomers with an odd or even number of spin centers, respectively."
"An integrated methodology is described to establish ligand requirements for heparan sulfate (HS) binding proteins based on a workflow in which HS octasaccharides are produced by partial enzymatic degradation of natural HS followed by size exclusion purification, affinity enrichment using an immobilized HS-binding protein of interest, putative structure determination of isolated compounds by a hydrophilic interaction chromatography\xe2\x80\x93high-resolution mass spectrometry platform, and chemical synthesis of well-defined HS oligosaccharides for structure\xe2\x80\x93activity relationship studies. The methodology was used to establish the ligand requirements of human Roundabout receptor 1 (Robo1), which is involved in a number of developmental processes. Mass spectrometric analysis of the starting octasaccharide mixture and the Robo1-bound fraction indicated that Robo1 has a preference for a specific set of structures. Further analysis was performed by sequential permethylation, desulfation, and pertrideuteroacetylation followed by online separation and structural analysis by MS/MS. Sequences of tetrasaccharides could be deduced from the data, and by combining the compositional and sequence data, a putative octasaccharide ligand could be proposed (GlA-GlcNS6S-IdoA-GlcNS-IdoA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoA-GlcNAc6S). A modular synthetic approach was employed to prepare the target compound, and binding studies by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) confirmed it to be a high affinity ligand for Robo1. Further studies with a number of tetrasaccharides confirmed that sulfate esters at C-6 are critical for binding, whereas such functionalities at C-2 substantially reduce binding. High affinity ligands were able to reverse a reduction in endothelial cell migration induced by Slit2-Robo1 signaling."
"Understanding the basis of electronic transport and developing ideas to improve thermoelectric power factor are essential for production of efficient thermoelectric materials. Here, we report a significantly large thermoelectric power factor of \xe2\x88\xbc31.4 \xce\xbcW/cm\xc2\xb7K2 at 856 K in Ag and In co-doped SnTe (i.e., SnAgxInxTe1+2x). This is the highest power factor so far reported for SnTe-based material, which arises from the synergistic effects of Ag and In on the electronic structure and the improved electrical transport properties of SnTe. In and Ag play different but complementary roles in modifying the valence band structure of SnTe. In-doping introduces resonance levels inside the valence bands, leading to a significant improvement in the Seebeck coefficient at room temperature. On the other hand, Ag-doping reduces the energy separation between light- and heavy-hole valence bands by widening the principal band gap, which also results in an improved Seebeck coefficient. Additionally, Ag-doping in SnTe enhances the p-type carrier mobility. Co-doping of In and Ag in SnTe yields synergistically enhanced Seebeck coefficient and power factor over a broad temperature range because of the synergy of the introduction of resonance states and convergence of valence bands, which have been confirmed by first-principles density functional theory-based electronic structure calculations. As a consequence, we have achieved an improved thermoelectric figure of merit, zT \xe2\x89\x88 1, in SnAg0.025In0.025Te1.05 at 856 K."
"A palladium(II)-catalyzed regioselective syn-hydroarylation reaction of homopropargyl amines has been developed, wherein selectivity is controlled by a cleavable bidentate directing group. Under the optimized reaction conditions, both dialkyl and alkylaryl alkyne substrates were found to undergo hydroarylation with high selectivity. The products of this reaction contain a 4,4-disubstituted homoallylic amine motif that is commonly seen in drug molecules and other bioactive compounds."
Molecular dynamics simulations express the relationship between a chaperone and histone proteins.
"The dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cell (DSPEC) integrates high bandgap, nanoparticle oxide semiconductors with the light-absorbing and catalytic properties of designed chromophore\xe2\x80\x93catalyst assemblies. The goals are photoelectrochemical water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen and reduction of CO2 by water to give oxygen and carbon-based fuels. Solar-driven water oxidation occurs at a photoanode and water or CO2 reduction at a cathode or photocathode initiated by molecular-level light absorption. Light absorption is followed by electron or hole injection, catalyst activation, and catalytic water oxidation or water/CO2 reduction. The DSPEC is of recent origin but significant progress has been made. It has the potential to play an important role in our energy future."
"Here we report an iridium-catalyzed asymmetric umpolung allylation of imines as a general approach to prepare 1,4-disubstituted homoallylic amines, a fundamental class of compounds that are hitherto not straightforward to obtain. This transformation proceeds by a cascade involving an intermolecular regioselective allylation of 2-azaallyl anions and a following 2-aza-Cope rearrangement, utilizes easily available reagents and catalysts, tolerates a substantial scope of substrates, and readily leads to various enantioenriched, 1,4-disubstituted homoallylic primary amines."
"During bacterial denitrification, two-electron reduction of N2O occurs at a [Cu4(\xce\xbc4-S)] catalytic site (CuZ*) embedded within the nitrous oxide reductase (N2OR) enzyme. In this Communication, an amidinate-supported [Cu4(\xce\xbc4-S)] model cluster in its one-hole (S = 1/2) redox state is thoroughly characterized. Along with its two-hole redox partner and fully reduced clusters reported previously, the new species completes the two-electron redox series of [Cu4(\xce\xbc4-S)] model complexes with catalytically relevant oxidation states for the first time. More importantly, N2O is reduced by the one-hole cluster to produce N2 and the two-hole cluster, thereby completing a closed cycle for N2O reduction. Not only is the title complex thus the best structural model for CuZ* to date, but it also serves as a functional CuZ* mimic."
"Diazocines, bridged azobenzenes, exhibit superior photophysical properties compared to parent azobenzenes such as high switching efficiencies, quantum yields, and particularly switching wavelengths in the visible range. Synthesis, however, proceeds with low yields, and derivatives are difficult to prepare. We now present two heterodiazocines which are easier to synthesize, and the general procedures should also provide facile access to derivatives. Moreover, both compounds can be switched with light in the far-red (650 nm). Accessibility and photophysical properties make them ideal candidates for applications such as photoswitchable drugs and functional materials."
"Titanium and zirconium complexes carrying two 2,6-bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine ligands have been synthesized and characterized. The neutral complexes Ti(MePDP)2 and Zr(MePDP)2 (MePDP = 2,6-bis(5-methyl-3-phenyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyridine) show intense ligand-to-metal charge-transfer bands in the visible region and undergo multiple reversible redox events under highly reducing conditions. Zr(MePDP)2 exhibits photoluminescent behavior and its excited state can be quenched by mild reductants to generate a powerful electron transfer reagent with a ground state potential of \xe2\x88\x922.16 V vs Fc+/0. This reactivity was utilized to facilitate dehalogenation reactions, the reduction of electron-poor olefins, and the reductive coupling of benzyl bromide via photoredox catalysis. In these reactions, the earth-abundant metal complex Zr(MePDP)2 acts as a substitute for the precious metal photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)3]2+."
"The first catalytic use of Ga(0) in organic synthesis has been developed by using a Ag(I) cocatalyst, crownether ligation, and ultrasonic activation. Ga(I)-catalyzed C\xe2\x80\x93C bond formations between allyl or allenyl boronic esters and acetals, ketals, or aminals have proceeded in high yields with essentially complete regio- and chemoselectivity. NMR spectroscopic analyses have revealed novel transient Ga(I) catalytic species, formed in situ through partial oxidation of Ga(0) and B\xe2\x80\x93Ga transmetalation, respectively. The possibility of asymmetric Ga(I) catalysis has been demonstrated."
"Identifying the protein targets of bioactive small molecules remains a major problem in the discovery of new chemical probes and therapeutics. While activity-based probes and photo-cross-linkers have had success in identifying protein targets of small molecules, each technique has limitations. Here we describe a method for direct proximity tagging of proteins that bind small molecules. We engineered a promiscuous ligase based on the NEDD8 conjugating enzyme, Ubc12, which can be covalently linked to a small molecule of interest. When target proteins bind the small molecule, they are directly labeled on surface lysines with a biotinylated derivative of the small ubiquitin homologue, NEDD8. This unique covalent tag can then be used to identify the small molecule binding proteins. Utilizing the drug dasatinib, we have shown that dasatinib-directed NEDDylation occurs for known endogenous protein binders in complex cell lysates. In addition, we have been able to improve NEDDylation efficiency through rational mutagenesis. Finally, we have shown that affinity-directed NEDDylation can be applied to two other protein\xe2\x80\x93ligand interactions beyond kinases. Proximity tagging using this engineered ligase requires direct binding of the target and, thus, provides a useful and orthogonal approach to facilitate small molecule target identification."
"Copper-doped semiconductors are designed to photoassist the alkyne\xe2\x80\x93azide cycloaddition catalysis by Cu(I). Upon irradiation, injection of electrons from the semiconductor into copper oxide nanostructures produces the catalytic Cu(I) species. The new catalysts are air- and moisture-tolerant and can be readily recovered after use and reused several times."
"Herein, we describe the selective formation of a discrete fused metallarhomboid and a triangle by the careful control of the shape and stoichiometry of the building blocks. A tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-based tetrapyridyl donor is exploited as the bridging component, and coordination immobilization of the TPE unit within the rigid metallacyclic frameworks efficiently suppresses its intramolecular rotational motions. As a result, the fused polygons are innately emissive in dilute solution, representing an alternative to aggregation-induced emission. Upon further molecular aggregation, these metallacycles display aggregation-induced enhanced emissions. Interestingly, the fused rhomboid 7 shows a weaker fluorescence in dilute solutions relative to that of the fused triangle 8, while a reversal of emission intensities was observed in the aggregated state. These markedly different fluorescence efficiencies are likely due to the differences in the shapes of the fused polygons. Thus, this work shows that the properties of supramolecular coordination complexes can be affected by subtle structural factors, which can be controlled easily and precisely at the molecular level."
"A highly efficient, two-step, one-pot synthetic strategy for amides and peptides was developed by employing ynamides as novel coupling reagents under extremely mild reaction conditions. The ynamides not only are effective for simple amide and dipeptide synthesis but can also be used for peptide segment condensation. Importantly, no racemization was detected during the activation of chiral carboxylic acids. Excellent amidation selectivity toward amino groups in the presence of \xe2\x88\x92OH, \xe2\x88\x92SH, \xe2\x88\x92CONH2, ArNH2, and the NH of indole was observed, making the protection of these functional groups unnecessary in amide and peptide synthesis."
"There are four well-known levels of protein structure: primary (amino acid sequence), secondary (helices, sheets and turns), tertiary (three-dimensional structure) and quaternary (specific protein\xe2\x80\x93protein interactions). The fifth level remains largely undefined because characterization of quinary structure, the transient but essential macromolecular interactions that organize the crowded cellular interior, requires the measurement of equilibrium thermodynamic parameters in living cells. We have overcome this challenge by quantifying the pH-dependence of quinary interactions in living Escherichia coli cells using the B1 domain of protein G (GB1, 6.2 kDa). To accomplish this goal, we buffered the cellular interior and used NMR-detected amide proton exchange to quantify the free energy of unfolding in cells. At neutral pH, the unfolding free energy in cells is comparable to that in buffered solution. As the pH decreases, the increased number of attractive interactions between E. coli proteins and GB1 destabilizes the protein in cells relative to buffer alone. The data show that electrostatic interactions contribute to quinary structure."
"High-valent Fe-OH species are often invoked as key intermediates but have only been observed in Compound II of cytochrome P450s. To further address the properties of non-heme FeIV-OH complexes, we demonstrate the reversible protonation of a synthetic FeIV-oxo species containing a tris-urea tripodal ligand. The same protonated FeIV-oxo species can be prepared via oxidation, suggesting that a putative FeV-oxo species was initially generated. Computational, M\xc3\xb6ssbauer, XAS, and NRVS studies indicate that protonation of the FeIV-oxo complex most likely occurs on the tripodal ligand, which undergoes a structural change that results in the formation of a new intramolecular H-bond with the oxido ligand that aids in stabilizing the protonated adduct. We suggest that similar protonated high-valent Fe-oxo species may occur in the active sites of proteins. This finding further argues for caution when assigning unverified high-valent Fe-OH species to mechanisms."
"An unexpected metal-free C\xe2\x89\xa1C triple bond cleavage, dioxygen activation, and reassembly into tryptophol derivatives has been developed. This chemistry provides a novel, simple, and efficient approach to highly valuable tryptophol derivatives from simple substrates under mild conditions. The mechanistic studies may promote the discovery of new methodologies through C\xe2\x80\x93C bond cleavage and dioxygen activation."
"A highly diastereoselective and enantioselective Cu(II)/SaBOX-catalyzed [2 + 2] cycloaddition of methylidenemalonate and multisubstituted alkenes was developed to furnish optically active cyclobutanes in high yields with >99/1 dr and up to >99% ee. By application of the newly developed method, the total synthesis of (+)-piperarborenine B was completed in eight steps from methylidenemalonate and olefin in 17% overall yield with >99/1 dr and 99% ee."
"Highly uniform single crystal ultrathin CsPbBr3 nanowires (NWs) with diameter of 2.2 \xc2\xb1 0.2 nm and length up to several microns were successfully synthesized and purified using a catalyst-free colloidal synthesis method followed by a stepwise purification strategy. The NWs have bright photoluminescence (PL) with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of about 30% after surface treatment. Large blue-shifted UV\xe2\x80\x93vis absorption and PL spectra have been observed due to strong two-dimensional quantum confinement effects. A small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) pattern shows the periodic packing of the ultrathin NWs along the radial direction, demonstrates the narrow radial distribution of the wires, and emphasizes the deep intercalation of the surfactants. Despite the extreme aspect ratios of the ultrathin NWs, their composition and the resulting optical properties can be readily tuned by an anion-exchange reaction with good morphology preservation. These bright ultrathin NWs may be used as a model system to study strong quantum confinement effects in a one-dimensional halide perovskite system."
"We report the stereoselective synthesis of a left-handed trefoil knot from a tris(2,6-pyridinedicarboxamide) oligomer with six chiral centers using a lanthanide(III) ion template. The oligomer folds around the lanthanide ion to form an overhand knot complex of single handedness. Subsequent joining of the overhand knot end groups by ring-closing olefin metathesis affords a single enantiomer of the trefoil knot in 90% yield. The knot topology and handedness were confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography. The pseudo-D3-symmetric knot was employed as an asymmetric catalyst in Mukaiyama aldol reactions, generating enantioselectivities of up to 83:17 er, which are significantly higher than those obtained with a comparable unknotted ligand complex."
"A major goal in metalloprotein design is to build protein scaffolds from scratch that allow precise control over metal coordination. A particular challenge in this regard is the construction of allosteric systems in which metal coordination equilibria are coupled to other chemical events that take place elsewhere in the protein scaffold. We previously developed a metal-templated self-assembly strategy (MeTIR) to build supramolecular protein complexes with tailorable interfaces from monomeric building blocks. Here, using this strategy, we have incorporated multiple disulfide bonds into the interfaces of a Zn-templated cytochrome cb562 assembly in order to create mechanical strain on the quaternary structural level. Structural and biophysical analyses indicate that this strain leads to an allosteric system in which Zn2+ binding and dissociation are remotely coupled to the formation and breakage of a disulfide bond over a distance of >14 \xc3\x85. The breakage of this strained bond upon Zn2+ dissociation occurs in the absence of any reductants, apparently through a hydrolytic mechanism that generates a sulfenic acid/thiol pair."
"Enzymes capable of performing dehalogenating reactions have attracted tremendous contemporary attention due to their potential application in the bioremediation of anthropogenic polyhalogenated persistent organic pollutants. Nature, in particular the marine environment, is also a prolific source of polyhalogenated organic natural products. The study of the biosynthesis of these natural products has furnished a diverse array of halogenation biocatalysts, but thus far no examples of dehalogenating enzymes have been reported from a secondary metabolic pathway. Here we show that the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of the highly brominated marine bacterial product pentabromopseudilin is catalyzed by an unusual debrominase Bmp8 that utilizes a redox thiol mechanism to remove the C-2 bromine atom of 2,3,4,5-tetrabromopyrrole to facilitate oxidative coupling to 2,4-dibromophenol. To the best of our knowledge, Bmp8 is first example of a dehalogenating enzyme from the established genetic and biochemical context of a natural product biosynthetic pathway."
"Novel octanuclear NHC complexes of gold(I) and silver(I) form metallocavitand structures with very defined tubular cavities and are able to selectively host linear molecules, exemplarily demonstrating 1,8-diaminooctane as a model guest molecule. The solubility of the host-compounds is easily adjusted by simple anion exchange reactions so that the compounds can be made soluble in water wherein they exhibit a high longtime stability. The gold(I) complex is emissive in aqueous solutions, which enables a determination of the binding constant to the diamine via luminescence quenching. The host\xe2\x80\x93guest interaction was further investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry, NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography."
"Besides the single crystals, ferroelectric materials are actually widely used in the forms of the polycrystals like ceramics. Multiaxial ferroelectrics with multiple equivalent polarization directions are preferable for such applications, because more equivalent ferroelectric axes allow random spontaneous polarization vectors to be oriented along the electric field to achieve a larger polarization after poling. Most of ceramic ferroelectrics like BaTiO3 have equivalent ferroelectric axes no more than three. We herein describe a molecular-ionic ferroelectric with 12 equivalent ferroelectric axes: tetraethylammonium perchlorate, whose number of axes is the most in the known ferroelectrics. Appearance of so many equivalent ferroelectric axes benefits from the plastic phase transition, because the plastic phase usually crystallizes in a highly symmetric cubic system. A perfect macroscopic ferroelectricity can be obtained on the polycrystalline film of this material. This finding opened an avenue constructing multiaxial ferroelectrics for applications as polycrystalline materials."
"A new strategy for the functionalization of sterically hindered terminal olefins is reported. Alkenes bearing quaternary carbons at the allylic or homoallylic position are readily oxidized to the corresponding aldehydes by palladium/copper/nitrite catalysis. A broad range of functional groups including esters, nitriles, silyl ethers, vinylogous esters, ketones, lactones, and \xce\xb2-ketoesters are tolerated under the reaction conditions. The crude aldehyde products can be transformed further, enabling direct conversion of hindered terminal alkenes to various other synthetically useful functional groups, resulting in formal anti-Markovnikov hydroamination, among other transformations."
Catalytic synthesis of nonracemic P-chiral phosphine derivatives remains a significant challenge. Here we report Cu-catalyzed enantioselective arylation of secondary phosphine oxides with diaryliodonium salts for the synthesis of tertiary phosphine oxides with high enantiomeric excess. The new process is demonstrated on a wide range of substrates and leads to products that are well-established P-chiral catalysts and ligands.
"Single-residue mutations at Gly12 (G12X) in the GTP-ase protein K-Ras can lead to activation of different downstream signaling pathways, depending on the identity of the mutation, through a poorly defined mechanism. Herein, native mass spectrometry combined with top-down ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) was employed to investigate the structural changes occurring from G12X mutations of K-Ras. Complexes between K-Ras or the G12X mutants and guanosine 5\xe2\x80\xb2-diphosphate (GDP) or GDPnP (a stable GTP analogue) were transferred to the gas phase by nano-electrospray ionization and characterized using UVPD. Variations in the efficiencies of backbone cleavages were observed upon substitution of GDPnP for GDP as well as for the G12X mutants relative to wild-type K-Ras. An increase in the fragmentation efficiency in the segment containing the first 50 residues was observed for the K-Ras/GDPnP complexes relative to the K-Ras/GDP complexes, whereas a decrease in fragmentation efficiency occurred in the segment containing the last 100 residues. Within these general regions, the specific residues at which changes in fragmentation efficiency occurred correspond to the phosphate and guanine binding regions, respectively, and are indicative of a change in the binding motif upon replacement of the ligand (GDP versus GDPnP). Notably, unique changes in UVPD were observed for each G12X mutant with the cysteine and serine mutations exhibiting similar UVPD changes whereas the valine mutation was significantly different. These findings suggest a mechanism that links the identity of the G12X substitution to different downstream effects through long-range conformational or dynamic effects as detected by variations in UVPD fragmentation."
"Charge recombination between oxidized dyes attached to mesoporous TiO2 and electrons in the TiO2 was studied in inert electrolytes using transient absorption spectroscopy. Simultaneously, hole transport within the dye monolayers was monitored by transient absorption anisotropy. The rate of recombination decreased when hole transport was inhibited selectively, either by decreasing the dye surface coverage or by changing the electrolyte environment. From Monte Carlo simulations of electron and hole diffusion in a particle, modeled as a cubic structure, we identify the conditions under which hole lifetime depends on the hole diffusion coefficient for the case of normal (disorder free) diffusion. From simulations of transient absorption and transient absorption anisotropy, we find that the rate and the dispersive character of hole transport in the dye monolayer observed spectroscopically can be explained by incomplete coverage and disorder in the monolayer. We show that dispersive transport in the dye monolayer combined with inhomogeneity in the TiO2 surface reactivity can contribute to the observed stretched electron\xe2\x80\x93hole recombination dynamics and electron density dependence of hole lifetimes. Our experimental and computational analysis of lateral processes at interfaces can be applied to investigate and optimize charge transport and recombination in solar energy conversion devices using electrodes functionalized with molecular light absorbers and catalysts."
"Histone proteins are essential for the organization, expression, and inheritance of genetic material for eukaryotic cells. A centromere-specific H3 histone variant, centromere protein A (CENP-A), shares about 50% amino acid sequence identity with H3. CENP-A is required for packaging the centromere and for the proper separation of chromosomes during mitosis. Despite their distinct biological functions, previously reported crystal structures of the CENP-A/H4 and H3/H4 dimers reveal a high degree of similarity. In this work, we characterize the structural dynamics of CENP-A/H4 and H3/H4 dimers based on a dual-resolution approach, using both microsecond-scale explicit-solvent all-atom and coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our data show that the H4 histone is significantly more rigid compared with the H3 histone and its variant CENP-A, hence, serving as a reinforcing structural element within the histone core. We report that the CENP-A/H4 dimer is significantly more dynamic than its canonical counterpart H3/H4, and our results provide a physical explanation for this flexibility. Further, we observe that the centromere-specific chaperone Holliday Junction Recognition Protein (HJURP) stabilizes the CENP-A/H4 dimer by forming a specific electrostatic interaction network. Finally, replacing CENP-A S68 with E68 disrupts the binding interface between CENP-A and HJURP in all-atom MD simulation, and consistently, in vivo experiments demonstrate that replacing CENP-A S68 with E68 disrupts CENP-A\xe2\x80\x99s localization to the centromere. Based on all our results, we propose that, during the CENP-A/H4 deposition process, the chaperone HJURP protects various substructures of the dimer, serving both as a folding and binding chaperone."
"Galactose oxidase (GO) is a copper-dependent enzyme that accomplishes 2e\xe2\x80\x93 substrate oxidation by pairing a single copper with an unusual cysteinylated tyrosine (Cys-Tyr) redox cofactor. Previous studies have demonstrated that the post-translational biogenesis of Cys-Tyr is copper- and O2-dependent, resulting in a self-processing enzyme system. To investigate the mechanism of cofactor biogenesis in GO, the active-site structure of Cu(I)-loaded GO was determined using X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on this model. Our results show that the active-site tyrosine lowers the Cu potential to enable the thermodynamically unfavorable 1e\xe2\x80\x93 reduction of O2, and the resulting Cu(II)\xe2\x80\x93O2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x93 is activated toward H atom abstraction from cysteine. The final step of biogenesis is a concerted reaction involving coordinated Tyr ring deprotonation where Cu(II) coordination enables formation of the Cys-Tyr cross-link. These spectroscopic and computational results highlight the role of the Cu(I) in enabling O2 activation by 1e\xe2\x80\x93 and the role of the resulting Cu(II) in enabling substrate activation for biogenesis."
"Versatile and readily available battery materials compatible with a range of electrode configurations and cell designs are desirable for renewable energy storage. Here we report a promising class of materials based on redox active colloids (RACs) that are inherently modular in their design and overcome challenges faced by small-molecule organic materials for battery applications, such as crossover and chemical/morphological stability. RACs are cross-linked polymer spheres, synthesized with uniform diameters between 80 and 800 nm, and exhibit reversible redox activity as single particles, as monolayer films, and in the form of flowable dispersions. Viologen-based RACs display reversible cycling, accessing up to 99% of their capacity and 99 \xc2\xb1 1% Coulombic efficiency over 50 cycles by bulk electrolysis owing to efficient, long-distance intraparticle charge transfer. Ferrocene-based RACs paired with viologen-based RACs cycled efficiently in a nonaqueous redox flow battery employing a simple size-selective separator, thus demonstrating a possible application that benefits from their colloidal dimensions. The unprecedented versatility in RAC synthetic and electrochemical design opens new avenues for energy storage."
"An efficient palladium-catalyzed site-selective arylation of \xce\xb3-vinyl-\xce\xb3-lactone by aryl boronic acid has been developed. \xce\xb3-Vinyl-\xce\xb3-lactone 1a has been contemplated as allyl electrophile donor for allylic arylation via \xcf\x80-allyl palladium intermediate using 1.5 equiv of aryl boronic acid 2. Using 3.0 equiv of the latter resulted in mono-arylation by allylic substitution and subsequent site-selective second arylation by directed allylic C\xe2\x80\x93H activation giving stereoselectively anti-\xce\xb3-(aryl,styryl)-\xce\xb2-hydroxy acids. Presence of O2 was crucial for the second arylation via Pd(II) catalysis. Thus, a good synergy of dual catalysis by Pd(0) and Pd(II) was observed. This methodology has been elaborated to synthesize highly substituted tetrahydrofurans including aryl-Hagen\xe2\x80\x99s gland lactone analogues via intramolecular iodoetherification."
"Using ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS), we studied the adsorption and reactions of CO2 and CO2 + H2 on the Ni(111) surface to identify the surface chemical state and the nature of the adsorbed species during the methanation reaction. In 200 mTorr CO2, we found that NiO is formed from CO2 dissociation into CO and atomic oxygen. Additionally, carbonate (CO32\xe2\x80\x93) is present on the surface from further reaction of CO2 with NiO. The addition of H2 into the reaction environment leads to reduction of NiO and the disappearance of CO32\xe2\x80\x93. At temperatures >160 \xc2\xb0C, CO adsorbed on hollow sites, and atomic carbon and OH species are present on the surface. We conclude that the methanation reaction proceeds via dissociation of CO2, followed by reduction of CO to atomic carbon and its hydrogenation to methane."
"Controlled lateral quantum confinement in single-layer transition-metal chalcogenides (TMCs) can potentially combine the unique properties of two-dimensional (2D) exciton with the size-tunability of exciton energy, creating the single-layer quantum dots (SQDs) of 2D TMC materials. However, exploring such opportunities has been challenging due to the limited ability to produce well-defined SQDs with sufficiently high quality and size control, in conjunction with the commonly observed inconsistency in the optical properties. Here, we report an effective method to synthesize high-quality and size-controlled SQDs of WSe2 via multilayer quantum dots (MQDs) precursors, which enables grasping a clear picture of the role of lateral confinement on the optical properties of the 2D exciton. From the single-particle optical spectra and polarization anisotropy of WSe2 SQDs of varying sizes in addition to their ensemble data, we reveal how the properties of 2D exciton in single-layer TMCs evolve with increasing lateral quantum confinement."
"This work shows how to create covalently bound nanoparticle dyad assemblies on a colloidal template and studies photoinduced charge transfer in them. New results are reported for how the electron-transfer rate changes with the inter-nanoparticle distance and the energy band offset of the nanoparticles (reaction Gibbs energy). The experimental findings show that the distance dependence is consistent with an electron tunneling mechanism. The dependence of the rate on the energy band offset is found to be consistent with Marcus theory, as long as one performs a sum over final electronic states. These results indicate that our understanding of electron transfer in molecular donor\xe2\x80\x93bridge\xe2\x80\x93acceptor assemblies can be translated to describe nanoparticle\xe2\x80\x93bridge\xe2\x80\x93nanoparticle assemblies."
"A mechanism study to identify the elements that control the chemoselectivity of metal-catalyzed N-atom transfer reactions of styryl azides is presented. Our studies show that the proclivity of the metal N-aryl nitrene to participate in sp3-C\xe2\x80\x93H bond amination or electrocyclization reactions can be controlled by either the substrate or the catalyst. Electrocyclization is favored for mono-\xce\xb2-substituted and sterically noncongested styryl azides, whereas sp3-C\xe2\x80\x93H bond amination through an H-atom abstraction\xe2\x80\x93radical recombination mechanism is preferred when a tertiary allylic reaction center is present. Even when a weakened allylic C\xe2\x80\x93H bond is present, our data suggest that the indole is still formed through an electrocyclization instead of a common allyl radical intermediate. The site selectivity of metal N-aryl nitrenes was found to be controlled by the choice of catalyst: Ir(I)-alkene complexes trigger electrocyclization processes while Fe(III) porphyrin complexes catalyze sp3-C\xe2\x80\x93H bond amination in substrates where Rh2(II) carboxylate catalysts provide both products."
"Mammalian survival depends on ultrasensitive olfactory detection of volatile sulfur compounds, since these compounds can signal the presence of rancid food, O2 depleted atmospheres, and predators (through carnivore excretions). Skunks exploit this sensitivity with their noxious spray. In commerce, natural and liquefied gases are odorized with t-BuSH and EtSH, respectively, as warnings. The 100-million-fold difference in olfactory perception between structurally similar EtSH and EtOH has long puzzled those studying olfaction. Mammals detect thiols and other odorants using odorant receptors (ORs), members of the family of seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Understanding the regulator cofactors and response of ORs is particularly challenging due to the lack of X-ray structural models. Here, we combine computational modeling and site-directed mutagenesis with saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy and measurements of the receptor response profiles. We find that human thiol receptor OR2T11 responds specifically to gas odorants t-BuSH and EtSH requiring ionic copper for its robust activation and that this role of copper is mimicked by ionic and nanoparticulate silver. While copper is both an essential nutrient for life and, in excess, a hallmark of various pathologies and neurodegenerative diseases, its involvement in human olfaction has not been previously demonstrated. When screened against a series of alcohols, thiols, sulfides, and metal-coordinating ligands, OR2T11 responds with enhancement by copper to the mouse semiochemical CH3SCH2SH and derivatives, to four-membered cyclic sulfide thietane and to one- to four-carbon straight- and branched-chain and five-carbon branched-chain thiols but not to longer chain thiols, suggesting compact receptor dimensions. Alcohols are unreactive."
"Efficient generation of active oxygen-related radicals plays an essential role in boosting advanced oxidation process. To promote photocatalytic oxidation for gaseous pollutant over g-C3N4, a solid\xe2\x80\x93gas interfacial Fenton reaction is coupled into alkalinized g-C3N4-based photocatalyst to effectively convert photocatalytic generation of H2O2 into oxygen-related radicals. This system includes light energy as power, alkalinized g-C3N4-based photocatalyst as an in situ and robust H2O2 generator, and surface-decorated Fe3+ as a trigger of H2O2 conversion, which attains highly efficient and universal activity for photodegradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Taking the photooxidation of isopropanol as model reaction, this system achieves a photoactivity of 2\xe2\x80\x933 orders of magnitude higher than that of pristine g-C3N4, which corresponds to a high apparent quantum yield of 49% at around 420 nm. In-situ electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and sacrificial-reagent incorporated photocatalytic characterizations indicate that the notable photoactivity promotion could be ascribed to the collaboration between photocarriers (electrons and holes) and Fenton process to produce abundant and reactive oxygen-related radicals. The strategy of coupling solid\xe2\x80\x93gas interfacial Fenton process into semiconductor-based photocatalysis provides a facile and promising solution to the remediation of air pollution via solar energy."
"The thermosalient crystals of terephthalic acid are extraordinarily mechanically compliant and reversibly shape-shift between two forms with different crystal habits. While the transition of form II to form I is spontaneous, the transition of form I to form II is latent and can be triggered by applying local mechanical stress, whereby crystals leap several centimeters in air. This mechanosalient effect (mechanically stimulated motility) is due to sudden release of strain that has accrued in the crystal of form I, which is a metastable structure at ambient conditions. High-speed optical analysis and serial scanning electron microscopy reveal that the mechanical effect is due to rapid reshaping of crystal domains on a millisecond time scale triggered by mechanical stimulation. Mechanically pre-deformed crystals taken over the thermal phase transition exhibit memory effects and partially regain their shape, while cracked, sliced, or otherwise damaged crystals tend to recover their macroscopic integrity by restorative action of intermolecular \xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93\xcf\x80 interactions in a manner which resembles the behavior of shape-memory and self-healing polymers. These observations provide additional evidence that the thermo-/photo-/mechanosalient effects are macroscopic manifestations of martensitic-type transitions in molecular solids."
"Aromaticity is a central concept in chemistry. Reaction pathways involving reversible ligand dearomatization sequences emerged as a powerful tool for bond activation by metal complexes. Exploring this concept with a metal-free system, we have synthesized a pyridine-coordinated aminoborane which undergoes a temperature-induced formal dearomatization of the pyridine ring. NMR studies and DFT calculations revealed that this formal dearomatization sequence led to an aromaticity switch and the formation of a six-\xcf\x80-electron boron-containing heteroaromatic system. Disrupting this aromatic system by coordination of an amine or a carboxylic acid to the boron center enabled N\xe2\x80\x93H activation and O\xe2\x80\x93H cleavage, leading to an unprecedented reversal aromaticity switch."
"Hydrogen bonding with fluoride is a key interaction encountered when analyzing the mode of action of 5\xe2\x80\xb2-fluoro-5\xe2\x80\xb2-deoxyadenosine synthase, the only known enzyme capable of catalyzing the formation of a C\xe2\x80\x93F bond from F\xe2\x80\x93. Further understanding of the effect of hydrogen bonding on the structure and reactivity of complexed fluoride is therefore important for catalysis and numerous other applications, such as anion supramolecular chemistry. Herein we disclose a detailed study examining the structure of 18 novel urea\xe2\x80\x93fluoride complexes in the solid state, by X-ray and neutron diffraction, and in solution phase and explore the reactivity of these complexes as a fluoride source in SN2 chemistry. Experimental data show that the structure, coordination strength, and reactivity of the urea\xe2\x80\x93fluoride complexes are tunable by modifying substituents on the urea receptor. Hammett analysis of aryl groups on the urea indicates that fluoride binding is dependent on \xcf\x83p and \xcf\x83m parameters with stronger binding being observed for electron-deficient urea ligands. For the first time, defined urea\xe2\x80\x93fluoride complexes are used as fluoride-binding reagents for the nucleophilic substitution of a model alkyl bromide. The reaction is slower in comparison with known alcohol\xe2\x80\x93fluoride complexes, but SN2 is largely favored over E2, at a ratio surpassing all hydrogen-bonded complexes documented in the literature for the model alkyl bromide employed. Increased second-order rate constants at higher dilution support the hypothesis that the reactive species is a 1:1 urea\xe2\x80\x93fluoride complex of type [UF]\xe2\x88\x92 (U = urea) resulting from partial dissociation of the parent compound [U2F]\xe2\x88\x92. The dissociation processes can be quantified through a combination of UV and NMR assays, including DOSY and HOESY analyses that illuminate the complexation state and H-bonding in solution."
"Understanding and further designing new layered Li(NixMnyCoz)O2 (NMC) (x + y + z = 1) materials with optimized thermal stability is important to rechargeable Li batteries (LIBs) for electrical vehicles (EV). Using ab initio calculations combined with experiments, we clarified how the thermal stability of NMC materials can be tuned by the most unstable oxygen, which is determined by the local coordination structure unit (LCSU) of oxygen (TM(Ni, Mn, Co)3-O-Li3\xe2\x80\x93x\xe2\x80\xb2): each O atom bonds with three transition metals (TM) from the TM-layer and three to zero Li from fully discharged to charged states from the Li-layer. Under this model, how the lithium content, valence states of Ni, contents of Ni, Mn, and Co, and Ni/Li disorder to tune the thermal stability of NMC materials by affecting the sites, content, and the release temperature of the most unstable oxygen is proposed. The synergistic effect between Li vacancies and raised valence state of Ni during delithiation process can aggravate instability of oxygen, and oxygen coordinated with more nickel (especially with high valence state) in LSCU becomes more unstable at a fixed delithiation state. The Ni/Li mixing would decrease the thermal stability of the \xe2\x80\x9cNi\xe2\x95\x90Mn\xe2\x80\x9d group NMC materials but benefit the thermal stability of \xe2\x80\x9cNi-rich\xe2\x80\x9d group, because the Ni in the Li layer would form 180\xc2\xb0 Ni\xe2\x80\x93O\xe2\x80\x93Ni super exchange chains in \xe2\x80\x9cNi-rich\xe2\x80\x9d NMC materials. Mn and Co doping can tune the initial valence state of Ni, local coordination environment of oxygen, and the Ni/Li disorder, thus to tune the thermal stability directly."
"Methylation is a fundamental mechanism used in Nature to modify the structure and function of biomolecules, including proteins, DNA, RNA, and metabolites. Methyl groups are predominantly installed into biomolecules by a large and diverse class of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (MTs), of which there are \xe2\x88\xbc200 known or putative members in the human proteome. Deregulated MT activity contributes to numerous diseases, including cancer, and several MT inhibitors are in clinical development. Nonetheless, a large fraction of the human MT family remains poorly characterized, underscoring the need for new technologies to characterize MTs and their inhibitors in native biological systems. Here, we describe a suite of S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) photoreactive probes and their application in chemical proteomic experiments to profile and enrich a large number of MTs (>50) from human cancer cell lysates with remarkable specificity over other classes of proteins. We further demonstrate that the SAH probes can enrich MT-associated proteins and be used to screen for and assess the selectivity of MT inhibitors, leading to the discovery of a covalent inhibitor of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), an enzyme implicated in cancer and metabolic disorders. The chemical proteomics probes and methods for their utilization reported herein should prove of value for the functional characterization of MTs, MT complexes, and MT inhibitors in mammalian biology and disease."
"We report a functional synthetic model for studying the noncovalent networks (NCNs) required for complex protein functions. The model [2]-catenane is self-assembled from dipeptide building blocks and contains an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and aromatic interactions. Perturbations to the catenane cause compensating changes in the NCNs structure and dynamics, resulting in long-distance changes reminiscent of a protein. Key findings include the notion that NCNs require regions of negative cooperativity, or \xe2\x80\x9cfrustrated\xe2\x80\x9d noncovalent interactions, as a source of potential energy for driving the response. We refer to this potential energy as latent free energy and describe a mechanistic and energetic model for responsive systems."
"\xce\xb1-Boryl ethers, carbonates, and acetals, readily prepared from the corresponding alcohols that are accessed through ketone diboration, react rapidly with hydrogen peroxide to release alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones through the collapse of hemiacetal intermediates. Experiments with \xce\xb1-boryl acetals containing a latent fluorophore clearly demonstrate that cargo can be released inside cells in the presence of exogenous or endogenous hydrogen peroxide. These experiments show that this protocol can be used for drug activation in an oxidative environment without generating toxic byproducts."
"Thienyl di-N-methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronate esters are readily synthesized by electrophilic C\xe2\x80\x93H borylation producing bench stable crystalline solids in good yield and excellent purity. Optimal conditions for the slow release of the boronic acid using KOH as the base in biphasic THF/water mixtures enables the thienyl MIDA boronate esters to be extremely effective homo-bifunctionalized (AA-type) monomers in Suzuki\xe2\x80\x93Miyaura copolymerizations with dibromo-heteroarenes (BB-type monomers). A single polymerization protocol is applicable for the formation of five alternating thienyl copolymers that are (or are close analogues of) state of the art materials used in organic electronics. The five polymers were produced in excellent yields and with high molecular weights comparable to those produced using Stille copolymerization protocols. Therefore, thienyl di-MIDA boronate esters represent bench stable and low toxicity alternatives to highly toxic di-trimethylstannyl AA-type monomers that are currently ubiquitous in the synthesis of these important alternating copolymers."
"The controlled catalytic functionalization of alkanes via the activation of C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds is a significant challenge. Although C\xe2\x80\x93H activation by transition metal catalysts is often suggested to operate via intermediate \xcf\x83-alkane complexes, such transient species are difficult to observe due to their instability in solution. This instability may be controlled by use of solid/gas synthetic techniques that enable the isolation of single-crystals of well-defined \xcf\x83-alkane complexes. Here we show that, using this unique platform, selective alkane C\xe2\x80\x93H activation occurs, as probed by H/D exchange using D2, and that five different isotopomers/isotopologues of the \xcf\x83-alkane complex result, as characterized by single-crystal neutron diffraction studies for three examples. Low-energy fluxional processes associated with the \xcf\x83-alkane ligand are identified using variable-temperature X-ray diffraction, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and periodic DFT calculations. These observations connect \xcf\x83-alkane complexes with their C\xe2\x80\x93H activated products, and demonstrate that alkane-ligand mobility, and selective C\xe2\x80\x93H activation, are possible when these processes occur in the constrained environment of the solid-state."
"The hydrogenolysis of titanium\xe2\x80\x93nitrogen bonds in a series of bis(cyclopentadienyl) titanium amides, hydrazides and imides by proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) is described. Twelve different N\xe2\x80\x93H bond dissociation free energies (BDFEs) among the various nitrogen-containing ligands were measured or calculated, and effects of metal oxidation state and N-ligand substituent were determined. Two metal hydride complexes, (\xce\xb75-C5Me5)(py-Ph)Rh\xe2\x80\x93H (py-Ph = 2-pyridylphenyl, [Rh]-H) and (\xce\xb75-C5R5)(CO)3Cr\xe2\x88\x92H ([Cr]R-H, R= H, Me) were evaluated for formal H atom transfer reactivity and were selected due to their relatively weak M\xe2\x80\x93H bond strengths yet ability to activate and cleave molecular hydrogen. Despite comparable M\xe2\x80\x93H BDFEs, disparate reactivity between the two compounds was observed and was traced to the vastly different acidities of the M\xe2\x80\x93H bonds and overall redox potentials of the molecules. With [Rh]\xe2\x80\x93H, catalytic syntheses of ammonia, silylamine and N,N-dimethylhydrazine have been accomplished from the corresponding titanium(IV) complex using H2 as the stoichiometric H atom source. The data presented in this study provides the thermochemical foundation for the synthesis of NH3 by proton coupled electron transfer at a well-defined transition metal center."
"We present the first examples of atomic-resolution crystal data for the \xce\xb2-peptide 12/10-helix from oligomers of cis-2-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid (cis-ACHC) with alternating chirality. The local conformations of two enantiomeric cis-ACHC dimer units suggested that a chiral \xce\xb2-peptide may adopt both right-handed and left-handed helical conformations in solution. To probe the conformational behavior of 12/10-helical \xce\xb2-peptides, the two reference helices with a single handedness were synthesized with a more rigidified cis-ACHC derivative. Comparison with these reference helices at low temperature revealed that a chiral cis-ACHC oligomer with alternating chirality indeed displays 12/10-helical conformations with both handedness that equilibrate rapidly in solution. This is a very rare example of chiral oligomers with helix inversion ability. The 12/10-helical backbone should be a valuable addition to potential scaffolds for applications involving helices with dynamic folding propensity."
"Safranine O, a synthetic dye, was found to inhibit growth of ice at millimolar concentrations with an activity comparable to that of highly evolved antifreeze glycoproteins. Safranine inhibits growth of ice crystals along the crystallographic a-axis, resulting in bipyramidal needles extended along the <0001> directions as well as and plane-specific thermal hysteresis (TH) activity. The interaction of safranine with ice is reversible, distinct from the previously reported behavior of antifreeze proteins. Spectroscopy and molecular dynamics indicate that safranine forms aggregates in aqueous solution at micromolar concentrations. Metadynamics simulations and aggregation theory suggested that as many as 30 safranine molecules were preorganized in stacks at the concentrations where ice growth inhibition was observed. The simulations and single-crystal X-ray structure of safranine revealed regularly spaced amino and methyl substituents in the aggregates, akin to the ice-binding site of antifreeze proteins. Collectively, these observations suggest an unusual link between supramolecular assemblies of small molecules and functional proteins."
"S-glycosides, S-2-(2-propylthio)benzyl (SPTB) glycosides, were converted to the corresponding oxidized glycosyl donors, S-2-(2-propylsulfinyl)benzyl (SPSB) glycosides, by simple and selective oxidation. Treatment of disarmed SPSB donor and various acceptors with triflic anhydride provided the desired glycosides in good to excellent yields. Meanwhile, observation of thiosulfinate, thiosulfonate, and disulfide suggested that the leaving group was activated via an interrupted Pummerer reaction. The disarmed SPSB thioglycosyl donors could be selectively activated in the presence of various thioglycosides with remote activation mode. Finally, two natural hepatoprotective glycosides, Leonoside E and Leonuriside B, were efficiently synthesized in a convergent manner with this newly developed method."
"A mild base-catalyzed strategy for the isomerization of allylic alcohols and allylic ethers has been developed. Experimental and computational investigations indicate that transition metal catalysts are not required when basic additives are present. As in the case of using transition metals under basic conditions, the isomerization catalyzed solely by base also follows a stereospecific pathway. The reaction is initiated by a rate-limiting deprotonation. Formation of an intimate ion pair between an allylic anion and the conjugate acid of the base results in efficient transfer of chirality. Through this mechanism, stereochemical information contained in the allylic alcohols is transferred to the ketone products. The stereospecific isomerization is also applicable for the first time to allylic ethers, yielding synthetically valuable enantioenriched (up to 97% ee) enol ethers."
"The synthesis and biological evaluation of chromane-containing bryostatin analogues WN-2\xe2\x80\x93WN-7 and the previously reported salicylate-based analogue WN-8 are described. Analogues WN-2\xe2\x80\x93WN-7 are prepared through convergent assembly of the chromane-containing fragment B-I with the \xe2\x80\x9cbinding domain\xe2\x80\x9d fragment A-I or its C26-des-methyl congener, fragment A-II. The synthesis of fragment B-I features enantioselective double C\xe2\x80\x93H allylation of 1,3-propanediol to form the C2-symmetric diol 3 and Heck cyclization of bromo-diene 5 to form the chromane core. The synthesis of salicylate WN-8 is accomplished through the union of fragments A-III and B-II. The highest binding affinities for PKC\xce\xb1 are observed for the C26-des-methyl analogues WN-3 (Ki = 63.9 nM) and WN-7 (Ki = 63.1 nM). All analogues, WN-2\xe2\x80\x93WN-8, inhibited growth of Toledo cells, with the most potent analogue being WN-7. This response, however, does not distinguish between phorbol ester-like and bryostatin-like behavior. In contrast, while many of the analogues contain a conserved C-ring in the binding domain and other features common to analogues with bryostatin-like properties, all analogues evaluated in the U937 proliferation and cell attachment assays displayed phorbol ester-like and/or toxic behavior, including WN-8, for which \xe2\x80\x9cbryostatin-like PKC modulatory activities\xe2\x80\x9d previously was suggested solely on the basis of PKC binding. These results underscore the importance of considering downstream biological effects, as tumor suppression cannot be inferred from potent PKC binding."
"The effects of aryl ring ortho-, meta-, and para-substitution on site selectivity and enantioselectivity were investigated in the following reactions: (1) enantioselective Pd-catalyzed redox-relay Heck reaction of arylboronic acids, (2) Pd-catalyzed \xce\xb2-aryl elimination of triarylmethanols, and (3) benzoylformate decarboxylase-catalyzed enantioselective benzoin condensation of benzaldehydes. Through these studies, it is demonstrated that the electronic and steric effects of various substituents on selectivities obtained in these reactions can be described by NBO charges, the IR carbonyl stretching frequency, and Sterimol values of various substituted benzoic acids. An extended compilation of NBO charges and IR carbonyl stretching frequencies of various substituted benzoic acids was used as an alternative to Hammett values. These parameters provide a correlative tool that allows for the analysis of a much greater range of substituent effects because they can also account for proximal and remote steric effects."
"We report on the heterogeneous sensitization of metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework (MOF)-driven metal-embedded metal oxide (M@MO) complex catalysts onto semiconductor metal oxide (SMO) nanofibers (NFs) via electrospinning for markedly enhanced chemical gas sensing. ZIF-8-derived Pd-loaded ZnO nanocubes (Pd@ZnO) were sensitized on both the interior and the exterior of WO3 NFs, resulting in the formation of multiheterojunction Pd\xe2\x80\x93ZnO and ZnO\xe2\x80\x93WO3 interfaces. The Pd@ZnO loaded WO3 NFs were found to exhibit unparalleled toluene sensitivity (Rair/Rgas = 4.37 to 100 ppb), fast gas response speed (\xe2\x88\xbc20 s) and superior cross-selectivity against other interfering gases. These results demonstrate that MOF-derived M@MO complex catalysts can be functionalized within an electrospun nanofiber scaffold, thereby creating multiheterojunctions, essential for improving catalytic sensor sensitization."
"Chemiluminescence is among the most sensitive methods for achieving a high signal-to-noise ratio in various chemical and biological applications. We have developed a modular practical synthetic route for preparation of turn-ON fluorophore-tethered dioxetane chemiluminescent probes. The chemiluminescent emission of the probes was significantly amplified through an energy-transfer mechanism under physiological conditions. Two probes were composed with green and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dyes tethered to Schaap\xe2\x80\x99s dioxetane. While both probes were able to provide chemiluminescence in vivo images following subcutaneous injection, only the NIR probe could provide a chemiluminescence image following intraperitoneal injection. These are the first in vivo images produced by Schaap\xe2\x80\x99s dioxetane chemiluminescence probes with no need of an enhancer. Previously, chemiluminescence cell images could only be obtained with a luciferin-based probe. Our NIR probe was able to image cells transfected with \xce\xb2-galactosidase gene by chemiluminescence microscopy. We also report, for the first time, the instability of dioxetane\xe2\x80\x93fluorophore conjugates to ambient light. Our synthetic route effectively overcomes this limitation through a late-stage functionalization of the dioxetane intermediate. We anticipate that our practical synthetic methodology will be useful for preparation of various chemiluminescent probes for numerous applications."
Organic crystals can be engineered with slip planes as artifical layers in the crystal structure making them extremely bendable without breaking.
"This is an exciting time for the field of bio-nano science: enormous progress has been made in recent years, especially in academic research, and materials developed and studied in this area are poised to make a substantial impact in real-world applications. Herein, we discuss ways to leverage the strengths of the field, current limitations, and valuable lessons learned from neighboring fields that can be adopted to accelerate scientific discovery and translational research in bio-nano science. We identify and discuss five interconnected topics: (i) the advantages of cumulative research; (ii) the necessity of aligning projects with research priorities; (iii) the value of transparent science; (iv) the opportunities presented by \xe2\x80\x9cdark data\xe2\x80\x9d; and (v) the importance of establishing bio-nano standards."
"Serial crystallography at last generation X-ray synchrotron sources and free electron lasers enabled data collection with micrometer and even submicrometer size crystals, which have resulted in amazing progress in structural biology. However, imaging of small crystals, which although is highly demanded, remains a challenge, especially in the case of membrane protein crystals. Here we describe a new extremely sensitive method of the imaging of protein crystals that is based on coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering."
"Thiopeptides are structurally complex, bioactive natural products derived from ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides. A remarkable set of enzymes were recently revealed to catalyze the formation of the core trithiazolylpyridine of thiopeptides via a formal [4 + 2] cycloaddition. These pyridine synthases typically act late in thiopeptide biosynthesis to affect macrocyclization and cleavage of the N-terminal leader peptide, making them potentially useful biocatalysts for preparation of new thiopeptide variants. Herein we investigate the leader peptide requirements for TclM from thiocillin biosynthesis in Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579. Through a series of truncations, we define a minimum recognition sequence (RS) that is necessary and sufficient for TclM activity. This RS can be readily synthesized and ligated to linear thiopeptide cores prepared via solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), giving an efficient and modular route to thiopeptide variants. We exploit this strategy to define C-terminal core peptide requirements and explore the differences in promiscuity of two pyridine synthases, TclM and TbtD, ultimately examining their ability to access new structural variants."
"Detection of point mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA and RNA has a growing importance in biology, biotechnology, and medicine. For the application at hand, hybridization assays are often used. Traditionally, they differentiate point mutations only at elevated temperatures (>40 \xc2\xb0C) and in narrow intervals (\xce\x94T = 1\xe2\x80\x9310 \xc2\xb0C). The current study demonstrates that a specially designed multistranded DNA probe can differentiate point mutations in the range of 5\xe2\x80\x9340 \xc2\xb0C. This unprecedentedly broad ambient-temperature range is enabled by a controlled combination of (i) nonequilibrium hybridization conditions and (ii) a mismatch-induced increase of equilibration time in respect to that of a fully matched complex, which we dub \xe2\x80\x9ckinetic inversion\xe2\x80\x9d."
"Clusters have been identified as important growth intermediates during group III\xe2\x80\x93V quantum dot (QD) formation. Here we report a one-solvent protocol that integrates synthesis, purification, and mass characterization of indium phosphide (InP) QD growth mixtures. The use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) successfully tracks the evolution of clusters and the formation of QDs throughout the synthesis. Similar clusters are observed during the formation of large particles, suggesting that these clusters serve as a reservoir for QD formation. Combining MALDI and NMR techniques further enables us to extract extinction coefficients and construct sizing curves for cluster-free InP QDs. The use of MALDI MS opens new opportunities for characterization and mechanistic studies of small-sized air-sensitive clusters or QDs."
"We report a simple strategy for the creation of large-area nanoporous hybrid films of silica, carbon, and gold on polyethylene terephthalate via photothermal processing. This method enables the selective heating of light-absorbing thin films on low-temperature substrates using sub-millisecond light pulses generated by a xenon flash lamp. The film contains gold nanoparticles as the nanoheaters to convert light energy to heat, a sacrificial block copolymer surfactant to generate mesopores, and cross-linked polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane as the silica source to form the skeleton of the porous structure. Hierarchical porous structures are achieved in the films after photothermal treatment, with uniform mesopores (44\xe2\x80\x9348 nm) on the surface and interconnected macropores (>50 nm) underneath resulting from a foaming effect during release of gaseous decomposition products. The loading of gold nanoparticles is up to 43 wt % in the product, with less than 2 wt % organic residue. This rapid and large-area process for the synthetis of porous structures is compatible with roll-to-roll manufacturing for the fabrication of flexible devices."
"Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is a gas that may play important roles in mammalian and bacterial biology, but its study is limited by a lack of suitable donor molecules. We report here the use of N-thiocarboxyanhydrides (NTAs) as COS donors that release the gas in a sustained manner under biologically relevant conditions with innocuous peptide byproducts. Carbonic anhydrase converts COS into H2S, allowing NTAs to serve as either COS or H2S donors, depending on the availability of the enzyme. Analysis of the pseudo-first-order H2S release rate under biologically relevant conditions revealed a release half-life of 75 min for the small molecule NTA under investigation. A polynorbornene bearing pendant NTAs made by ring-opening metathesis polymerization was also synthesized to generate a polymeric COS/H2S donor. A half-life of 280 min was measured for the polymeric donor. Endothelial cell proliferation studies revealed an enhanced rate of proliferation for cells treated with the NTA over untreated controls."
"Two theoretically designed and one experimentally reported pincer-type phosphorus compounds are found to be active for the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide with ammonia\xe2\x80\x93borane. DFT, ONIOM(CCSD(T):MP2), and CCSD(T) computational results demonstrated that the reaction occurs through phosphorus\xe2\x80\x93ligand cooperative catalysis, which provides an unprecedented protocol for metal-free CO2 conversion. The phosphorus compounds with the NNN ligand are more active than those with the ONO ligand. The planar conjugate ligand considerably improves the efficiency of the catalyst."
"Despite their various potential applications, InAs colloidal quantum dots have attracted considerably less attention than more classical II-VI materials because of their complex syntheses that require hazardous precursors. Recently, aminophosphine has been introduced as a cheap, easy-to-use and efficient phosphorus precursor to synthesize InP quantum dots. Here, we use aminopnictogen precursors to implement a similar approach for synthesizing InAs quantum dots. We develop a two-step method based on the combination of aminoarsine as the arsenic precursor and aminophosphine as the reducing agent. This results in state-of-the-art InAs quantum dots with respect to the size dispersion and band gap range. Moreover, we present shell coating procedures that lead to InAs/ZnS(e) core/shell quantum dots that emit in the infrared region. This innovative synthesis approach can greatly facilitate the research on InAs quantum dots and may lead to synthesis protocols for a wide range of III-V quantum dots."
"We present the direct and stereoretentive deuteration of primary amines using Ru-bMepi (bMepi = 1,3-(6\xe2\x80\xb2-methyl-2\xe2\x80\xb2-pyridylimino)isoindolate) complexes and D2O. High deuterium incorporation occurs at the \xce\xb1-carbon (70\xe2\x80\x9399%). For \xce\xb1-chiral amines, complete retention of stereochemistry is achieved when using an electron-deficient Ru catalyst. The retention of enantiomeric purity is attributed to a high binding affinity of an imine intermediate with ruthenium, as well as to a fast H/D exchange relative to ligand dissociation."
"The combination of Cu(acac)2 and N,N\xe2\x80\xb2-bis(4-hydroxyl-2,6-dimethylphenyl)oxalamide (BHMPO) provides a powerful catalytic system for hydroxylation of (hetero)aryl halides. A wide range of (hetero)aryl chlorides bearing either electron-donating or -withdrawing groups proceeded well at 130 \xc2\xb0C, delivering the corresponding phenols and hydroxylated heteroarenes in good to excellent yields. When more reactive (hetero)aryl bromides and iodides were employed, the hydroxylation reactions completed at relatively low temperatures (80 and 60 \xc2\xb0C, respectively) at low catalytic loadings (0.5 mol % Cu)."
"Fis protein is a nucleoid-associated protein that plays many roles in transcriptional regulation and DNA site-specific recombination. In contrast to the na\xc3\xafve expectation based on stoichiometry, recent single-molecule studies have shown that the dissociation of Fis protein from DNA is accelerated by increasing the concentration of the Fis protein. Because the detailed molecular mechanism of facilitated dissociation is still not clear, in this study, we employ computational methods to explore the binding landscapes of Fis:DNA complexes with various stoichiometries. When two Fis molecules are present, simulations uncover a ternary complex, where the originally bound Fis protein is partially dissociated from DNA. The simulations support a three-state sequential kinetic model (N \xe2\x87\x84 I \xe2\x86\x92 D) for facilitated dissociation, thus explaining the concentration-dependent dissociation."
"Under carbonylative conditions, neutral Rh(I)-systems modified with weak donor ligands (AsPh3 or 1,4-oxathiane) undergo N-Cbz, N-benzoyl, or N-Ts directed insertion into the proximal C\xe2\x80\x93C bond of aminomethylcyclopropanes to generate rhodacyclopentanone intermediates. These are trapped by N-tethered alkenes to provide complex perhydroisoindoles."
"Oxidative C\xe2\x80\x93H hydroxylation of methyl groups, followed by their removal from DNA, RNA, or histones, is an epigenetic process critical to transcriptional reprogramming and cell fate determination. This reaction is catalyzed by Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases using the essential metabolite 2-ketoglutarate (2KG) as a cofactor. Given that the human genome encodes for more than 60 2KG-dependent dioxygenases, assigning their individual functions remains a significant challenge. Here we describe a protein\xe2\x80\x93ligand interface engineering approach to break the biochemical degeneracy of these enzymes. Using histone lysine demethylase 4 as a proof-of-concept, we show that the enzyme active site can be expanded to employ bulky 2KG analogues that do not sensitize wild-type demethylases. We establish the orthogonality, substrate specificity, and catalytic competency of the engineered demethylation apparatus in biochemical assays. We further demonstrate demethylation of cognate substrates in physiologically relevant settings. Our results provide a paradigm for rapid and conditional manipulation of histone demethylases to uncloak their isoform-specific functions."
"Artificial photosynthesis relies on coupling light absorption with chemical fuel generation. A mechanistic study of visible light-driven H2 production from [Cp*Ir(bpy)H]+ (1) has revealed a new, highly efficient pathway for integrating light absorption with bond formation. The net reaction of 1 with a proton source produces H2, but the rate of excited state quenching is surprisingly acid-independent and displays no observable deuterium kinetic isotopic effect. Time-resolved photoluminescence and labeling studies are consistent with diffusion-limited bimetallic self-quenching by electron transfer. Accordingly, the quantum yield of H2 release nearly reaches unity as the concentration of 1 increases. This unique pathway for photochemical H2 generation provides insight into transformations catalyzed by 1."
"The application of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs) offers a promising new approach to synthesize designer functional materials with atomic precision. While ALD on flat substrates is well established, the complexity of the pore architecture and surface chemistry in MOFs present new challenges. Through in situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, we visualize how the deposited atoms are localized and redistribute within the MOF during ALD. We demonstrate that the ALD is regioselective, with preferential deposition of oxy-Zn(II) species within the small pores of NU-1000. Complementary density functional calculations indicate that this startling regioselectivity is driven by dispersion interactions associated with the preferential adsorption sites for the organometallic precursors prior to reaction."
"Self-assembly of a stereodynamic phosphine ligand, Pd(II), and a chiral amine, amino alcohol, or amino acid generates characteristic UV and CD signals that can be used for quantitative stereochemical analysis of the bound substrate. A robust mix-and-measure chiroptical sensing protocol has been developed and used to determine the absolute configuration, ee, and yield of an amine produced by Ir-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of an iminium salt. The analysis requires only 1 mg of the crude reaction mixture and minimizes cost, labor, time, and waste."
"The catalytic fixation of N2 by molecular Fe compounds is a rapidly developing field, yet thus far few complexes can effect this transformation, and none are selective for N2H4 production. Herein we report that the simple Fe(0) complex Fe(Et2PCH2CH2PEt2)2(N2) (1) is an efficient catalyst for the selective conversion of N2 (>25 molecules N2 fixed) into N2H4, attendant with the production of ca. one molecule of NH3. Notably, the reductant (CoCp*2) and acid (Ph2NH2OTf) used are considerably weaker than conventional chemical H+ and e\xe2\x80\x93 sources used in previous demonstrations of N2 turnover by synthetic Fe compounds. These results show that the direct catalytic conversion of N2 to the hydrazine oxidation state on molecular Fe complexes is viable and that the mechanism of NH3 formation by such systems may proceed via Fe\xe2\x80\x93N2H4 intermediates."
"We describe the rational design of a linked, bis-thiourea catalyst with enhanced activity relative to monomeric analogues in a representative enantioselective anion-abstraction reaction. Mechanistic insights guide development of this linking strategy to favor substrate activation though the intramolecular cooperation of two thiourea subunits while avoiding nonproductive aggregation. The resulting catalyst platform overcomes many of the practical limitations that have plagued hydrogen-bond-donor catalysis and enables use of catalyst loadings as low as 0.05 mol %. Computational analyses of possible anion-binding modes provide detailed insight into the precise mechanism of anion-abstraction catalysis with this pseudo-dimeric thiourea."
"Nature synthesizes many strained natural products that have diverse biological activities. Uncovering these biosynthetic pathways may lead to biomimetic strategies for organic synthesis of such compounds. In this work, we elucidated the concise biosynthetic pathway of herquline A, a highly strained and reduced fungal piperazine alkaloid. The pathway builds on a nonribosomal peptide synthetase derived dityrosine piperazine intermediate. Following enzymatic reduction of the P450-cross-linked dicyclohexadienone, N-methylation of the piperazine serves as a trigger that leads to a cascade of stereoselective and nonenzymatic transformations. Computational analysis of key steps in the pathway rationalizes the observed reactivities."
"Recoverin undergoes a calcium\xe2\x80\x93myristoyl switch during visual phototransduction. Indeed, calcium binding by recoverin results in the extrusion of its myristoyl group, which allows its membrane binding. However, the contribution of particular lipids and of specific amino acids of recoverin in its membrane binding has not yet been demonstrated. In the present work, the affinity of recoverin for the negatively charged phosphatidylserine has been clearly shown to be governed by a cluster of positively charged residues located in its N-terminal segment. Moreover, the calcium\xe2\x80\x93myristoyl switch of recoverin was only observed upon binding onto monolayers of phosphatidylserine and not in the case of other anionic phospholipids. Fluorescence microscopy experiments with mixed lipid monolayers allowed confirmation of the specific binding of myristoylated recoverin to phosphatidylserine, whereas the extent of penetration of recoverin in phosphatidylserine monolayers was estimated by ellipsometry. A model has thus been proposed for the membrane binding of myristoylated recoverin in the presence of calcium."
"Achieving multicolor photoluminescence, especially white-light emission, under mild conditions based on a single fluorescent compound is a great challenge. Herein, we report a novel colorful-emission host\xe2\x80\x93guest complex BPCY, which is composed of a two-arm fluorescent guest molecule (BPC) and \xce\xb3-cyclodextrin (\xce\xb3-CD) as the host molecule. BPC bears a unique asymmetrical donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor\xe2\x80\x93donor (D1-A+\xe2\x88\xbcD2)-type structure, where D1, A+, and D2 stand for the binaphthol electron donor, pyridinium electron acceptor, and coumarin electron donor, respectively. The luminescence property of BPC shows dual-sensitivity, i.e., toward the excitation wavelength and the cyclodextrin host molecule. Under certain conditions, the complex shows three different emission wavelengths, allowing the realization of multicolor photoluminescence, including red (R), green (G), and blue (B) as well as various intermediate colors by orthogonally modulating these two stimuli. In this way, nearly pure white-light emission with CIE coordinates (0.33, 0.34) could be generated. A combination of structural, spectroscopic, and computational simulation studies revealed the occurrence of synergetic mechanistic processes for the stimuli-responsive multicolor luminescence of the BPCY complex, namely, host-enhanced intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) and host-induced restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR). This new supramolecular complex with superior multicolor emission abilities may find wide applications in the fields of information processing and display media. Furthermore, the molecular design rationale presented here may provide a new design strategy for the development of high performance optical materials using a single supramolecular platform."
"Recently developed all-organic emitters used in display applications achieve high brightness by harvesting triplet populations via thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The photophysical properties of these emitters therefore involve new inherent complexities and are strongly affected by interactions with their host material in the solid state. Ensemble measurements occlude the molecular details of how host\xe2\x80\x93guest interactions determine fundamental properties such as the essential balance of singlet oscillator strength and triplet harvesting. Therefore, using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, we interrogate these emitters at the single-molecule level and compare their properties in two distinct glassy polymer hosts. We find that nonbonding interactions with aromatic moieties in the host appear to mediate the molecular configurations of the emitters, but also promote nonradiative quenching pathways. We also find substantial heterogeneity in the time-resolved photoluminescence of these emitters, which is dominated by static disorder in the polymer. Finally, since singlet\xe2\x80\x93triplet cycling underpins the mechanism for increased brightness, we present the first room-temperature measurement of singlet\xe2\x80\x93triplet equilibration dynamics in this family of emitters. Our observations present a molecular-scale interrogation of host\xe2\x80\x93guest interactions in a disordered film, with implications for highly efficient organic light-emitting devices. Combining a single-molecule experimental technique with an emitter that is sensitive to triplet dynamics, yet read out via fluorescence, should also provide a complementary approach to performing fundamental studies of glassy materials over a large dynamic range of time scales."
"Controlling mechanical properties of ordered organic materials remains a formidable challenge, despite their great potential for high performance mechanical actuators, transistors, solar cells, photonics, and bioelectronics. Here we demonstrate a crystal engineering approach to design mechanically reconfigurable, plastically flexible single crystals (of about 10) of three unrelated types of compounds by introducing active slip planes in structures via different noninterfering supramolecular weak interactions, namely van der Waals (vdW), \xcf\x80-stacking, and hydrogen bonding groups. Spherical hydrophobic groups, which assemble via shape complementarity (shape synthons), reliably form low energy slip planes, thus facilitating an impressive mechanical flexibility, which allowed molding the crystals into alphabetical characters to spell out \xe2\x80\x9co r g a n i c c r y s t a l\xe2\x80\x9d. The study, which reports the preparation of a series of exotic plastic crystals by design for the first time, demonstrates the potential of soft interactions for tuning the mechanical behavior of ordered molecular materials, including those from \xcf\x80-conjugated systems."
"A series of photoactive triads have been synthesized and investigated in order to elucidate photoinduced electron transfer and hole migration mechanism across nanosized, rigid helical foldamers. The triads are comprised of a central helical oligoamide foldamer bridge with 9, 14, 18, 19, or 34 8-amino-2-quinolinecarboxylic acid repeat units, and of two chromophores, an N-terminal oligo(para-phenylenevinylene) electron donor and a C-terminal perylene bis-imide electron acceptor. Time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopic studies showed that, following photoexcitation of the electron acceptor, fast electron transfer occurs initially from the oligoquinoline bridge to the acceptor chromophore on the picosecond time scale. The oligo(para-phenylenevinylene) electron donor is oxidized after a time delay during which the hole migrates across the foldamer from the acceptor to the donor. The charge separated state that is finally generated was found to be remarkably long-lived (>80 \xce\xbcs). While the initial charge injection rate is largely invariant for all foldamer lengths (ca. 60 ps), the subsequent hole transfer to the donor varies from 1 \xc3\x97 109 s\xe2\x80\x931 for the longest sequence to 17 \xc3\x97 109 s\xe2\x80\x931 for the shortest. In all cases, charge transfer is very fast considering the foldamer length. Detailed analysis of the process in different media and at varying temperatures is consistent with a hopping mechanism of hole transport through the foldamer helix, with individual hops occurring on the subpicosecond time scale (kET = 2.5 \xc3\x97 1012 s\xe2\x80\x931 in CH2Cl2). This work demonstrates the possibility of fast long-range hole transfer over 300 \xc3\x85 (through bonds) across a synthetic modular bridge, an achievement that had been previously observed principally with DNA structures."
"Current tile-based DNA self-assembly produces simple repetitive or highly symmetric structures. In the case of 2D lattices, the unit cell often contains only one basic tile because the tiles often are symmetric (in terms of either the backbone or the sequence). In this work, we have applied retrosynthetic analysis to determine the minimal asymmetric units for complex DNA nanostructures. Such analysis guides us to break the intrinsic structural symmetries of the tiles to achieve high structural complexities. This strategy has led to the construction of several DNA nanostructures that are not accessible from conventional symmetric tile designs. Along with previous studies, herein we have established a set of four fundamental rules regarding tile-based assembly. Such rules could serve as guidelines for the design of DNA nanostructures."
"Visualizing proton-transfer processes at the nanoscale is essential for understanding the reactivity of zeolite-based catalyst materials. In this work, the Br\xc3\xb8nsted-acid-catalyzed oligomerization of styrene derivatives was used for the first time as a single molecule probe reaction to study the reactivity of individual zeolite H-ZSM-5 crystals in different zeolite framework, reactant and solvent environments. This was accomplished via the formation of distinct dimeric and trimeric fluorescent carbocations, characterized by their different photostability, as detected by single molecule fluorescence microscopy. The oligomerization kinetics turned out to be very sensitive to the reaction conditions and the presence of the local structural defects in zeolite H-ZSM-5 crystals. The remarkably photostable trimeric carbocations were found to be formed predominantly near defect-rich crystalline regions. This spectroscopic marker offers clear prospects for nanoscale quality control of zeolite-based materials. Interestingly, replacing n-heptane with 1-butanol as a solvent led to a reactivity decrease of several orders and shorter survival times of fluorescent products due to the strong chemisorption of 1-butanol onto the Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid sites. A similar effect was achieved by changing the electrophilic character of the para-substituent of the styrene moiety. Based on the measured turnover rates we have established a quantitative, single turnover approach to evaluate substituent and solvent effects on the reactivity of individual zeolite H-ZSM-5 crystals."
"The rotational speed of an overcrowded alkene-based molecular rotary motor, having an integrated 4,5-diazafluorenyl coordination motif, can be regulated allosterically via the binding of metal ions. DFT calculations have been used to predict the relative speed of rotation of three different (i.e., zinc, palladium, and platinum) metal dichloride complexes. The photochemical and thermal isomerization behavior of these complexes has been studied in detail using UV\xe2\x80\x93vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Our results confirm that metal coordination induces a contraction of the diazafluorenyl lower half, resulting in a reduction of the steric hindrance in the \xe2\x80\x9cfjord\xe2\x80\x9d region of the molecule, which causes an increase of the rotational speed. Importantly, metal complexation can be accomplished in situ and is found to be reversible upon the addition of a competing ligand. Consequently, the rotational behavior of these molecular motors can be dynamically controlled with chemical additives."
"The simple solution processability at room temperature exposes lead halide perovskite semiconductors to a non-negligible level of unintentional structural and chemical defects. Ascertained that their primary optoelectronic properties meet the requirement for high efficiency optoelectronic technologies, a lack of knowledge about the nature of defects and their role in the device operation currently is a major challenge for their market-scale application due to the issues with stability and reliability. Here, we use excitation correlation photoluminescence (ECPL) spectroscopy to investigate the recombination dynamics of the photogenerated carriers in lead bromide perovskites and quantitatively describe the carrier trapping dynamics within a generalization of the Shockley\xe2\x80\x93Read\xe2\x80\x93Hall formalism. The superior sensitivity of our spectroscopic tool to the many-body interactions enables us to identify the energetics of the defects. In fact, in the case of polycrystalline films, depending on the synthetic route, we demonstrate the presence of both deep and shallow carrier traps. The shallow defects, which are situated at about 20 meV below the conduction band, dope the semiconductor, leading to a substantial enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield despite carrier trapping. At excitation densities relevant for lasing, we observe breakdown of the rate-equation model, indicating a buildup of a highly correlated regime of the photocarrier population that suppresses the nonradiative Auger recombination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that colloidal nanocrystals represent virtually defect-free systems, suffering from nonradiative quenching only due to subpicosecond Auger-like interactions at high excitation density. By correlating the fabrication conditions to the nonradiative loss channels, this work provides guidelines for material engineering towards superior optoelectronic devices."
"FeFe hydrogenases catalyze H2 oxidation and formation at an inorganic active site (the \xe2\x80\x9cH-cluster\xe2\x80\x9d), which consists of a [Fe2(CO)3(CN)2(dithiomethylamine)] subcluster covalently attached to a Fe4S4 subcluster. This active site is photosensitive: visible light has been shown to induce the release of exogenous CO (a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme), shuffle the intrinsic CO ligands, and even destroy the H-cluster. These reactions must be understood because they may negatively impact the use of hydrogenase for the photoproduction of H2. Here, we explore in great detail the reactivity of the excited states of the H-cluster under catalytic conditions by examining, both experimentally and using TDDFT calculations, the simplest photochemical reaction: the binding and release of exogenous CO. A simple dyad model can be used to predict which excitations are active. This strategy could be used for probing other aspects of the photoreactivity of the H-cluster."
"The green fluorescent protein and its designed variants fluoresce efficiently. Because the isolated chromophore is not fluorescent in a practical sense, it is apparent that the protein environment plays a crucial role in its efficiency. Because of various obstacles in studying excited state dynamics of complex systems, however, the detailed mechanism of this efficiency enhancement is not yet clearly elucidated. Here, by adopting excited state nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations together with an interpolated quantum chemical potential model of the chromophore, we find that the strong electric field from the protein matrix contributes dominantly to the motional restriction of the chromophore. The delay in twisting motion subsequently obstructs the nonradiative decay that competes with fluorescence, leading naturally to an enhancement in light-emitting efficiency. Surprisingly, steric constraints make only a minor contribution to these aspects. Through residue specific analyses, we identify a group of key residues that control the excited state behavior. Testing a series of mutant GFPs with different brightnesses also supports the view regarding the importance of protein electrostatics. Our findings may provide a useful guide toward designing new fluorescent chemical systems in the future."
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by targeting protein-coding transcripts that are involved in various cellular processes. Thus, miRNA biogenesis has been recognized as a novel therapeutic target. Especially, the let-7 miRNA family is well-known for its tumor suppressor functions and is downregulated in many cancer cells. Lin28 protein binds to let-7 miRNA precursors to inhibit their maturation. Herein, we developed a FRET-based, high-throughput screening system to identify small-molecule inhibitors of the Lin28\xe2\x80\x93let-7 interaction. We employed unnatural amino acid mutagenesis and bioorthogonal chemistry for the site-specific fluorescent labeling of Lin28, which ensures the robustness and reliability of the FRET-based protein\xe2\x80\x93miRNA binding assay. Using this direct binding assay, we identified an inhibitor of the oncogenic Lin28\xe2\x80\x93let-7 interaction. The inhibitor enhanced the production of let-7 miRNAs in Lin28-expressing cancer cells and reduced the level of let-7 target oncogene products."
"Conventional water electrolyzers produce H2 and O2 simultaneously, such that additional gas separation steps are needed to prevent H2/O2 mixing. The sluggish anodic O2 evolution reaction (OER) always results in low overall energy conversion efficiency and the product of OER, O2, is not of significant value. In addition, the potential formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may lead to degradation of cell membranes and thus premature device failure. Herein we report a general concept of integrating oxidative biomass upgrading reactions with decoupled H2 generation from water splitting. Five representative biomass substrates, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, furfural, furfuryl alcohol, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), were selected for oxidative upgrading catalyzed by a hierarchically porous Ni3S2/Ni foam bifunctional electrocatalyst (Ni3S2/NF). All the five organics can be oxidized to value-added liquid products at much lower overpotentials than that of OER. In particular, the electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF to the value-added 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) was further studied in detail. Benefiting from the more favorable thermodynamics of HMF oxidation than that of OER, the cell voltage for integrated H2 production and HMF oxidation was significantly reduced by \xe2\x88\xbc200 mV relative to pure water splitting to achieve 100 mA cm\xe2\x80\x932, while the oxidation product (FDCA) at the anode was much more valuable than O2. When utilized as electrocatalysts for both cathode and anode, Ni3S2/NF demonstrated outstanding durability and nearly unity Faradaic efficiencies for both H2 and FDCA production. Overall, such an integration of oxidative biomass valorization and HER via earth-abundant electrocatalysts not only avoids the generation of explosive H2/O2 mixture and ROS, but also yields products of high value at both electrodes with lower voltage input, maximizing the energy conversion efficiency."
"Solid-state thermoelectric technology, interconverting heat to electrical energy, offers a promising solution for relaxing global energy problems. A high dimensionless figure of merit ZT is desirable for high-efficiency thermoelectric power generation. To date, thermoelectric materials research has focused on increasing the material\xe2\x80\x99s ZT. Here we first fabricated phase-separated Sn1\xe2\x80\x93xPbxSe materials by hydrothermal synthesis. We demonstrate that the simultaneous optimization of the power factor and significant reduction in thermal conductivity can be achieved in the phase-separated Sn1\xe2\x80\x93xPbxSe material. The introduction of the PbSe phase contributes to improvement of the electrical conductivity and power factor of the SnSe phase. Meanwhile, nanoscale precipitates and mesoscale grains define all-scale hierarchical architectures to scattering phonons, leading to low lattice thermal conductivity. These two favorable factors lead to remarkably high thermoelectric performance with ZT \xe2\x88\xbc 1.7 at 873 K in polycrystalline SnSe + 1% PbSe along the pressing direction, which is a record-high ZT for SnSe polycrystals. These findings highlight the prospects of realizing highly effective solid-state thermoelectric devices."
"Chiral nanoparticle assemblies are an interesting class of materials whose chiroptical properties make them attractive for a variety of applications. Here, C18-(PEPAuM-ox)2 (PEPAuM-ox = AYSSGAPPMoxPPF) is shown to direct the assembly of single-helical gold nanoparticle superstructures that exhibit exceptionally strong chiroptical activity at the plasmon frequency with absolute g-factor values up to 0.04. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) results indicate that the single helices have a periodic pitch of approximately 100 nm and consist of oblong gold nanoparticles. The morphology and assembled structure of C18-(PEPAuM-ox)2 are studied using TEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. TEM and AFM reveal that C18-(PEPAuM-ox)2 assembles into linear amyloid-like 1D helical ribbons having structural parameters that correlate to those of the single-helical gold nanoparticle superstructures. FTIR, CD, XRD, and ssNMR indicate the presence of cross-\xce\xb2 and polyproline II secondary structures. A molecular assembly model is presented that takes into account all experimental observations and that supports the single-helical nanoparticle assembly architecture. This model provides the basis for the design of future nanoparticle assemblies having programmable structures and properties."
"The photoanodes with heterojunction behavior could enable the development of solar energy conversion, but their performance largely suffers from the poor charge separation and transport process through the multiple interfacial energy levels involved. The question is how to efficiently manipulate these energy levels. Taking the n-Si Schottky photoanode as a prototype, the undesired donor-like interfacial defects and its adverse effects on charge transfer in n-Si/ITO photoanode are well recognized and diminished through the treatment on electronic energy level. The obtained n-Si/TiOx/ITO Schottky junction exhibits a highly efficient charge transport and a barrier height of 0.95 eV, which is close to the theoretical optimum for n-Si/ITO Schottky contact. Then, the holes extraction can be further facilitated through the variation of surface energy level, with the NiOOH coated ITO layer. This is confirmed by a 115% increase in surface photovoltage of the photoanodes. Eventually, an unprecedentedly low onset potential of 0.9 V (vs RHE) is realized for water oxidation among n-Si photoanodes. For the water oxidation reaction, the n-Si/TiOx/ITO/NiOOH photoanode presents a charge separation efficiency up to 100% and an injection efficiency greater than 90% at a wide voltage range. This work identifies the important role of interfacial energetics played in photoelectrochemical conversion."
"Activation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is necessary for limitless replication in tumorigenesis. Whereas hTERT is transcriptionally silenced in normal cells, most tumor cells reactivate hTERT expression by alleviating transcriptional repression through diverse genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Transcription-activating hTERT promoter mutations have been found to occur at high frequencies in multiple cancer types. These mutations have been shown to form new transcription factor binding sites that drive hTERT expression, but this model cannot fully account for differences in wild-type (WT) and mutant promoter activation and has not yet enabled a selective therapeutic strategy. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which promoter mutations activate hTERT transcription, which also sheds light on a unique therapeutic opportunity. Promoter mutations occur in a core promoter region that forms tertiary structures consisting of a pair of G-quadruplexes involved in transcriptional silencing. We show that promoter mutations exert a detrimental effect on the folding of one of these G-quadruplexes, resulting in a nonfunctional silencer element that alleviates transcriptional repression. We have also identified a small drug-like pharmacological chaperone (pharmacoperone) molecule, GTC365, that acts at an early step in the G-quadruplex folding pathway to redirect mutant promoter G-quadruplex misfolding, partially reinstate the correct folding pathway, and reduce hTERT activity through transcriptional repression. This transcription-mediated repression produces cancer cell death through multiple routes including both induction of apoptosis through inhibition of hTERT\xe2\x80\x99s role in regulating apoptosis-related proteins and induction of senescence by decreasing telomerase activity and telomere length. We demonstrate the selective therapeutic potential of this strategy in melanoma cells that overexpress hTERT."
"\xe2\x80\x9cHeavy\xe2\x80\x9d (isotopically labeled) enzyme isotope effects offer a direct experimental probe of the role of protein vibrations on enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Here we have developed a strategy to generate isotopologues of the flavoenzyme pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase (PETNR) where the protein and/or intrinsic flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor are isotopically labeled with 2H, 15N, and 13C. Both the protein and cofactor contribute to the enzyme isotope effect on the reductive hydride transfer reaction, but their contributions are not additive and may partially cancel each other out. However, the isotope effect specifically arising from the FMN suggests that vibrations local to the active site play a role in the hydride transfer chemistry, while the protein-only \xe2\x80\x9cheavy enzyme\xe2\x80\x9d effect demonstrates that protein vibrations contribute to catalysis in PETNR. In all cases, enthalpy\xe2\x80\x93entropy compensation plays a major role in minimizing the magnitude of \xe2\x80\x9cheavy enzyme\xe2\x80\x9d isotope effects. Fluorescence lifetime measurements of the intrinsic flavin mononucleotide show marked differences between \xe2\x80\x9clight\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cheavy\xe2\x80\x9d enzymes on the nanosecond\xe2\x80\x93picosecond time scale, suggesting relevant time scale(s) for those vibrations implicated in the \xe2\x80\x9cheavy enzyme\xe2\x80\x9d isotope effect on the PETNR reaction."
"The reactivity of a CoI\xe2\x80\x93H2 complex was extended toward the semihydrogenation of internal alkynes. Under ambient temperatures and moderate pressures of H2, a broad scope of alkynes were semihydrogenated using a CoI-N2 precatalyst, resulting in the formation of trans-alkene products. Furthermore, mechanistic studies using 1H, 2H, and para-hydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) transfer NMR spectroscopy revealed cis-hydrogenation of the alkyne occurs first. The Co-mediated alkene isomerization afforded the E-selective products from a broad group of alkynes with good yields and E/Z selectivity."
"Escherichia coli class Ia ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) converts ribonucleotides to deoxynucleotides. A diferric-tyrosyl radical (Y122\xe2\x80\xa2) in one subunit (\xce\xb22) generates a transient thiyl radical in another subunit (\xce\xb12) via long-range radical transport (RT) through aromatic amino acid residues (Y122 \xe2\x87\x86 [W48] \xe2\x87\x86 Y356 in \xce\xb22 to Y731 \xe2\x87\x86 Y730 \xe2\x87\x86 C439 in \xce\xb12). Equilibration of Y356\xe2\x80\xa2, Y731\xe2\x80\xa2, and Y730\xe2\x80\xa2 was recently observed using site specifically incorporated unnatural tyrosine analogs; however, equilibration between Y122\xe2\x80\xa2 and Y356\xe2\x80\xa2 has not been detected. Our recent report of Y356\xe2\x80\xa2 formation in a kinetically and chemically competent fashion in the reaction of \xce\xb22 containing 2,3,5-trifluorotyrosine at Y122 (F3Y122\xe2\x80\xa2-\xce\xb22) with \xce\xb12, CDP (substrate), and ATP (effector) has now afforded the opportunity to investigate equilibration of F3Y122\xe2\x80\xa2 and Y356\xe2\x80\xa2. Incubation of F3Y122\xe2\x80\xa2-\xce\xb22, Y731F-\xce\xb12 (or Y730F-\xce\xb12), CDP, and ATP at different temperatures (2\xe2\x80\x9337 \xc2\xb0C) provides \xce\x94E\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\xb2(F3Y122\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x93Y356\xe2\x80\xa2) of 20 \xc2\xb1 10 mV at 25 \xc2\xb0C. The pH dependence of the F3Y122\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x87\x86 Y356\xe2\x80\xa2 interconversion (pH 6.8\xe2\x80\x938.0) reveals that the proton from Y356 is in rapid exchange with solvent, in contrast to the proton from Y122. Insertion of 3,5-difluorotyrosine (F2Y) at Y356 and rapid freeze-quench EPR analysis of its reaction with Y731F-\xce\xb12, CDP, and ATP at pH 8.2 and 25 \xc2\xb0C shows F2Y356\xe2\x80\xa2 generation by the native Y122\xe2\x80\xa2. FnY-RNRs (n = 2 and 3) together provide a model for the thermodynamic landscape of the RT pathway in which the reaction between Y122 and C439 is \xe2\x88\xbc200 meV uphill."
"Copper sulfide nanocrystals support localized surface plasmon resonances in the near-infrared wavelengths and have significant potential as active plasmonic nanomaterials due to the tunability of this optical response. While numerous strategies exist for synthesizing copper sulfide nanocrystals, few methods result in nanocrystals with both controlled morphological shapes and crystallinity. Here, we synthesize and characterize ultrathin (<5 nm) Cu9S5 nanosheets that are formed by solventless thermolysis, utilizing Cu alkanethiolates as single-source precursors. Layered Cu alkanethiolate precursors adopt a highly ordered structure which can be further stabilized in the presence of Cl\xe2\x80\x93 and also serve to template the formation of nanosheets. We show that, in the absence of Cl\xe2\x80\x93, only isotropic and disk-like Cu2\xe2\x80\x93xS nanocrystals form. These findings offer further insight into the use of layered metal\xe2\x80\x93organic single-source precursors as templates for anisotropic nanocrystal growth."
"Crystalline and amorphous molybdenum sulfide (Mo\xe2\x80\x93S) catalysts are leaders as earth-abundant materials for electrocatalytic hydrogen production. The development of a molecular motif inspired by the Mo\xe2\x80\x93S catalytic materials and their active sites is of interest, as molecular species possess a great degree of tunable electronic properties. Furthermore, these molecular mimics may be important for providing mechanistic insights toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with Mo\xe2\x80\x93S electrocatalysts. Herein is presented two water-soluble Mo\xe2\x80\x93S complexes based around the [MoO(S2)2L2]1\xe2\x80\x93 motif. We present 1H NMR spectra that reveal (NEt4)[MoO(S2)2picolinate] (Mo-pic) is stable in a d6-DMSO solution after heating at 100 \xc2\xb0C, in air, revealing unprecedented thermal and aerobic stability of the homogeneous electrocatalyst. Both Mo-pic and (NEt4)[MoO(S2)2pyrimidine-2-carboxylate] (Mo-pym) are shown to be homogeneous electrocatalysts for the HER. The TOF of 27\xe2\x80\x9334 s\xe2\x80\x931 and 42\xe2\x80\x9348 s\xe2\x80\x931 for Mo-pic and Mo-pym and onset potentials of 240 mV and 175 mV for Mo-pic and Mo-pym, respectively, reveal these complexes as promising electrocatalysts for the HER."
"New tetranuclear supramolecular precursors [(R\xe2\x80\x94C\xe2\x89\xa1C\xe2\x80\x94C\xe2\x89\xa1C)Ag]4 (R = iPr, tBu, and chx) are employed to construct a series of heterometallic silver(I)\xe2\x80\x93copper(I) alkyl-1,3-diynyl cluster complexes (1\xe2\x80\x939) that bear a common CuAg3 core (normally trigonal-planar, but can be distorted to pyramidal) consolidated by cupro-argentophilic interaction under 3.12 \xc3\x85, as found in 1 and 2. The photophysical properties of the multinuclear supramolecular precursors and selected complexes have been investigated. The present results strongly suggest that the assembly of medium-nuclearity clusters 3 to 9 is initiated by accretion of additional Ag(I) ions by the ubiquitous CuAg3 template through argentophilic (<3.4 \xc3\x85) interaction, with cooperative cuprophilic enhancement (<2.76 \xc3\x85) in the case of compound 9. To our knowledge, the present study provides the first report of conversion of a Group 11 homonuclear cluster into a heteronuclear one of higher nuclearity via inner-core expansion."
"Photogenerated charge carrier dynamics near molecule/TiO2 interfaces are important for the photocatalytic and photovoltaic processes. To understand this fundamental aspect, we performed a time-domain ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics study of the photogenerated hole dynamics at the CH3OH/rutile TiO2(110) interface. We studied the forward and reverse hole transfer between TiO2 and CH3OH as well as the hole energy relaxation to the valence band maximum. First, we show that the hole-trapping ability of CH3OH depends strongly on the adsorption structure. Only when the CH3OH is deprotonated to form chemisorbed CH3O will \xe2\x88\xbc15% of the hole be trapped by the molecule. Second, we find that strong fluctuations of the HOMO energies of the adsorbed molecules induced by electron\xe2\x80\x93phonon coupling provide additional channels, which accelerate the hole energy relaxation. Third, we demonstrate that the charge transfer and energy relaxation processes depend significantly on temperature. When the temperature decreases from 100 to 30 K, the forward hole transfer and energy relaxation processes are strongly suppressed because of the reduction of phonon occupation. These results indicate that the molecule/TiO2 energy level alignment, thermal excitation of a phonon, and electron\xe2\x80\x93phonon coupling are the key factors that determine the photogenerated hole dynamics. Our studies provide valuable insights into the photogenerated charge and energy transfer dynamics at molecule/semiconductor interfaces."
"Due to the inherent difficulties in achieving a defined and exclusive formation of multicomponent assemblies against entropic predisposition, we present the rational assembly of a heteroleptic [Pd2LA2LB2]4+ coordination cage achieved through the geometric complementarity of two carefully designed ligands, LA and LB. With Pd(II) cations as rigid nodes, the pure distinctly angular components readily form homoleptic cages, a [Pd2LA4]4+ strained helical assembly and a [Pd4LB8]8+ box-like structure, both of which were characterized by X-ray analysis. Combined, however, the two ligands could be used to cleanly assemble a cis-[Pd2LA2LB2]4+ cage with a bent architecture. The same self-sorted product was also obtained by a quantitative cage-to-cage transformation upon mixing of the two homoleptic cages revealing the [Pd2LA2LB2]4+ assembly as the thermodynamic minimum. The structure of the heteroleptic cage was examined by ESI-MS, COSY, DOSY, and NOESY methods, the latter of which pointed toward a cis-conformation of ligands in the assembly. Indeed, DFT calculations revealed that the angular ligands and strict Pd(II) geometry strongly favor the cis-[Pd2LA2LB2]4+ species. The robust nature of the cis-[Pd2LA2LB2]4+ cage allowed us to probe the accessibility of its cavity, which could be utilized for shape recognition toward stereoisomeric guests. The ability to directly combine two different backbones in a controlled manner provides a powerful strategy for increasing complexity in the family of [Pd2L4] cages and opens up possibilities of introducing multiple functionalities into a single self-assembled architecture."
"A rare Co\xe2\x88\x92N\xe2\x88\x92C three-membered ring has been formed by a novel pathway involving a facile interligand nucleophilic addition of an equatorial nitrogen donor to a ligated axial carbon in some organocobalt complexes. The highly distorted structure of a typical resulting complex provides clear experimental evidence useful in assessing hypotheses and computations concerning Co\xe2\x88\x92C bond activation in B12 chemistry. Treatment of R = \xe2\x88\x92CH2X (X = halogen) derivatives of imine/oxime B12 models of the type [LCo((DO)(DOH)pn)R]+ with base afforded major products with striking NMR spectral features in common, e.g., two one-proton olefinic doublets (J \xe2\x89\x88 3 Hz) and two one-proton singlets. The X-ray structure for the pyridine (py) derivative [pyCo(N-CH2-CHEL)]+ (1) reveals two unexpected features:\xe2\x80\x89 a three-membered metallocycle containing an \xce\xb72-aminomethylene group, and an enamine (N\xe2\x88\x92CCH2) in place of one imine moiety (NC\xe2\x88\x92CH3). The C\xe2\x88\x92Co\xe2\x88\x92N ring angle is acute (43.7\xc2\xb0) with the distortion of the coordination sphere concentrated in the Co\xe2\x88\x92C and the Co\xe2\x88\x92N ring linkages, which move away from the normal pseudooctahedral positions. Studies of the formation of the aqua analog of 1, [H2OCo(N-CH2-CHEL)]+ (3), in aqueous solution suggest that the initial intermediate formed is deprotonated at one imine methyl. Ring closure in the short-lived deprotonated intermediate is facile. Published calculations predict that such ring closure could occur and that, of two processes which could facilitate Co\xe2\x88\x92C bond cleavage (\xce\xb8-bending of the N\xe2\x88\x92Co\xe2\x88\x92C angle and \xcf\x86-bending of the Co\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92C angle), the latter factor should be more significant in weakening the Co\xe2\x88\x92C bond. There is large \xce\xb8-bending in 1; thus, the new metallocyclic B12 analogs afford the first experimental test of these calculations. Our findings that the Co\xe2\x88\x92C bond in 1 is short and that the bond did not readily cleave support the predictions of the calculations. "
A new curved polycyclic aromatic compound with an unprecedented wizard hat shape could be useful in the synthesis of extended cone-shaped nanographenes.
"Conventional organic synthesis has been mainly based upon the reactivities of \xcf\x80-bonds and polar \xcf\x83-bonds. Carbon\xe2\x80\x93carbon single bonds are nonpolar and generally far less reactive. Although they remain intact under most reaction conditions, it is possible to activate and cleave them if suitable organometallic compounds or metal catalysts are applied. Such C\xe2\x80\x93C single bond cleavage reactions are attracting increasing attention in the context of synthetic chemistry because they provide a unique and more straightforward route from readily available substances to targets, while requiring significantly fewer steps. The present Perspective aims to exemplify the potential of metal-catalyzed C\xe2\x80\x93C single bond cleavage for organic synthesis."
"Thiols and phosphines are the most widely used organic ligands to attain atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs). Here, we used simple hydrides (e.g., H\xe2\x80\x93) as ligands along with phosphines, such as triphenylphosphine (TPP), 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane [DPPE], and tris(4-fluorophenyl)phosphine [TFPP] to design and synthesize a new class of hydride-rich silver NCs. This class includes [Ag18H16(TPP)10]2+, [Ag25H22(DPPE)8]3+, and [Ag26H22(TFPP)13]2+. Our work reveals a new family of atomically precise NCs protected by H\xe2\x80\x93 ligands and labile phosphines, with potentially more accessible active metal sites for functionalization and provides a new set of stable NC sizes with simpler ligand\xe2\x80\x93metal bonding for researchers to explore both experimentally and computationally."
"Deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) remove ubiquitin (Ub) from various cellular proteins and render eukaryotic ubiquitylation a dynamic process. The misregulation of protein ubiquitylation is associated with many human diseases, and there is an urgent need to identify specific DUBs associated with therapeutically relevant targets of Ub. We report the development of two facile selenocysteine-based strategies to generate the DUB probe dehydroalanine (Dha). Optimized oxidative or alkylative elimination of Se yielded Dha at the C-terminus of Ub. The high utility of alkylative elimination, which is compatible with multiple thiols in Ub targets, was demonstrated by generating a probe derived from the Ub ligase tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM-25). Successful capture of the TRIM-25-associated DUB, ubiquitin-specific protease 15, demonstrated the versatility of our chemical strategy for identifying target-specific DUBs."
"A nonplanar polycyclic aromatic compound 6 bearing a tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) core merged with an o,p,o,p,o,p-hexaphenylene belt was prepared and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The key synthesis step involves three Scholl-type cycloheptatriene ring formation steps of the 1,4,8-tris(3\xe2\x80\xb2,4\xe2\x80\xb2-dimethoxyphenyl)-TBTQ derivative 5. The bridging of each of the three TBTQ bays by 1,2-phenylene units in compound 6 gives rise to an unusual wizard hat shaped structure, which represents a promising key intermediate for the construction of nonplanar nanographene molecules bearing a TBTQ core."
"The motion of self-propelled tubular micro- and nanojets has so far been achieved by bubble propulsion, e.g., O2 bubbles formed by catalytic decomposition of H2O2, which renders future biomedical applications inviable. An alternative self-propulsion mechanism for tubular engines on the nanometer scale is still missing. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of bubble-free propelled tubular nanojets (as small as 220 nm diameter), powered by an enzyme-triggered biocatalytic reaction using urea as fuel. We studied the translational and rotational dynamics of the nanojets as functions of the length and location of the enzymes. Introducing tracer nanoparticles into the system, we demonstrated the presence of an internal flow that extends into the external fluid via the cavity opening, leading to the self-propulsion. One-dimensional nanosize, longitudinal self-propulsion, and biocompatibility make the tubular nanojets promising for future biomedical applications."
"Through use of in situ Raman spectroscopy and single-crystal/powder X-ray diffraction, we resolve the \xe2\x80\x9cC0\xe2\x80\x9d phase structure discovered recently in the H2 + H2O system. This phase forms at \xe2\x88\xbc400 MPa and 280 K with the nominal composition (H2O)2H2 and three formula units per unit cell. The hexagonal structure is chiral, consisting of interpenetrating spiral chains of hydrogen-bonded water molecules and rotationally disordered H2 molecules, and shows topological similarities with the mineral quartz. Like other clathrate hydrates and forms of ice, the protons of H2O molecules within C0 are disordered. The large zeolite-like channels accommodate significant amounts of hydrogen (5.3% by weight) in a unique hydrogen-bonded lattice, which might be applicable to the thermodynamic conditions found on icy planetary bodies."
"The underlying reactivity of AuIII\xe2\x80\x93F species with aryl boronic acids has been studied in detail taking advantage of four novel, stable difluoro-[(C^N)AuF2], arylmonofluoro-[(C^N)AuArF], and alkylmonofluoro-[(C^N)AuAlkF] gold(III) complexes, prepared and isolated in monomeric form. We provide the first experimental evidence for a direct AuIII\xe2\x80\x93F/B transmetalation preceding the Csp2\xe2\x80\x93Csp2 or Csp3\xe2\x80\x93Csp2 bond formation."
"Preparation of a range of enantioenriched \xce\xb2-fluoro amines (\xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-disubstituted) is described in which the nitrogen and fluorine atoms are attached to sp3-hybridized carbons. The key finding is a chiral bifunctional Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid/base catalyst that can deliver \xce\xb2-amino-\xce\xb1-fluoro nitroalkanes with high enantio- and diastereoselection. A denitration step renders the nitro group \xe2\x80\x9ctraceless\xe2\x80\x9d and delivers secondary, tertiary, or vinyl alkyl fluorides embedded within a vicinal fluoro amine functional group. A synthesis of each possible stereoisomer of a \xce\xb2-fluoro lanicemine illustrates the potential ease with which fluorinated small molecules relevant to neuroscience drug development can be prepared in a stereochemically comprehensive manner."
"Quantum and dielectric confinement effects in Ruddlesden-Popper 2D hybrid perovskites create excitons with a binding energy exceeding 150 meV. We exploit the large exciton binding energy to study exciton and carrier dynamics as well as electron\xe2\x80\x93phonon coupling (EPC) in hybrid perovskites using absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies. At temperatures <75 K, we resolve splitting of the excitonic absorption and PL into multiple regularly spaced resonances every 40\xe2\x80\x9346 meV, consistent with EPC to phonons located on the organic cation. We also resolve resonances with a 14 meV spacing, in accord with coupling to phonons with mixed organic and inorganic character. These assignments are supported by density-functional theory calculations. Hot exciton PL and time-resolved PL measurements show that vibrational relaxation occurs on a picosecond time scale competitive with that for PL. At temperatures >75 K, excitonic absorption and PL exhibit homogeneous broadening. While absorption remains homogeneous, PL becomes inhomogeneous at temperatures <75K, which we speculate is caused by the formation and subsequent dynamics of a polaronic exciton."
"Copper is the only elemental metal that reduces a significant fraction of CO2 to hydrocarbons and alcohols, but the atomistic reaction mechanism that controls the product distributions is not known because it has not been possible to detect the reaction intermediates on the electrode surface experimentally, or to carry out Quantum Mechanics (QM) calculations with a realistic description of the electrolyte (water). Here, we carry out QM calculations with an explicit description of water on the Cu(100) surface (experimentally shown to be stable under CO2 reduction reaction conditions) to examine the initial reaction pathways to form CO and formate (HCOO\xe2\x80\x93) from CO2 through free energy calculations at 298 K and pH 7. We find that CO formation proceeds from physisorbed CO2 to chemisorbed CO2 (*CO2\xce\xb4\xe2\x88\x92), with a free energy barrier of \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 0.43 eV, the rate-determining step (RDS). The subsequent barriers of protonating *CO2\xce\xb4\xe2\x88\x92 to form COOH* and then dissociating COOH* to form *CO are 0.37 and 0.30 eV, respectively. HCOO\xe2\x80\x93 formation proceeds through a very different pathway in which physisorbed CO2 reacts directly with a surface H* (along with electron transfer), leading to \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 0.80 eV. Thus, the competition between CO formation and HCOO\xe2\x80\x93 formation occurs in the first electron-transfer step. On Cu(100), the RDS for CO formation is lower, making CO the predominant product. Thus, to alter the product distribution, we need to control this first step of CO2 binding, which might involve controlling pH, alloying, or changing the structure at the nanoscale."
"Methods that directly functionalize pyridines are in high demand due to their presence in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. A reaction that selectively transforms the 4-position C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds in pyridines into C\xe2\x80\x93PPh3+ groups that are subsequently converted into heteroaryl ethers is presented. The two step sequence is effective on complex pyridines, pharmaceutical molecules, and other classes of heterocycles. Initial studies show that C\xe2\x80\x93C, C\xe2\x80\x93N, and C\xe2\x80\x93S bond formations are also amenable."
"An inverse CeO2/Cu2O/Cu(111) catalyst is able to activate methane at room temperature producing C, CHx fragments and COx species on the oxide surface. The addition of water to the system leads to a drastic change in the selectivity of methane activation yielding only adsorbed CHx fragments. At a temperature of 450 K, in the presence of water, a CH4 \xe2\x86\x92 CH3OH catalytic transformation occurs with a high selectivity. OH groups formed by the dissociation of water saturate the catalyst surface, removing sites that could decompose CHx fragments, and generating centers on which methane can directly interact to yield methanol."
"Alkyne metathesis provided an efficient macrocyclization route to a cycloparaphenyleneacetylene derivative in high yield. The cavity size was suitably matched for C70 which was tightly bound in an induced-fit fashion. The strained alkynes enabled a copper-free, 3-fold azide\xe2\x80\x93alkyne cycloaddition at 50 \xc2\xb0C."
"A novel molecular photocatalytic system with not only high reduction ability of CO2 but also high capture ability of CO2 has been developed using a Ru(II)\xe2\x80\x93Re(I) dinuclear complex as a photocatalyst. By using this photocatalytic system, CO2 of 10% concentration could be selectively converted to CO with almost same photocatalysis to that under a pure CO2 atmosphere (TONCO > 1000, \xce\xa6CO > 0.4). Even 0.5% concentration of CO2 was reduced with 60% initial efficiency of CO formation by using the same system compared to that using pure CO2 (TONCO > 200). The Re(I) catalyst unit in the photocatalyst can efficiently capture CO2, which proceeds CO2 insertion to the Re\xe2\x80\x93O bond, and then reduce the captured CO2 by using an electron supplied from the photochemically reduced Ru photosensitizer unit."
"Thirty-six porphyrin-based metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs) with composition of (M3O)2(TCPP-M)3 and M3O trigonal SBUs of various metals, Mg3O, Mn3O, Co3O, Ni3O, and Fe3O including mixed-metal SBUs, MnxFe3\xe2\x80\x93xO, NixFe3\xe2\x80\x93xO, CoxNi3\xe2\x80\x93xO, MnxCo3\xe2\x80\x93xO, MnxMg3\xe2\x80\x93xO, and MnxNi3\xe2\x80\x93xO were synthesized and characterized. These multivariate MOFs (MTV-MOFs) were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV\xe2\x80\x93vis diffuse reflectance spectra, and for the first time, their metal spatial arrangement deciphered and were found to exist in the form of either domains or well-mixed. We find that MTV-MOFs with well-mixed metals in their SBUs, rather than the SBUs having one kind of metal but different from one SBU to another, perform better than the sum of their parts in the test reaction involving the photo-oxidation of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene."
We report decarboxylative carbonyl \xce\xb1-arylation by coupling of arylboron nucleophiles with malonic acid derivatives. This process is enabled by the merger of aerobic oxidative Cu catalysis with decarboxylative enolate interception reminiscent of malonyl-CoA reactivity in polyketide biosynthesis. This method enables the synthesis of monoaryl acetate derivatives containing electrophilic functional groups that are incompatible with existing \xce\xb1-arylation reactivity paradigms. The utility of the reaction is demonstrated in drug intermediate synthesis and late-stage functionalization.
The preparation of unsaturated secondary lactams via the palladium-catalyzed cyclization of O-phenyl hydroxamates onto a pendent alkene is reported. This method provides rapid access to a broad range of lactams that are widely useful building blocks in alkaloid synthesis. Mechanistic studies support an aza-Heck-type pathway.
"Iptycenes are intriguing compounds receiving considerable attention as a result of their rigid noncompliant three-dimensional architecture. The preparation of larger iptycenes is often problematic, as a result of their limited solubility and synthetic procedures involving multiple Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder reactions under harsh extended reaction conditions. We report a mechanochemical synthesis of structurally well-defined iptycenes through an iterative reaction sequence, wherein Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder reactions and a subsequent aromatization afford higher order iptycenes. We further report that double Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder reactions under solvent-free condition provide facile access to highly functionalized iptycenes with molecular weights over 2000 Da. Quartz crystal microbalance measurements reveal that these materials efficiently absorb the aromatic hydrocarbons benzene and toluene."
"The tendency of high-valence xenon to form consolidated oxide structures is herein supported by the study of K4Xe3O12, the first example of a layered xenon perovskite. Xenon seems to be the only nontransition element that can adopt single-cation oxide perovskite frameworks. At the same time, peculiarities of electronic structure of xenon impose specific features on the bonding within a perovskite structure. Weak supramolecular interactions known as aerogen bonds are the linkers that maintain structural integrity of perovskite slabs in K4Xe3O12. The occurrence of aerogen bonding can provide an insight into the explosive properties of K4Xe3O12: the weakness of supramolecular interactions allows consideration of them as possible trigger bonds responsible for the detonation sensitivity of layered xenon perovskite."
"To examine the effect of the torsional constraints imposed on DNA substrates on Cas9 cleavage, we prepared constrained DNA substrates using a DNA origami frame. By fixing the dsDNA at the connectors of the DNA frame, we created torsionally constrained or relaxed substrates. We quantified the cleavage of constrained and relaxed substrates by Cas9 with qPCR. Moreover, we observed the Cas9/sgRNA complex bound to the DNA substrates and characterized the dissociation of the complex with high-speed atomic force microscopy. The results revealed that the constrained nontarget strand reduced the cleavage efficiency of Cas9 drastically, whereas torsional constraints on the target strand had little effect on the cleavage. The present study suggests that highly ordered and constrained DNA structures could be obstacles for Cas9 and additionally provides insights in Cas9 dissociation at a single molecule level."
"A highly selective cascade reaction that allows the direct transformation of dienallenes to spirocyclobutenes (spiro[3.4]octenes) as single diastereoisomers has been developed. The reaction involves formation of overall four C\xe2\x80\x93C bonds and proceeds via a palladium-catalyzed oxidative transformation with insertion of olefin, olefin, and carbon monoxide. Under slightly different reaction conditions, an additional CO insertion takes place to give spiro[4.4]nonenes with formation of overall five C\xe2\x80\x93C bonds."
"We report a one-pot synthesis of atomically dispersed Ru on ultrathin Pd nanoribbons. By using synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements in combination with aberration corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), we show that atomically dispersed Ru with content up to 5.9% was on the surface of the ultrathin nanoribbon. Furthermore, the ultrathin Pd/Ru nanoribbons could remarkably prohibit the hydrogenolysis in chemoselective hydrogenation of C\xe2\x95\x90C bonds, leading to an excellent catalytic selectivity compared with commercial Pd/C and Ru/C."
"Intermolecular functionalizations of aliphatic C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds offer unique strategies for the synthesis and late-stage derivatization of complex molecules, but the chemical space accessible remains limited. Herein, we report a transformation significantly expanding the chemotypes accessible via C\xe2\x80\x93H functionalization. The C\xe2\x80\x93H xanthylation proceeds in useful chemical yields with the substrate as the limiting reagent using blue LEDs and an easily prepared N-xanthylamide. The late-stage functionalizations of complex molecules occur with high levels of site selectivity, and a variety of common functionality is tolerated in the reaction. This approach capitalizes on the versatility of the xanthate functional group via both polar and radical manifolds to unlock a wide array of C\xe2\x80\x93H transformations previously inaccessible in synthesis."
The enantioselective synthesis of 4-fluoroisochromanones via chiral aryl iodide-catalyzed fluorolactonization is reported. This methodology uses HF-pyridine as a nucleophilic fluoride source with a peracid stoichiometric oxidant and provides access to lactones containing fluorine-bearing stereogenic centers in high enantio- and diastereoselectivity. The regioselectivity observed in these lactonization reactions is complementary to that obtained with established asymmetric electrophilic fluorination protocols.
"Alkyl oxalates, prepared from their corresponding alcohols, are engaged for the first time as carbon radical fragments in metallaphotoredox catalysis. In this report, we demonstrate that alcohols, native organic functional groups, can be readily activated with simple oxalyl chloride to become radical precursors in a net redox-neutral Csp3\xe2\x80\x93Csp2 cross-coupling with a broad range of aryl halides. This alcohol-activation coupling is successfully applied to the functionalization of a naturally occurring steroid and the expedient synthesis of a medicinally relevant drug lead."
"The unique properties of entirely aliphatic TAML activator [FeIII{(Me2CNCOCMe2NCO)2CMe2}OH2]\xe2\x88\x92 (3), namely the increased steric bulk of the ligand and the unmatched resistance to the acid-induced demetalation, enables the generation of high-valent iron derivatives in pure water at any pH. An iron(V)oxo species is readily produced with NaClO at pH values from 2 to 10.6 without any observable intermediate. This is the first reported example of iron(V)oxo formed in pure water. At pH 13, iron(V)oxo is not formed and NaClO oxidizes 3 to an iron(IV)oxo derivative."
"Here we report the use of the hexadehydro-Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder (HDDA) reaction for the de novo construction of a benzenoid ring in fused polycyclic heteroaromatic carbazole (i.e., [2,3]-benzoindole) skeletons. The strategy allows creation of highly substituted benzenoids. We also describe the HDDA-enabled chemical synthesis of the natural product alkaloids mahanimbine and koenidine. Trapping of the intermediate carbazolyne with a conjugated enal, proceeding through formal [2+2] cycloaddition, 4\xcf\x80-electrocyclic ring opening, and 6\xcf\x80-electrocyclic ring-closing events, constitutes a robust method for producing pyranocarbazoles."
"Hybrid organic\xe2\x80\x93inorganic metal halide perovskites have fascinating electronic properties and have already been implemented in various devices. Although the behavior of bulk metal halide perovskites has been widely studied, the properties of perovskite nanocrystals are less well-understood because synthesizing them is still very challenging, in part because of stability. Here we demonstrate a simple and versatile method to grow monodisperse CH3NH3PbBrxIx-3 perovskite nanocrystals inside mesoporous silica templates. The size of the nanocrystal is governed by the pore size of the templates (3.3, 3.7, 4.2, 6.2, and 7.1 nm). In-depth structural analysis shows that the nanocrystals maintain the perovskite crystal structure, but it is slightly distorted. Quantum confinement was observed by tuning the size of the particles via the template. This approach provides an additional route to tune the optical bandgap of the nanocrystal. The level of quantum confinement was modeled taking into account the dimensions of the rod-shaped nanocrystals and their close packing inside the channels of the template. Photoluminescence measurements on CH3NH3PbBr clearly show a shift from green to blue as the pore size is decreased. Synthesizing perovskite nanostructures in templates improves their stability and enables tunable electronic properties via quantum confinement. These structures may be useful as reference materials for comparison with other perovskites, or as functional materials in all solid-state light-emitting diodes."
"In Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease, aggregation of the \xce\xb2-amyloid peptide (A\xce\xb2) results in the formation of oligomers and fibrils that are associated with neurodegeneration. Aggregation of A\xce\xb2 occurs through interactions between different regions of the peptide. This paper and the accompanying paper constitute a two-part investigation of two key regions of A\xce\xb2: the central region and the C-terminal region. These two regions promote aggregation and adopt \xce\xb2-sheet structure in the fibrils, and may also do so in the oligomers. In this paper, we study the assembly of macrocyclic \xce\xb2-sheet peptides that contain residues 17\xe2\x80\x9323 (LVFFAED) from the central region and residues 30\xe2\x80\x9336 (AIIGLMV) from the C-terminal region. These peptides assemble to form tetramers. Each tetramer consists of two hydrogen-bonded dimers that pack through hydrophobic interactions in a sandwich-like fashion. Incorporation of a single 15N isotopic label into each peptide provides a spectroscopic probe with which to elucidate the \xce\xb2-sheet assembly and interaction: 1H,15N HSQC studies facilitate the identification of the monomers and tetramers; 15N-edited NOESY studies corroborate the pairing of the dimers within the tetramers. In the following paper, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, DOI: 10.1021/jacs.6b06001, we will extend these studies to elucidate the coassembly of the peptides to form heterotetramers."
"In this paper, we investigate the coassembly of peptides derived from the central and C-terminal regions of the \xce\xb2-amyloid peptide (A\xce\xb2). In the preceding paper, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, DOI: 10.1021/jacs.6b06000, we established that peptides containing residues 17\xe2\x80\x9323 (LVFFAED) from the central region of A\xce\xb2 and residues 30\xe2\x80\x9336 (AIIGLMV) from the C-terminal region of A\xce\xb2 assemble to form homotetramers consisting of two hydrogen-bonded dimers. Here, we mix these tetramer-forming peptides and determine how they coassemble. Incorporation of a single 15N isotopic label into each peptide provides a spectroscopic probe with which to elucidate the coassembly of the peptides by 1H,15N HSQC. Job\xe2\x80\x99s method of continuous variation and nonlinear least-squares fitting reveal that the peptides form a mixture of heterotetramers in 3:1, 2:2, and 1:3 stoichiometries, in addition to the homotetramers. These studies also establish the relative stability of each tetramer and show that the 2:2 heterotetramer predominates. 15N-Edited NOESY shows the 2:2 heterotetramer comprises two different homodimers, rather than two heterodimers. The peptides within the heterotetramer segregate in forming the homodimer subunits, but the two homodimers coassemble in forming the heterotetramer. These studies show that the central and C-terminal regions of A\xce\xb2 can preferentially segregate within \xce\xb2-sheets and that the resulting segregated \xce\xb2-sheets can further coassemble."
"Identification of small-molecule-binding sites in protein is important for drug discovery and analysis of protein function. Modified amino-acid residue(s) can be identified by proteolytic cleavage followed by liquid chromatography\xe2\x80\x93mass spectrometry (LC\xe2\x80\x93MS), but this is often hindered by the complexity of the peptide mixtures. We have developed alkyne-tag Raman screening (ATRaS) for identifying binding sites. In ATRaS, small molecules are tagged with alkyne and form covalent bond with proteins. After proteolysis and HPLC, fractions containing the labeled peptides with alkyne tags are detected by means of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) using silver nanoparticles and sent to MS/MS to identify the binding site. The use of SERS realizes high sensitivity (detection limit: \xe2\x88\xbc100 femtomole) and reproducibility in the peptide screening. By using an automated ATRaS system, we successfully identified the inhibitor-binding site in cysteine protease cathepsin B, a potential drug target and prognostic marker for tumor metastasis. We further showed that the ATRaS system works for complex mixtures of trypsin-digested cell lysate. The ATRaS technology, which provides high molecular selectivity to LC\xe2\x80\x93MS analysis, has potential to contribute in various research fields, such as drug discovery, proteomics, metabolomics and chemical biology."
"Self-assembly of proteins into ordered, fibrillar structures is a commonly observed theme in biology. It has been observed that diverse set of proteins (e.g., alpha-synuclein, insulin, TATA-box binding protein, Sup35, p53), independent of their sequence, native structure, or function could self-assemble into highly ordered structures known as amyloids. What are the crucial features underlying amyloidogenesis that make it so generic? Using coarse-grained simulations of peptide self-assembly, we argue that variation in two physical parameters\xe2\x80\x94bending stiffness of the polypeptide and strength of intermolecular interactions\xe2\x80\x94can give rise to many of the structural features typically associated with amyloid self-assembly. We show that the interplay between these two factors gives rise to a rich phase diagram displaying high diversity in aggregated states. For certain parameters, we find a bimodal distribution for the order parameter implying the coexistence of ordered and disordered aggregates. Our findings may explain the experimentally observed variability including the \xe2\x80\x9coff-pathway\xe2\x80\x9d aggregated structures. Further, we demonstrate that sequence-dependence and protein-specific signatures could be mapped to our coarse-grained framework to study self-assembly behavior of realistic systems such as the STVIIE peptide and A\xce\xb242. The work also provides certain guiding principles that could be used to design novel peptides with desired self-assembly properties, by tuning a few physical parameters."
"Nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon materials have been extensively studied as potential replacements for Pt-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, little is known about the catalytic mechanisms, including the parameters that determine the selectivity of the reaction. By comparing theoretical calculations of the ORR selectivity at a well-defined graphene nanostructure with experimental results, we propose a model based on interfacial solvation to explain the observed preference for the four-electron pathway in alkaline electrolytes. The hydrophobic environment around the active sites, as in enzymatic catalysis, restricts the access of water and destabilizes small ionic species such as peroxide, the product of the two-electron pathway. This model, when applied to acidic electrolytes, shows the ORR preferring the two-electron pathway, consistent with the well-known pH-dependent ORR selectivity catalyzed by graphitic carbon materials. Because of the similarity between more complex N-doped graphitic carbon materials and our model system, we can extend this model to the former and rationalize nearly all of the previously reported experimental results on the selectivity of ORR catalyzed by these materials."
"The kinetics involved in a recently revealed ambient-temperature mechanism for the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide by oxygen over a 5 wt % Pt/Al2O3 catalyst are evaluated within a periodic, plug flow, redox operation paradigm using combined mass spectrometry (MS), diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and time-resolved Pt L3-edge XAFS. The species that are the most active at room temperature are shown to be a high-wavenumber (ca. 1690 cm\xe2\x80\x931) carbonate that we associate directly with a room-temperature redox process occurring in a fraction of the Pt atoms present in the catalyst. Our results, however, do not exclude the participation of carbonate species native to the Al2O3 support, though these species tend to store CO at ambient temperature and become significant participants in CO oxidation catalysis only at slightly higher temperatures (323\xe2\x80\x93333 K). Pt carbonate formation (1690 cm\xe2\x80\x931) under CO and the reaction to yield CO2 is shown to be extremely rapid and subject to an average apparent activation energy (Eapp), across the techniques applied, of 8.7 kJ mol\xe2\x80\x931, within the temperature range investigated (276\xe2\x80\x93343 K). Reoxidation of Pt (XANES) and subsequent CO2 production mediated by Pt carbonates under O2 (MS/IR) displays a first-order dependence upon O2 partial pressure and a negative dependence upon the coverage of CO adsorbed on the Pt nanoparticles also present in this catalyst. This oxidative regeneration/CO2 production step is subject to an apparent activation energy (Eapp) of 56.5 (\xc2\xb15) kJ mol\xe2\x80\x931, is kinetically limited by the desorption of molecular CO from Pt nanoparticles, and also is shown to be dependent upon the partial pressure of O2 present in the oxidizing half of the cycle that we associate with the direct interaction of O2 with molecular CO adsorbed on the nanoparticles that promotes their desorption. Finally, a minority reactive state producing CO2 in the oxidizing cycle that displays no dependence upon the CO coverage of the nanoparticles can be induced through simple thermal treatment of the catalyst. These results are discussed in terms of the number and types of species present within the reactive system and in terms of the wider possibilities for the development of effective low-temperature CO oxidation using Pt/Al2O3 catalysts."
"Arylazide and diazene activation by highly reduced uranium(IV) complexes bearing trianionic redox-active pyridine(diimine) ligands, [CpPU(MesPDIMe)]2 (1-CpP), Cp*U(MesPDIMe)(THF) (1-Cp*) (CpP = 1-(7,7-dimethylbenzyl)cyclopentadienide; Cp* = \xce\xb75-1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienide), and Cp*U(tBu-MesPDIMe) (THF) (1-tBu) (2,6-((Mes)N\xe2\x95\x90CMe)2-p-R-C5H2N, Mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl; R = H, MesPDIMe; R = C(CH3)3, tBu-MesPDIMe), has been investigated. While 1-Cp* and 1-CpP readily reduce N3R (R = Ph, p-tolyl) to form trans-bis(imido) species, CpPU(NAr)2(MesPDIMe) (Ar = Ph, 2-CpP; Ar = p-Tol, 3-CpP) and Cp*U(NPh)2(MesPDIMe) (2-Cp*), only 1-Cp* can cleave diazene N\xe2\x95\x90N double bonds to form the same product. Complexes 2-Cp*, 2-CpP, and 3-CpP are uranium(V) trans-bis(imido) species supported by neutral [MesPDIMe]0 ligands formed by complete oxidation of [MesPDIMe]3\xe2\x80\x93 ligands of 1-CpP and 1-Cp*. Variation of the arylimido substituent in 2-Cp* from phenyl to p-tolyl, forming Cp*U(NTol)2(MesPDIMe) (3-Cp*), changes the electronic structure, generating a uranium(VI) ion with a monoanionic pyridine(diimine) radical. The tert-butyl-substituted analogue, Cp*U(NTol)2(tBu-MesPDIMe) (3-tBu), displays the same electronic structure. Oxidation of the ligand radical in 3-Cp* and 3-tBu by Ag(I) forms cationic uranium(VI) [Cp*U(NTol)2(MesPDIMe)][SbF6] (4-Cp*) and [Cp*U(NTol)2(tBu-MesPDIMe)][SbF6] (4-tBu), respectively, as confirmed by metrical parameters. Conversely, oxidation of pentavalent 2-Cp* with AgSbF6 affords cationic [Cp*U(NPh)2(MesPDIMe)][SbF6] (5-Cp*) from a metal-based U(V)/U(VI) oxidation. All complexes have been characterized by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy with assignments confirmed by electronic absorption spectroscopy. The effective nuclear charge at uranium has been probed using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, while structural parameters of 1-CpP, 3-Cp*, 3-tBu, 4-Cp*, 4-tBu, and 5-Cp* have been elucidated by X-ray crystallography."
"This paper demonstrates the direct sensing of glucose at physiologically relevant concentrations with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) on gold film-over-nanosphere (AuFON) substrates functionalized with bisboronic acid receptors. The combination of selectivity in the bisboronic acid receptor and spectral resolution in the SERS data allow the sensors to resolve glucose in high backgrounds of fructose and, in combination with multivariate statistical analysis, detect glucose accurately in the 1\xe2\x80\x9310 mM range. Computational modeling supports assignments of the normal modes and vibrational frequencies for the monoboronic acid base of our bisboronic acids, glucose and fructose. These results are promising for the use of bisboronic acids as receptors in SERS-based in vivo glucose monitoring sensors."
"A class of tunable visible and near-infrared donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) photoswitches were efficiently synthesized in two to four steps from commercially available starting materials with minimal purification. Using either Meldrum\xe2\x80\x99s or barbituric acid \xe2\x80\x9cacceptors\xe2\x80\x9d in combination with aniline-based \xe2\x80\x9cdonors\xe2\x80\x9d, an absorption range spanning from 450 to 750 nm is obtained. Additionally, photoisomerization results in complete decoloration for all adducts, yielding fully transparent, colorless solutions and films. Detailed investigations using density functional theory, nuclear magnetic resonance, and visible absorption spectroscopies provide valuable insight into the unique structure\xe2\x80\x93property relationships for this novel class of photoswitches. As a final demonstration, selective photochromism is accomplished in a variety of solvents and polymer matrices, a significant advantage for applications of this new generation of DASAs."
"The human transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is a 150 kDa heterodimeric ABC transport complex that selects peptides for export into the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent loading onto major histocompatibility complex class I molecules to trigger adaptive immune responses against virally or malignantly transformed cells. To date, no atomic-resolution information on peptide\xe2\x80\x93TAP interactions has been obtained, hampering a mechanistic understanding of the early steps of substrate translocation catalyzed by TAP. Here, we developed a mild method to concentrate an unstable membrane protein complex and combined this effort with dynamic nuclear polarization enhanced magic angle spinning solid-state NMR to study this challenging membrane protein\xe2\x80\x93substrate complex. We were able to determine the atomic-resolution backbone conformation of an antigenic peptide bound to human TAP. Our NMR data also provide unparalleled insights into the nature of the interactions between the side chains of the antigen peptide and TAP. By combining NMR data and molecular modeling, the location of the peptide binding cavity has been identified, revealing a complex scenario of peptide\xe2\x80\x93TAP recognition. Our findings reveal a structural and chemical basis of substrate selection rules, which define the crucial function of this ABC transporter in human immunity and health. This work is the first NMR study of a eukaryotic transporter protein and presents the power of solid-state NMR in this growing field."
"For the smallest nanostructures (<5 nm), small changes in structure can lead to significant changes in properties and reactivity. In the case of nanoparticle (NP)-functionalized electrodes, NP structure and composition, and the nature of the NP-electrode interface have a strong influence upon electrochemical properties that are critical in applications such as amperometric sensing, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Existing methods to fabricate NP-functionalized electrodes do not allow for precise control over all these variables, especially the NP-electrode interface, making it difficult to understand and predict how structural changes influence NP activity. We investigated the electrochemical properties of small (dcore < 2.5 nm) gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on boron doped diamond electrodes using three different electrode fabrication techniques with varying degrees of nanoparticle-electrode interface definition. Two methods to attach AuNPs to the electrode through a covalently bound molecular linker were developed and compared to NP-functionalized electrodes fabricated using solution deposition methods (drop-casting and physiadsorption of a monolayer). In each case, a ferrocene redox probe was tethered to the AuNP surface to evaluate electron transfer through the AuNPs. The AuNPs that were molecularly interfaced with the electrode exhibited nearly ideal, reproducible electrochemical behavior with narrow redox peaks and small peak separations, whereas the solution deposited NPs had broader redox peaks with large peak separations. These data suggest that the molecular tether facilitates AuNP-mediated electron transfer. Interestingly, the molecularly tethered NPs also had significantly more electrochemically active surface area than the solution deposited NPs. The enhanced electrochemical behavior of the molecularly interfaced NPs demonstrates the significant influence of the interface on NP-mediated electron transfer and suggests that similar modified electrodes can serve as versatile platforms for studies and applications of nanoparticles."
"While a great deal of knowledge on the roles of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobicity in proteins has resulted in the creation of rationally designed and functional peptidic structures, the roles of these forces on purely synthetic supramolecular architectures in water have proven difficult to ascertain. Focusing on a 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxamide (BTA)-based supramolecular polymer, we have designed a molecular modeling strategy to dissect the energetic contributions involved in the self-assembly (electrostatic, hydrophobic, etc.) upon growth of both ordered BTA stacks and random BTA aggregates. Utilizing this set of simulations, we have unraveled the cooperative mechanism for polymer growth, where a critical size must be reached in the aggregates before emergence and amplification of order into the experimentally observed fibers. Furthermore, we have found that the formation of ordered fibers is favored over disordered aggregates solely on the basis of electrostatic interactions. Detailed analysis of the simulation data suggests that H-bonding is a major source of this stabilization energy. Experimental and computational comparison with a newly synthesized 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxyester (BTE) derivative, lacking the ability to form the H-bonding network, demonstrated that this BTE variant is also capable of fiber formation, albeit at a reduced persistence length. This work provides unambiguous evidence for the key 1D driving force of hydrogen bonding in enhancing the persistency of monomer stacking and amplifying the level of order into the growing supramolecular polymer in water. Our computational approach provides an important relationship directly linking the structure of the monomer to the structure and properties of the supramolecular polymer."
"An isolable NHC-coordinated disilenyl germylene R2Si\xe2\x95\x90SiR-GePh\xc2\xb7NHCiPr2Me2 (5b: R = 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl, NHCiPr2Me2 = 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene) is obtained from the reaction of the \xce\xb1-chloro silyl functionalized heavier vinylidene analogue R2(Cl)Si-RSi\xe2\x95\x90Ge\xc2\xb7NHCiPr2Me2 with phenyllithium. The disilenyl germylene 5b isomerizes at 40 \xc2\xb0C to the NHC-adduct of the corresponding heavier cyclopropylidene analogue 6b. Both 5b and 6b display near perfect regiodiscrimination in their reactions with phenylacetylene and xylyl isocyanide, affording in the case of each reagent two different regioisomers of NHC-coordinated cyclic germylenes. DFT calculations reveal that the Si\xe2\x95\x90Si bond accounts for the high reactivity of 5b even at low temperature while in the case of cyclic 6b the low-valent germanium center requires a considerable thermal activation."
"The stereospecific reductive cross-electrophile coupling reaction of 2-vinyl-4-halotetrahydropyrans for vinylcyclopropane synthesis is reported. The nickel-catalyzed reaction occurs with both alkyl fluorides and alkyl chlorides. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported cross-electrophile coupling reaction of an alkyl fluoride. Ring contraction proceeds with high stereospecificity, providing selective synthesis of either diastereomer of di- and trisubstituted cyclopropanes. The utility of this methodology is demonstrated by several synthetic applications including the synthesis of the natural product dictyopterene A. 2-Vinyl-4-fluorotetrahydrofurans also undergo stereospecific ring contractions, providing access to synthetically useful hydroxymethyl cyclopropanes."
"The hydroxide-catalyzed hydrolysis of aryl 1,2-trans-glycosides proceeds through a mechanism involving neighboring group participation by a C2-oxyanion and rate-limiting formation of a 1,2-anhydro sugar (oxirane) intermediate. The transition state for the hydroxide-catalyzed hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl \xce\xb1-d-mannopyranoside in aqueous media has been studied by the use of multiple kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements in conjunction with ab initio theoretical methods. The experimental KIEs are C1-2H (1.112 \xc2\xb1 0.004), C2-2H (1.045 \xc2\xb1 0.005), anomeric 1-13C (1.026 \xc2\xb1 0.006), C2-13C (0.999 \xc2\xb1 0.005), leaving group oxygen 2-18O (1.040 \xc2\xb1 0.012), and C2-18O (1.044 \xc2\xb1 0.006). The transition state for the hydrolysis reaction was modeled computationally using the experimental KIE values as constraints. Taken together, the reported kinetic isotope effects and computational modeling are consistent with the reaction mechanism involving rate-limiting formation of a transient oxirane intermediate that opens in water to give \xce\xb1-d-mannopyranose. The transition state has significant nucleophilic participation by the C2-alkoxide, an essentially cleaved glycosidic bond, and a slight shortening of the endocyclic C1\xe2\x80\x93O5 bond. The TS is late, consistent with the large, normal C2-18O isotope effect."
"The mechanism of the Ir(III)- and Rh(III)-mediated C\xe2\x80\x93N coupling reaction, which is the key step for catalytic C\xe2\x80\x93H amidation, was investigated in an integrated experimental and computational study. Novel amidating agents containing a 1,4,2-dioxazole moiety allowed for designing a stoichiometric version of the catalytic C\xe2\x80\x93N coupling reaction and giving access to reaction intermediates that reveal details about each step of the reaction. Both DFT and kinetic studies strongly point to a mechanism where the M(III)-complex engages the amidating agent via oxidative coupling to form a M(V)\xe2\x80\x93imido intermediate, which then undergoes migratory insertion to afford the final C\xe2\x80\x93N coupled product. For the first time, the stoichiometric versions of the Ir- and Rh-mediated amidation reaction were compared systematically to each other. Iridium reacts much faster than rhodium (\xe2\x88\xbc1100 times at 6.7 \xc2\xb0C) with the oxidative coupling being so fast that the activation of the initial Ir(III)-complex becomes rate-limiting. In the case of Rh, the Rh\xe2\x80\x93imido formation step is rate-limiting. These qualitative differences stem from a unique bonding feature of the dioxazole moiety and the relativistic contraction of the Ir(V), which affords much more favorable energetics for the reaction. For the first time, a full molecular orbital analysis is presented to rationalize and explain the electronic features that govern this behavior."
"We set out to design, synthesize, and optimize a DNA-minimal cage capable of encapsulating oligonucleotide drugs to facilitate their delivery. Through rational design and optimization using in vitro assays, we have assembled the first DNA \xe2\x80\x9cnanosuitcase\xe2\x80\x9d that can encapsulate a siRNA construct and release it upon recognition of an oligonucleotide trigger. The latter may be a mRNA or a microRNA (miRNA) which offers potential for dual or synergistic therapy. This construct assembles in near 100% yield, releases its cargo on demand, and can sustain biological conditions. Moreover, we find that the DNA scaffold is able to protect its cargo against site-specific cleavage and nuclease degradation. Release of the cargo is performed with fixed cells using a FRET-enabled construct imaged by confocal microscopy and reveals that the DNA cage remains responsive at the molecular level in a complex cellular environment. We foresee this construct will be able to address challenges in drug delivery, more specifically in nontoxic delivery and targeted release."
"Olefin metathesis reactions with 3E-1,3-dienes using Z-selective cyclometalated ruthenium benzylidene catalysts are described. In particular, a procedure for employing 3E-1,3-dienes in Z-selective homodimerization and cross-metathesis with terminal alkenes is detailed. The reaction takes advantage of the pronounced chemoselectivity of a recently reported ruthenium-based catalyst containing a cyclometalated NHC ligand for terminal alkenes in the presence of internal E-alkenes. A wide array of commonly encountered functional groups can be tolerated, and only a small excess (1.5 equiv) of the diene coupling partner is required to achieve high yields of the desired internal E,Z-diene cross-metathesis product. Computational studies have been performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism. The computations are consistent with a diene-first pathway. The reaction can be used to quickly assemble structurally complex targets. The power of this cross-metathesis reaction is demonstrated by the concise syntheses of two insect pheromones."
"For CO and N2 on Mg2+ sites of the metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework CPO-27-Mg (Mg-MOF-74), ab initio calculations of Gibbs free energies of adsorption have been performed. Combined with the Bragg-Williams/Langmuir model and taking into account the experimental site availability (76.5%), we obtained adsorption isotherms in close agreement with those in experiment. The remaining deviations in the Gibbs free energy (about 1 kJ/mol) are significantly smaller than the \xe2\x80\x9cchemical accuracy\xe2\x80\x9d limit of about 4 kJ/mol. The presented approach uses (i) a DFT dispersion method (PBE+D2) to optimize the structure and to calculate anharmonic frequencies for vibrational partition functions and (ii) a \xe2\x80\x9chybrid MP2:(PBE+D2)+\xce\x94CCSD(T)\xe2\x80\x9d method to determine electronic energies. With the achieved accuracy (estimated uncertainty \xc2\xb11.4 kJ/mol), the ab initio energies become useful benchmarks for assessing different DFT + dispersion methods (PBE+D2, B3LYP+D*, and vdW-D2), whereas the ab initio heats, entropies, and Gibbs free energies of adsorption are used to assess the reliability of experimental values derived from fitting isotherms or from variable-temperature IR studies."
"Polarization-selective angle-resolved infrared pump\xe2\x80\x93probe spectroscopy was developed and used to study the orientational dynamics of a planar alkylsiloxane monolayer functionalized with a rhenium metal carbonyl headgroup on an SiO2 surface. The technique, together with a time-averaged infrared linear dichroism measurement, characterized picosecond orientational relaxation of the headgroup occurring at the monolayer\xe2\x80\x93air interface by employing several sets of incident angles of the infrared pulses relative to the sample surface. By application of this method and using a recently developed theory, it was possible to extract both the out-of-plane and \xe2\x80\x9cmainly\xe2\x80\x9d-in-plane orientational correlation functions in a model-independent manner. The observed correlation functions were compared with theoretically derived correlation functions based on several dynamical models. The out-of-plane correlation function reveals the highly restricted out-of-plane motions of the head groups and also suggests that the angular distribution of the transition dipole moments is bimodal. The mainly-in-plane correlation function, for the sample studied here with the strongly restricted out-of-plane motions, essentially arises from the purely in-plane dynamics. In contrast to the out-of-plane dynamics, significant in-plane motions occurring over various time scales were observed including an inertial motion, a restricted wobbling motion of \xe2\x88\xbc3 ps, and complete randomization occurring in \xe2\x88\xbc25 ps."
"HIV-1 CA capsid protein possesses intrinsic conformational flexibility, which is essential for its assembly into conical capsids and interactions with host factors. CA is dynamic in the assembled capsid, and residues in functionally important regions of the protein undergo motions spanning many decades of time scales. Chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) tensors, recorded in magic-angle-spinning NMR experiments, provide direct residue-specific probes of motions on nano- to microsecond time scales. We combined NMR, MD, and density-functional-theory calculations, to gain quantitative understanding of internal backbone dynamics in CA assemblies, and we found that the dynamically averaged 15N CSA tensors calculated by this joined protocol are in remarkable agreement with experiment. Thus, quantitative atomic-level understanding of the relationships between CSA tensors, local backbone structure, and motions in CA assemblies is achieved, demonstrating the power of integrating NMR experimental data and theory for characterizing atomic-resolution dynamics in biological systems."
"Toehold-mediated DNA strand displacement is the fundamental basis for the construction and operation of diverse DNA devices, including circuits, machines, sensors, and reconfigurable structures. Controllable activation and regulation of toeholds are critical to construct devices with multistep, autonomous, and complex behaviors. A handful of unique toehold activation mechanisms, including toehold-exchange, associative toehold, and remote toehold, have been developed and are often combined to achieve desired strand displacement behaviors and functions. Here we report an allosteric DNA toehold (A-toehold) design that allows the flexible regulation of DNA strand displacement by splitting an input strand into an A-toehold and branch migration domain. Because of its simplicity, the A-toehold mechanism can be a useful addition to the current toolbox of DNA strand displacement techniques. We demonstrated that A-toehold enabled a number of interesting functions that were previously shown using more sophisticated DNA strand displacement systems, including (1) continuously tuning the rate of strand displacement, (2) dynamic control of strand displacement reactions, and (3) selective activation of multiple strand displacement reactions. Moreover, by combining A-toehold and toehold-exchange mechanisms, we have successfully constructed a noncovalent DNA catalysis network that resembles an allosteric enzyme."
"A series of (dppf)Ni(ketene) complexes were synthesized and fully characterized. In the solid state, the complexes possess \xce\xb72-(C,O) coordination of the ketene in an overall planar configuration. They display similar structure in solution, except in some cases, the \xce\xb72-(C,C) coordination mode is also detected. A combination of kinetic analysis and DFT calculations reveals the complexes undergo thermal decomposition by isomerization from \xce\xb72-(C,O) to \xce\xb72-(C,C) followed by scission of the C\xe2\x95\x90C bond, which is usually rate limiting and results in an intermediate carbonyl carbene complex. Subsequent rearrangement of the carbene ligand is rate limiting for electron poor and sterically large ketenes, and results in a carbonyl alkene complex. The alkene readily dissociates, affording alkenes and (dppf)Ni(CO)2. Computational modeling of the decarbonylation pathway with partial phosphine dissociation reveals the barrier is reduced significantly, explaining the instability of ketene complexes with monodentate phosphines."
"Using a modified norbornene (methyl bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-2-carboxylate) as a transient mediator, meta-C\xe2\x80\x93H amination and meta-C\xe2\x80\x93H alkynylation of aniline and phenol substrates have been developed for the first time. Both the identification of a monoprotected 3-amino-2-hydroxypyridine/pyridone-type ligand and the use of a modified norbornene as a mediator are crucial for the realization of these two unprecedented meta-C\xe2\x80\x93H transformations. A variety of substrates are compatible with both meta-C\xe2\x80\x93H amination and meta-C\xe2\x80\x93H alkynylation. Amination and alkynylation of heterocyclic substrates including indole, indoline, and indazole afford the desired products in moderate to high yields."
"Synthetic molecules that bind sequence-specifically to DNA have been developed for varied biological applications, including anticancer activity, regulation of gene expression, and visualization of specific genomic regions. Increasing the number of base pairs targeted by synthetic molecules strengthens their sequence specificity. Our group has been working on the development of pyrrole\xe2\x80\x93imidazole polyamides that bind to the minor groove of DNA in a sequence-specific manner without causing denaturation. Recently, we reported a simple synthetic method of fluorescent tandem dimer polyamide probes composed of two hairpin moieties with a linking hinge, which bound to 12 bp in human telomeric repeats (5\xe2\x80\xb2-(TTAGGG)n-3\xe2\x80\xb2) and could be used to specifically visualize telomeres in chemically fixed cells under mild conditions. We also performed structural optimization and extension of the target base pairs to allow more specific staining of telomeres. In the present study, we synthesized tandem tetramer polyamides composed of four hairpin moieties, targeting 24 bp in telomeric repeats, the longest reported binding site for synthetic, non-nucleic-acid-based, sequence-specific DNA-binding molecules. The novel tandem tetramers bound with a nanomolar dissociation constant to 24 bp sequences made up of four telomeric repeats. Fluorescently labeled tandem tetramer polyamide probes could visualize human telomeres in chemically fixed cells with lower background signals than polyamide probes reported previously, suggesting that they had higher specificity for telomeres. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of human genomic DNA pulled down by the biotin-labeled tandem tetramer polyamide probe confirmed its effective binding to telomeric repeats in the complex chromatinized genome."
"In pursuit of new lithium-rich phases and potential electrides within the Li\xe2\x80\x93N phase diagram, we explore theoretically the ground-state structures and electronic properties of Li4N at P = 1 atm. Crystal structure exploration methods based on particle swarm optimization and evolutionary algorithms led to 25 distinct structures, including 23 dynamically stable structures, all quite close to each other in energy, but not in detailed structure. Several additional phases were obtained by following the imaginary phonon modes found in low-energy structures, as well as structures constructed to simulate segregation into Li and Li3N. The candidate Li4N structures all contain NLin polyhedra, with n = 6\xe2\x80\x939. They may be classified into three types, depending on their structural dimensionality: NLin extended polyhedral slabs joined by an elemental Li layer (type a), similar structures, but without the Li layer (type b), and three-dimensionally interconnected NLin polyhedra without any layering (type c). We investigate the electride nature of these structures using the electron localization function and partial charge density around the Fermi level. All of the structures can be characterized as electrides, but they differ in electronic dimensionality. Type-a and type-b structures may be classified as two-dimensional (2-D) electrides, while type-c structures emerge quite varied, as 0-D, 2-D, or 3-D. The calculated structural variety (as well as detailed models for amorphous and liquid Li4N) points to potential amorphous character and likely ionic conductivity in the material."
"Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) is widely recognized for its catalytic activities where the edges of the crystals turn over reactions. Generating sulfur defects on the basal plane of MoS2 can improve its catalytic activity, but generally, there is a lack of model systems for understanding metal-centered catalysis on the basal planes. Here, we synthesized a new phase of substoichiometric molybdenum sulfide (s-MoSx) on a sulfur-enriched copper substrate. The basal plane of s-MoSx contains chemically reactive Mo-rich sites that can undergo dynamic dissociative adsorption/desorption processes with molecular hydrogen, thus demonstrating its usefulness for hydrogen-transfer catalysis. In addition, scanning tunneling microscopy was used to monitor surface-directed Ullmann coupling of 2,8-dibromo-dibenzothiophene molecules on s-MoSx nanosheets, where the 4-fold symmetric surface sites on s-MoSx direct C\xe2\x80\x93C coupling to form cyclic tetramers with high selectivity."
"The reaction of cis-[PdCl2(CNXyl)2] (Xyl = 2,6-Me2C6H3) with various 1,3-thiazol- and 1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amines in chloroform gives a mixture of two regioisomeric binuclear diaminocarbene complexes. For 1,3-thiazol-2-amines the isomeric ratio depends on the reaction conditions and kinetically (KRs) or thermodynamically (TRs) controlled regioisomers were obtained at room temperature and on heating, respectively. In CHCl3 solutions, the isomers are subject to reversible isomerization accompanied by the cleavage of Pd\xe2\x80\x93N and C\xe2\x80\x93N bonds in the carbene fragment XylNCN(R)Xyl. Results of DFT calculations followed by the topological analysis of the electron density distribution within the formalism of Bader\xe2\x80\x99s theory (AIM method) reveal that in CHCl3 solution the relative stability of the regioisomers (\xce\x94Gexp = 1.2 kcal/mol; \xce\x94Gcalcd = 3.2 kcal/mol) is determined by the energy difference between two types of the intramolecular chalcogen bonds, viz. S\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Cl in KRs (2.8\xe2\x80\x933.0 kcal/mol) and S\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N in TRs (4.6\xe2\x80\x935.3 kcal/mol). In the case of the 1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amines, the regioisomers are formed in approximately equal amounts and, accordingly, the energy difference between these species is only 0.1 kcal/mol in terms of \xce\x94Gexp (\xce\x94Gcalcd = 2.1 kcal/mol). The regioisomers were characterized by elemental analyses (C, H, N), HRESI+-MS and FTIR, 1D (1H, 13C{1H}) and 2D (1H,1H-COSY, 1H,1H-NOESY, 1H,13C-HSQC, 1H,13C-HMBC) NMR spectroscopies, and structures of six complexes (three KRs and three TRs) were elucidated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction."
"MYC is overexpressed in many different cancer types and is an intensively studied oncogene because of its contributions to tumorigenesis. The regulation of MYC is complex, and the NHE III1 and FUSE elements rely upon noncanonical DNA structures and transcriptionally induced negative superhelicity. In the NHE III1 only the G-quadruplex has been extensively studied, whereas the role of the i-motif, formed on the opposite C-rich strand, is much less understood. We demonstrate here that the i-motif is formed within the 4CT element and is recognized by hnRNP K, which leads to a low level of transcription activation. For maximal hnRNP K transcription activation, two additional cytosine runs, located seven bases downstream of the i-motif-forming region, are also required. To access these additional runs of cytosine, increased negative superhelicity is necessary, which leads to a thermodynamically stable complex between hnRNP K and the unfolded i-motif. We also demonstrate mutual exclusivity between the MYC G-quadruplex and i-motif, providing a rationale for a molecular switch mechanism driven by SP1-induced negative superhelicity, where relative hnRNP K and nucleolin expression shifts the equilibrium to the on or off state."
"Photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction activity of a hybrid photocathode, based on a Ru(II)\xe2\x80\x93Re(I) supramolecular metal complex photocatalyst immobilized on a NiO electrode (NiO\xe2\x80\x93RuRe), was confirmed in an aqueous electrolyte solution. Under half-reaction conditions, the NiO\xe2\x80\x93RuRe photocathode generated CO with high selectivity, and its turnover number for CO formation reached 32 based on the amount of immobilized RuRe. A photoelectrochemical cell comprising a NiO\xe2\x80\x93RuRe photocathode and a CoOx/TaON photoanode showed activity for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction using water as a reductant to generate CO and O2, with the assistance of an external electrical (0.3 V) and chemical (0.10 V) bias produced by a pH difference. This is the first example of a molecular and semiconductor photocatalyst hybrid-constructed photoelectrochemical cell for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction using water as a reductant."
A molecular catalyst is shown to be stable in the highly acidic aqueous environments favored by current electrolytic cells for hydrogen evolution.
"Peptide synthesis is a truly interdisciplinary tool, familiar to a broad group of scientists who do not otherwise overlap scientifically. For this reason, some may perceive even complex peptide synthesis to be a \xe2\x80\x9csolved problem\xe2\x80\x9d, while others might argue that immense opportunity remains untapped or simply inaccessible. At the extreme of complexity, what might a concise assessment of the state-of-the-art in peptide synthesis look like? As one of the most practiced forms of synthetic chemistry by chemists and non-chemists alike, what restrictions remain that constrain access to chemical space? Using popular terminology, what forms of peptide synthesis are appropriately termed \xe2\x80\x9con-demand\xe2\x80\x9d? The purpose of this Perspective is to appraise synthetic access to complex peptides, particularly those containing unnatural \xce\xb1-amino amides. Several case studies in complex peptide synthesis are summarized here, each selected to characterize the challenges attendant to unnatural \xce\xb1-amino amide synthesis. As peptidic molecules find increasing value in therapeutic development, especially in clinical applications, their impact will ultimately be determined by efficient preparative methods."
"The polarization switching mechanism is used in various devices such as pyroelectric sensors and memory devices. The change in polarization mostly occurs by ion displacement. The development of materials whose polarization switches via electron transfer in order to enhance operation speed is a challenge. We devised a synthetic and crystal engineering strategy that enables the selective synthesis of a [CrCo] heterometallic dinuclear complex with a polar crystal structure, wherein polarization changes stem from intramolecular charge transfer between Co and the ligand. Polarization can be modulated both by visible-light irradiation and temperature change. The introduction of chiral ligands was paramount to the successful polarization switching in the valence tautomeric compound. Mixing Cr and Co complexes with enantiopure chiral ligands resulted in the selective formation of only pseudosymmetric [CrCo] heterometallic complexes. Furthermore, the left-handed chiral ligands preferentially interacted with their right-handed counterparts, enabling molecules to form a polar crystal structure."
"Electrocatalytic activity of a water-soluble nickel complex, [Ni(DHMPE)2]2+ (DHMPE = 2-bis(di(hydroxymethyl)phosphino)ethane), for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at pH 1 is reported. The catalyst functions at a rate of \xe2\x88\xbc103 s\xe2\x80\x931 (kobs) with high Faradaic efficiency. Quantification of the complex before and after 18+ hours of electrolysis reveals negligible decomposition under catalytic conditions. Although highly acidic conditions are common in electrolytic cells, this is a rare example of a homogeneous catalyst for HER that functions with high stability at low pH. The stability of the compound and proposed catalytic intermediates enabled detailed mechanistic studies. The thermodynamic parameters governing electron and proton transfer were used to determine the appropriate reductants and acids to access the catalytic cycle in a stepwise fashion, permitting direct spectroscopic identification of intermediates. These studies support a mechanism for proton reduction that proceeds through two-electron reduction of the nickel(II) complex, protonation to generate [HNi(DHMPE)2]+, and further protonation to initiate hydrogen bond formation."
"5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) is an essential intermediate in the active DNA demethylation pathway. Here we report a new base-resolution method for measuring hmC by combining peroxotungstate-mediated oxidation and sequencing analysis. We reveal that an oxidized product of hmC, trihydroxylated thymine (thT), tolerated the incorporation of dATP as a substrate in the process of DNA polymerase elongation. By comparing the results of Sanger sequencing before and after the oxidation, we observed that hmC sites on single-stranded DNAs could be discriminated from unmethylated cytosines. We found that a thermal cycle condition during peroxotungstate treatment enhanced the oxidation reaction of hmC in double-stranded DNA. Furthermore, Illumina sequencing analysis of hmC-containing synthetic genome fragments enabled us to identify simultaneously the positions of hmC in base resolution. This bisulfite-free simple hmC detection technique could facilitate the acquisition of epigenomic information."
"Long, multifunctional sequence-defined oligomers were obtained on solid support from a protecting-group-free two-step iterative protocol, based on the inherent reactivity of a readily available molecule containing an isocyanate and a thiolactone. Aminolysis of the latter entity with an amino alcohol liberates a thiol that reacts with an acrylate or acrylamide, present in the same medium. Subsequently, a new thiolactone can be reinstated by means of an \xce\xb1-isocyanato-\xce\xb3-thiolactone. Different acrylic compounds were used to incorporate diverse functionalities in the oligomers, which were built up to the level of decamers. The reaction conditions were closely monitored in order to fine-tune the applied strategy as well as facilitate the translation to an automated protocol."
"Bubbling O2 into a THF solution of CoII(BDPP) (1) at \xe2\x88\x9290 \xc2\xb0C generates an O2 adduct, Co(BDPP)(O2) (3). The resonance Raman and EPR investigations reveal that 3 contains a low spin cobalt(III) ion bound to a superoxo ligand. Significantly, at \xe2\x88\x9290 \xc2\xb0C, 3 can react with 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-hydroxypiperidine (TEMPOH) to form a structurally characterized cobalt(III)-hydroperoxo complex, CoIII(BDPP)(OOH) (4) and TEMPO\xe2\x80\xa2. Our findings show that cobalt(III)-superoxo species are capable of performing hydrogen atom abstraction processes. Such a stepwise O2-activating process helps to rationalize cobalt-catalyzed aerobic oxidations and sheds light on the possible mechanism of action for Co-bleomycin."
"A new nonlinear optical (NLO) material, Bi3TeBO9 (BTBO), is successfully grown from high temperature solution method. BTBO crystallizes in a polar space group of P63 with a framework structure composed of [Bi3O9] blocks, with TeO6 and BO3 interconnection. It is interesting that in the BTBO structure three types of NLO-active units, including stereochemically active lone pair cations (Bi3+ cations), second-order Jahn\xe2\x80\x93Teller distorted octahedra (TeO6 octahedra) and \xcf\x80-orbital planar groups (BO3 groups), simultaneously exist. The additive contribution from these three types of groups results in an extremely large second harmonic generation (SHG) response in BTBO (about 20 times that of KDP), exhibiting the largest SHG effect among the known borate NLO materials. The enhancement of the nonlinear optical property is elucidated by the first-principles analysis."
"The first asymmetric synthesis of \xce\xb1,\xce\xb1-disubstituted allylic N-arylamines based on a palladium-catalyzed allylic amination has been developed. The protocol uses highly modular vinyl cyclic carbonates and unactivated aromatic amine nucleophiles as substrates. The catalytic process features minimal waste production, ample scope in reaction partners, high asymmetric induction up to 97% ee, and operational simplicity."
"A strategy for the highly efficient synthesis of 3(2H)-furanones by hydration of diyne alcohols catalyzed by base-functionalized ionic liquids under atmospheric-pressure CO2 that was developed through computer-assisted design is reported. The best range of basic ionic liquids as catalysts was predicted at first, and [HDBU][BenIm] exhibited the highest catalytic activity. Through a combination of NMR spectroscopic investigations and quantum-chemical calculations, the results indicated the importance of the basicity of the anion and the species of cation in the ionic liquid."
"Bright green emitters with adjustable photoluminescence (PL) maxima in the range of 530\xe2\x80\x93535 nm and full-width at half-maxima (fwhm) of <25 nm are particularly desirable for applications in television displays and related technologies. Toward this goal, we have developed a facile synthesis of highly monodisperse, cubic-shaped formamidinium lead bromide nanocrystals (FAPbBr3 NCs) with perovskite crystal structure, tunable PL in the range of 470\xe2\x80\x93540 nm by adjusting the nanocrystal size (5\xe2\x80\x9312 nm), high quantum yield (QY) of up to 85% and PL fwhm of <22 nm. High QYs are also retained in films of FAPbBr3 NCs. In addition, these films exhibit low thresholds of 14 \xc2\xb1 2 \xce\xbcJ cm\xe2\x80\x932 for amplified spontaneous emission."
"Blood-based biomarkers (liquid biopsy) offer extremely valuable tools for the noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of tumors. The protein c-MYC, a transcription factor that has been shown to be deregulated in up to 70% of human cancers, can be used as a robust proteomic signature for cancer. Herein, we developed a rapid, highly specific, and sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) assay for the quantification of c-MYC in real blood samples. The sensing scheme relies on the use of specifically designed hybrid plasmonic materials and their bioderivatization with a selective peptidic receptor modified with a SERS transducer. Peptide/c-MYC recognition events translate into measurable alterations of the SERS spectra associated with a molecular reorientation of the transducer, in agreement with the surface selection rules. The efficiency of the sensor is demonstrated in cellular lines, healthy donors and a cancer patient."
"The first catalytic enantioselective C\xe2\x80\x93C couplings of methanol (>30 \xc3\x97 106 tons/year) are reported. Insertion of 2-substituted dienes into the methanol C\xe2\x80\x93H bond occurs in a regioselective manner to form all-carbon quaternary centers with excellent levels of enantioselectivity using an iridium\xe2\x80\x93PhanePhos catalyst. Mechanistic studies corroborate a Curtin\xe2\x80\x93Hammett scenario in which methanol dehydrogenation triggers rapid, reversible diene hydrometalation en route to regioisomeric allyliridium\xe2\x80\x93formaldehyde pairs, yet single constitutional isomers are formed."
"Lasso peptides exist naturally in a threaded state as [1]rotaxanes, and we reasoned that lasso peptides cleaved in their loop region could serve as building blocks for catenanes. Mutagenesis of the lasso peptide microcin J25 (MccJ25) with two cysteine residues followed by cleavage of the peptide with trypsin led to a [2]rotaxane structure that self-assembled into a [3]catenane and [4]catenanes at room temperature in aqueous solution. The [3]catenane represents the smallest ring size of a catenane composed solely of polypeptide segments. The NMR structure of the [3]catenane was determined, suggesting that burial of hydrophobic residues may be a driving force for assembly of the catenane structure."
"We describe herein a new strategy for the chemoselective synthesis of amides by using a metal-catalyzed hydroxy-directed reaction. A hydroxy group located at the \xce\xb2-position of an ester group promoted the activation of a carbonyl group with a tantalum alkoxide catalyst followed by amidation reactions, leading to a wide variety of \xce\xb2-hydroxyamides with excellent chemeselectivity. The chemoselective amidation strategy can be extended to the catalytic synthesis of dipeptide derivatives, which remains challenging research subjects in modern organic synthesis."
"A copper-catalyzed C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93Si cross-coupling of aliphatic C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93I electrophiles using a Si\xe2\x80\x93B reagent as the silicon pronucleophile is reported. The reaction involves an alkyl radical intermediate that also engages in 5-exo-trig ring closures onto pendant alkenes prior to the terminating C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93Si bond formation. Several Ueno\xe2\x80\x93Stork-type precursors cyclized with excellent diastereocontrol in good yields. The base-mediated release of the silicon nucleophile and the copper-catalyzed radical process are analyzed by quantum-chemical calculations, leading to a full mechanistic picture."
"In this report, we describe the generation of remote allylic quaternary stereocenters \xce\xb2, \xce\xb3, and \xce\xb4 relative to a carbonyl in high enantioselectivity. We utilize a redox-relay Heck reaction between alkenyl triflates and acyclic trisubstituted alkenols of varying chain-lengths. A wide array of terminal (E)-alkenyl triflates are suitable for this process. The utility of this functionalization is validated further by conversion of the products, via simple organic processes to access remotely functionalized chiral tertiary acid, amine, and alcohol products."
"Several modified bases have been observed in the genomic DNA of bacteriophages, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes that play a role in restriction systems and/or epigenetic regulation. In our efforts to understand the consequences of replacing a large fraction of a canonical nucleoside with a modified nucleoside, we previously replaced around 75% of thymidine (T) with 5\xe2\x80\xb2-hydroxymethyl-2\xe2\x80\xb2-deoxyuridine (5hmU) in the Escherichia coli genome. In this study, we engineered the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway using T4 bacteriophage genes to achieve approximately 63% replacement of 2\xe2\x80\xb2-deoxycytidine (dC) with 5-hydroxymethyl-2\xe2\x80\xb2-deoxycytidine (5hmC) in the E. coli genome and approximately 71% replacement in plasmids. We further engineered the glucose metabolic pathway to transform the 5hmC into glucosyl-5-hydroxymethyl-2\xe2\x80\xb2-deoxycytidine (5-gmC) and achieved 20% 5-gmC in the genome and 45% 5-gmC in plasmid DNA."
"A concise route to a small family of exotic marine alkaloids known as the araiosamines has been developed, and their absolute configuration has been assigned. The dense array of functionality, high polarity, and rich stereochemistry coupled with equilibrating topologies present an unusual challenge for chemical synthesis and an opportunity for innovation. Key steps involve the use of a new reagent for guanidine installation, a remarkably selective C\xe2\x80\x93H functionalization, and a surprisingly simple final step that intersects a presumed biosynthetic intermediate. Synthetic araiosamines were shown to exhibit potency against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria despite a contrary report of no activity."
"Extremely weak protein\xe2\x80\x93protein interactions (PPIs), signified by micromolar or even millimolar dissociation constants, are one of the keys to understanding the rapid responses of cellular systems. Although single-molecule methods are particularly useful in determining kinetics of biological processes, their application is largely limited to rather strong interactions because of the diffraction-limited observation volume. In this study, we report a single-molecule method that allows the characterization of PPIs using a prey concentration 4 orders of magnitude lower than the dissociation constant. Instead of increasing the concentration of diffusing molecules, which is inevitably limited by the optical diffraction limit, we employed an increased density of surface bait protein. The low occupancy of the surface baits permitted determination of the kinetics with single-molecule resolution. We used this approach to study a PPI network consisting of Ras and its downstream proteins including full-length Rafs and catalytic subunits of phosphoinositide 3-kinase."
"We describe the incorporation of a bistable mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM) into a robust Zr-based metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework (MOF), NU-1000, by employing a post-synthetic functionalization protocol. On average, close to two bistable [2]catenanes can be incorporated per repeating unit of the hexagonal channels of NU-1000. The reversible redox-switching of the bistable [2]catenanes is retained inside the MOF, as evidenced by solid-state UV-vis-NIR reflectance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. This research demonstrates that bistable MIMs are capable of exhibiting robust dynamics inside the nanopores of a MOF."
"Diverse hydrogen-mediated C\xe2\x80\x93C couplings enable construction of the actin-binding marine polyketide swinholide A in only 15 steps (longest linear sequence), roughly half the steps required in two prior total syntheses. The redox-economy, chemo- and stereoselectivity embodied by this new class of C\xe2\x80\x93C couplings are shown to evoke a step-change in efficiency."
"Cobalamins are of widespread importance in biology. Both of the cofactors essential for human metabolism, the organocobalamins coenzyme B12 and methylcobalamin, are highly photolabile, as are other alkylcobalamins. The alkynylcobalamin phenylethynylcobalamin (PhEtyCbl) and the arylcobalamin 4-ethylphenylcobalamin (EtPhCbl) with \xe2\x80\x9catypical\xe2\x80\x9d Co\xe2\x80\x93C-bonds to unsaturated carbons, were recently designed as metabolically inert cobalamins, classified as \xe2\x80\x9cantivitamins B12\xe2\x80\x9d. The further development of an ideal light-activated or \xe2\x80\x9cconditional\xe2\x80\x9d antivitamin B12 would require it to be readily converted by light into an active B12 vitamin form. Very photolabile \xe2\x80\x9cantivitamins B12\xe2\x80\x9d would also represent particularly useful scaffolds for therapeutic light-activated reagents. Here, the photoactive arylcobalamin EtPhCbl and the remarkably photostable alkynylcobalamin PhEtyCbl are examined using femtosecond to picosecond UV\xe2\x80\x93visible transient absorption spectroscopy. PhEtyCbl undergoes internal conversion to the ground state with near unit quantum yield on a time scale < 100 ps and an activation energy of 12.6 \xc2\xb1 1.4 kJ/mol. The arylcobalamin EtPhCbl forms an excited state with a ca. 247 ps lifetime. This excited state branches between internal conversion to the ground state and formation of a long-lived base-off species with a quantum yield of \xe2\x88\xbc9%. Anaerobic steady state photolysis of \xe2\x80\x9clight-sensitive\xe2\x80\x9d EtPhCbl results in the formation of cob(II)alamin, but only with quantum yield <1%. Hence, our studies suggest that suitably modified arylcobalamins may be a rational basis for the design of photoresponsive \xe2\x80\x9cantivitamins B12\xe2\x80\x9d."
"Cryptic pockets, that is, sites on protein targets that only become apparent when drugs bind, provide a promising alternative to classical binding sites for drug development. Here, we investigate the nature and dynamical properties of cryptic sites in four pharmacologically relevant targets, while comparing the efficacy of various simulation-based approaches in discovering them. We find that the studied cryptic sites do not correspond to local minima in the computed conformational free energy landscape of the unliganded proteins. They thus promptly close in all of the molecular dynamics simulations performed, irrespective of the force-field used. Temperature-based enhanced sampling approaches, such as Parallel Tempering, do not improve the situation, as the entropic term does not help in the opening of the sites. The use of fragment probes helps, as in long simulations occasionally it leads to the opening and binding to the cryptic sites. Our observed mechanism of cryptic site formation is suggestive of an interplay between two classical mechanisms: induced-fit and conformational selection. Employing this insight, we developed a novel Hamiltonian Replica Exchange-based method \xe2\x80\x9cSWISH\xe2\x80\x9d (Sampling Water Interfaces through Scaled Hamiltonians), which combined with probes resulted in a promising general approach for cryptic site discovery. We also addressed the issue of \xe2\x80\x9cfalse-positives\xe2\x80\x9d and propose a simple approach to distinguish them from druggable cryptic pockets. Our simulations, whose cumulative sampling time was more than 200 \xce\xbcs, help in clarifying the molecular mechanism of pocket formation, providing a solid basis for the choice of an efficient computational method."
"Sialyl Thomsen-nouveau (STn) is a tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA) that is overexpressed in a variety of carcinomas such as breast, ovarian, and colon cancer. In normal tissue, STn is not detectable, which is critical for opportunities in developing cancer immunotherapies. A novel, entirely carbohydrate, semisynthetic STn-polysaccharide (PS) A1 conjugate was prepared and evaluated in C57BL/6 mice. STn-PS A1 was combined with commercially available monophosphoryl lipid A-based adjuvant, and after immunization, ELISA indicated a strong immune response for inducing anti-STn IgM/IgG antibodies. The specificity of these antibodies was concomitantly investigated using FACS analysis, and the results indicated excellent cell surface binding events to STn-expressing cancer cell lines MCF-7 and OVCAR-5. An INF-\xce\xb3 ELISpot assay was conducted to further confirm a robust cellular immunity invoked by STn-PS A1. Most importantly, the raised antibodies conferred complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and OVCAR-5 cells."
"Naively one might have expected an early division between phosphate monoesterases and diesterases of the alkaline phosphatase (AP) superfamily. On the contrary, prior results and our structural and biochemical analyses of phosphate monoesterase PafA, from Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, indicate similarities to a superfamily phosphate diesterase [Xanthomonas citri nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP)] and distinct differences from the three metal ion AP superfamily monoesterase, from Escherichia coli AP (EcAP). We carried out a series of experiments to map out and learn from the differences and similarities between these enzymes. First, we asked why there would be independent instances of monoesterases in the AP superfamily? PafA has a much weaker product inhibition and slightly higher activity relative to EcAP, suggesting that different metabolic evolutionary pressures favored distinct active-site architectures. Next, we addressed the preferential phosphate monoester and diester catalysis of PafA and NPP, respectively. We asked whether the >80% sequence differences throughout these scaffolds provide functional specialization for each enzyme\xe2\x80\x99s cognate reaction. In contrast to expectations from this model, PafA and NPP mutants with the common subset of active-site groups embedded in each native scaffold had the same monoesterase:diesterase specificities; thus, the >107-fold difference in native specificities appears to arise from distinct interactions at a single phosphoryl substituent. We also uncovered striking mechanistic similarities between the PafA and EcAP monoesterases, including evidence for ground-state destabilization and functional active-site networks that involve different active-site groups but may play analogous catalytic roles. Discovering common network functions may reveal active-site architectural connections that are critical for function, and identifying regions of functional modularity may facilitate the design of new enzymes from existing promiscuous templates. More generally, comparative enzymology and analysis of catalytic promiscuity can provide mechanistic and evolutionary insights."
"Heteronanocrystals consisting of a CdSe core and a giant CdS shell have shown remarkable optical properties which are promising for applications in opto-electrical devices. Since these properties sensitively depend on the size and shape, a morphological characterization is of high interest. Here, we present a high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) study of CdSe (core)/CdS (giant shell) heteronanocrystals. Electron tomography reveals that the nanocrystals have a bullet shape, either ending in a tip or a small dip, and that the CdSe core is positioned closer to the tip (or dip) than to the hexagonal base. Based on a high resolution HAADF-STEM study, we were able to determine all the surface facets. We present a heuristic model for the different growth stages of the CdS crystal around the CdSe core."
"FeIII-(hydro)peroxy intermediates have been isolated in two classes of mononuclear nonheme Fe enzymes that are important in bioremediation: the Rieske dioxygenases and the extradiol dioxygenases. The binding mode and protonation state of the peroxide moieties in these intermediates are not well-defined, due to a lack of vibrational structural data. Nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) is an important technique for obtaining vibrational information on these and other intermediates, as it is sensitive to all normal modes with Fe displacement. Here, we present the NRVS spectra of side-on FeIII-peroxy and end-on FeIII-hydroperoxy model complexes and assign these spectra using calibrated DFT calculations. We then use DFT calculations to define and understand the changes in the NRVS spectra that arise from protonation and from opening the Fe\xe2\x80\x93O\xe2\x80\x93O angle. This study identifies four spectroscopic handles that will enable definition of the binding mode and protonation state of FeIII-peroxy intermediates in mononuclear nonheme Fe enzymes. These structural differences are important in determining the frontier molecular orbitals available for reactivity."
"Identifying small molecules that induce the disruption of constitutive protein\xe2\x80\x93protein interfaces is a challenging objective. Here, a targeted biophysical screening cascade was employed to specifically identify small molecules that could disrupt the constitutive, homodimeric protein\xe2\x80\x93protein interface within CK2\xce\xb2. This approach could potentially be applied to achieve subunit disassembly of other homo-oligomeric proteins as a means of modulating protein function."
"In biology, high valent oxo\xe2\x80\x93iron(IV) species have been shown to be pivotal intermediates for functionalization of C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds in the catalytic cycles of a range of O2-activating iron enzymes. This work details an electronic-structure investigation of [FeIV(O)(LNHC)(NCMe)]2+ (LNHC = 3,9,14,20-tetraaza-1,6,12,17-tetraazoniapenta-cyclohexacosane-1(23),4,6(26),10,12(25),15,17(24),21-octaene, complex 1) using helium tagging infrared photodissociation (IRPD), absorption, and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy, coupled with DFT and highly correlated wave function based multireference calculations. The IRPD spectrum of complex 1 reveals the Fe\xe2\x80\x93O stretching vibration at 832 \xc2\xb1 3 cm\xe2\x80\x931. By analyzing the Franck\xe2\x80\x93Condon progression, we can determine the same vibration occurring at 616 \xc2\xb1 10 cm\xe2\x80\x931 in the E(dxy \xe2\x86\x92 dxz,yz) excited state. Both values are similar to those measured for [FeIV(O)(TMC)(NCMe)]2+ (TMC = 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane). The low-temperature MCD spectra of complex 1 exhibit three pseudo A-term signals around 12\xe2\x80\xaf500, 17\xe2\x80\xaf000, and 24\xe2\x80\xaf300 cm\xe2\x80\x931. We can unequivocally assign them to the ligand field transitions of dxy \xe2\x86\x92 dxz,yz, dxz,yz \xe2\x86\x92 dz2, and dxz,yz \xe2\x86\x92 dx2-y2, respectively, through direct calculations of MCD spectra and independent determination of the MCD C-term signs from the corresponding electron donating and accepting orbitals. In comparison with the corresponding transitions observed for [FeIV(O) (SR-TPA)(NCMe)]2+ (SR-TPA = tris(3,5-dimethyl-4-methoxypyridyl-2-methy)amine), the excitations within the (FeO)2+ core of complex 1 have similar transition energies, whereas the excitation energy for dxz,yz \xe2\x86\x92 dx2-y2 is significantly higher (\xe2\x88\xbc12\xe2\x80\xaf000 cm\xe2\x80\x931 for [FeIV(O)(SR-TPA)(NCMe)]2+). Our results thus substantiate that the tetracarbene ligand (LNHC) of complex 1 does not significantly affect the bonding in the (FeO)2+ unit but strongly destabilizes the dx2-y2 orbital to eventually lift it above dz2. As a consequence, this unusual electron configuration leads to an unprecedentedly larger quintet\xe2\x80\x93triplet energy separation for complex 1, which largely rules out the possibility that the H atom transfer reaction may take place on the quintet surface and hence quenches two-state reactivity. The resulting mechanistic implications are discussed."
"\xce\xb1-Methylene-\xce\xb3-butyrolactone (MBL), a naturally occurring and biomass-sourced bifunctional monomer, contains both a highly reactive exocyclic C\xe2\x95\x90C bond and a highly stable five-membered \xce\xb3-butyrolactone ring. Thus, all previous work led to exclusive vinyl-addition polymerization (VAP) product P(MBL)VAP. Now, this work reverses this conventional chemoselectivity to enable the first ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of MBL, thereby producing exclusively unsaturated polyester P(MBL)ROP with Mn up to 21.0 kg/mol. This elusive goal was achieved through uncovering the thermodynamic, catalytic, and processing conditions. A third reaction pathway has also been discovered, which is a crossover propagation between VAP and ROP processes, thus affording cross-linked polymer P(MBL)CLP. The formation of the three types of polymers, P(MBL)VAP, P(MBL)CLP, and P(MBL)ROP, can be readily controlled by adjusting the catalyst (La)/initiator (ROH) ratio, which is determined by the unique chemoselectivity of the La\xe2\x80\x93X (X = OR, NR2, R) group. The resulting P(MBL)ROP is degradable and can be readily postfunctionalized into cross-linked or thiolated materials but, more remarkably, can also be fully recycled back to its monomer thermochemically. Computational studies provided the theoretical basis for, and a mechanistic understanding of, the three different polymerization processes and the origin of the chemoselectivity."
"Iron is essential for sustaining life, as its ability to cycle between multiple oxidation states is critical for catalyzing chemical transformations in biological systems. However, without proper regulation, this same redox capacity can trigger oxidative stress events that contribute to aging along with diseases ranging from cancer to cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite its importance, methods for monitoring biological iron bound weakly to cellular ligands\xe2\x88\x92the labile iron pool\xe2\x88\x92to generate a response that preserves spatial and temporal information remain limited, owing to the potent fluorescence quenching ability of iron. We report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of FRET Iron Probe 1 (FIP-1), a reactivity-based probe that enables ratiometric fluorescence imaging of labile iron pools in living systems. Inspired by antimalarial natural products and related therapeutics, FIP-1 links two fluorophores (fluorescein and Cy3) through an Fe(II)-cleavable endoperoxide bridge, where Fe(II)-triggered peroxide cleavage leads to a decrease in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the fluorescein donor to Cy3 acceptor by splitting these two dyes into separate fragments. FIP-1 responds to Fe(II) in aqueous buffer with selectivity over competing metal ions and is capable of detecting changes in labile iron pools within living cells with iron supplementation and/or depletion. Moreover, application of FIP-1 to a model of ferroptosis reveals a change in labile iron pools during this form of cell death, providing a starting point to study iron signaling in living systems."
"The significant contribution of conventional living polymerization to polymer science assures that living supramolecular polymerization will also lead to a variety of novel phenomena and applications. However, the monomer scope still remains limited in terms of the self-assembly energy landscape; a kinetic trap that retards spontaneous nucleation has to be coupled with a supramolecular polymerization pathway, which is challenging to achieve by molecular design. Herein, we report a rational approach to addressing this issue. We combined the supramolecular polymerization and photoisomerization processes to build the energy landscape, wherein the monomer can be activated/deactivated by light irradiation. In this way, the supramolecular polymerization and kinetic trap can be independently designed in the energy landscape. When the \xe2\x80\x9cdormant\xe2\x80\x9d monomer was activated by light in the presence of the seed of the supramolecular polymer, the \xe2\x80\x9cactivated\xe2\x80\x9d free monomer was polymerized at the termini of the seed in a chain-growth manner. As a result, we achieved supramolecular polymers with controlled lengths and a narrow polydispersity. Although photoisomerization has been extensively employed in supramolecular polymer chemistry, most studies have focused on the stimuli responsiveness. In this respect, the present study would provoke supramolecular chemists to revisit stimuli-responsive supramolecular polymer systems as potential candidates for devising living supramolecular polymerization."
"A highly enantioselective allylic C\xe2\x80\x93H alkylation reaction of allylarenes with pyrazol-5-ones has been established by the cooperative catalysis of a chiral palladium complex and chiral Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid to afford a wide spectrum of functionalized chiral N-heterocycles with an all-carbon quaternary stereogenic center in high yields and with high levels of enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee), wherein the chiral ligand and phosphoric acid showed synergistic effect on the control of stereoselectivity. In addition, a palladium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic C\xe2\x80\x93H alkylation of 1,4-pentadienes with pyrazol-5-ones has been realized to furnish highly functionalized pyrazol-5-ones in high enantioselectivities. In this case, the chiral ligand controls the stereoselectivity while the achiral Bronsted acid, 2-fluorobenzoic acid, turns out to be a better cocatalyst than the chiral phosphoric acid. The installation of electron-deficient substituents at 3,3\xe2\x80\xb2-positions of binaphthyl backbone of chiral phosphoramidites is actually beneficial to the allylic C\xe2\x80\x93H oxidation due to their survival in the presence of quinone derivative oxidants. These allylic C\xe2\x80\x93H alkylation reactions undergo smoothly under mild conditions and tolerate a wide range of substrates. The resultant highly functionalized chiral pyrazol-5-ones have been applied to the preparation of more structurally diverse heterocycles by classical transformations."
"Two metastable NiIII complexes, [NiIII(OAc)(L)] and [NiIII(ONO2)(L)] (L = N,N\xe2\x80\xb2-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-2,6-pyridinedicarboxamidate, OAc = acetate), were prepared, adding to the previously prepared [NiIII(OCO2H)(L)], with the purpose of probing the properties of terminal late-transition metal oxidants. These high-valent oxidants were prepared by the one-electron oxidation of their NiII precursors ([NiII(OAc)(L)]\xe2\x88\x92 and [NiII(ONO2)(L)]\xe2\x88\x92) with tris(4-bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate. Fascinatingly, the reaction between any [NiII(X)(L)]\xe2\x88\x92 and NaOCl/acetic acid (AcOH) or cerium ammonium nitrate ((NH4)2[CeIV(NO3)6], CAN), yielded [NiIII(OAc)(L)] and [NiIII(ONO2)(L)], respectively. An array of spectroscopic characterizations (electronic absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, X-ray absorption spectroscopies), electrochemical methods, and computational predictions (density functional theory) have been used to determine the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of these highly reactive metastable oxidants. The NiIII-oxidants proved competent in the oxidation of phenols (weak O\xe2\x80\x93H bonds) and a series of hydrocarbon substrates (some with strong C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds). Kinetic investigation of the reactions with di-tert-butylphenols showed a 15-fold enhanced reaction rate for [NiIII(ONO2)(L)] compared to [NiIII(OCO2H)(L)] and [NiIII(OAc)(L)], demonstrating the effect of electron-deficiency of the O-ligand on oxidizing power. The oxidation of a series of hydrocarbons by [NiIII(OAc)(L)] was further examined. A linear correlation between the rate constant and the bond dissociation energy of the C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds in the substrates was indicative of a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. The reaction rate with dihydroanthracene (k2 = 8.1 M\xe2\x80\x931 s\xe2\x80\x931) compared favorably with the most reactive high-valent metal-oxidants, and showcases the exceptional reactivity of late transition metal\xe2\x80\x93oxygen adducts."
"Metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks are a new class of heterogeneous catalysts in which molecular-level control over both the immediate and long-range chemical environment surrounding a catalytic center can be readily achieved. Here, the oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone is used as a model reaction to investigate the effect of a hydrophobic pore environment on product selectivity and catalyst stability in a series of iron-based frameworks. Specifically, expanded analogues of Fe2(dobdc) (dobdc4\xe2\x80\x93 = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) were synthesized and evaluated, including the biphenyl derivative Fe2(dobpdc) (H4dobpdc = 4,4\xe2\x80\xb2-dihydroxy-[1,1\xe2\x80\xb2-biphenyl]-3,3\xe2\x80\xb2-dicarboxylic acid), the terphenyl derivative Fe2(dotpdc) (H4dotpdc = 4,4\xe2\x80\xb3-dihydroxy-[1,1\xe2\x80\xb2:4\xe2\x80\xb2,1\xe2\x80\xb3-terphenyl]-3,3\xe2\x80\xb3-dicarboxylic acid), and three modified terphenyl derivatives in which the central ring is replaced with tetrafluoro-, tetramethyl-, or di-tert-butylaryl groups. Within these five materials, a remarkable 3-fold enhancement of the alcohol:ketone (A:K) ratio and an order of magnitude increase in turnover number are achieved by simply altering the framework pore diameter and installing nonpolar functional groups near the iron site. M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectroscopy, kinetic isotope effect, and gas adsorption measurements reveal that variations in the A:K selectivities arise from differences in the cyclohexane adsorption enthalpies of these frameworks, which become more favorable as the number of hydrophobic residues and thus van der Waals interactions increase."
"Interfacial engineering of the meso-TiO2 surface through a modified sequential deposition procedure involving a novel PbI2\xe2\x80\x93HMPA complex pretreatment is conducted as a reproducible method for preparing MAPbI3 based perovskite solar cells providing the highest efficiencies yet reported with the polymer HTM layer. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction depth profiling confirms the formation of a perovskite film with a PbI2-rich region close to the electron transport layer (ETL) due to the strong interaction of HMPA with PbI2, which successfully retarded the dissolution of the PbI2 phase when depositing the perovskite layer on top. These results are further confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy performed in a scanning transmission electron microscope, which reveals that the I/Pb ratio in samples treated with the complex is indeed reduced in the vicinity of the ETL contact when compared to samples without the treatment. The engineered interface leads to an average power conversion efficiency of 19.2% (reverse scan, standard deviation SD < 0.2) over 30 cells (best cell at 19.5% with high FF of 0.80)."
"The selective annulation reaction of alkynes with substrates containing inert C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds using cobalt as catalyst is currently a topic attracting significant interest. Unfortunately, the mechanism of this transformation is still relatively poorly understood, with little experimental evidence for intermediates, although an organometallic Co(III) species is generally implicated. Herein, we describe a rare example of the preparation and characterization of benchtop-stable organometallic aryl-Co(III) compounds (NMR, HRMS, XAS, and XRD) prepared through a C(sp2)\xe2\x80\x93H activation, using a model macrocyclic arene substrate. Furthermore, we provide crystallographic evidence of an organometallic aryl-Co(III) intermediate proposed in 8-aminoquinoline-directed Co-catalyzed C\xe2\x80\x93H activation processes. Subsequent insights obtained from the application of our new organometallic aryl-Co(III) compounds in alkyne annulation reactions are also disclosed. Evidence obtained from the resulting regioselectivity of the annulation reactions and DFT studies indicates that a mechanism involving an organometallic aryl-Co(III)-alkynyl intermediate species is preferred for terminal alkynes, in contrast to the generally accepted migratory insertion pathway."
"Rhenium diboride (ReB2), containing corrugated layers of covalently bonded boron, is a superhard metallic compound with a microhardness reaching as high as 40.5 GPa (under an applied load of 0.49 N). Tungsten diboride (WB2), which takes a structural hybrid between that of ReB2 and AlB2, where half of the boron layers are planar (as in AlB2) and half are corrugated (as in ReB2), has been shown not to be superhard. Here, we demonstrate that the ReB2-type structure can be maintained for solid solutions of tungsten in ReB2 with tungsten content up to a surprisingly large limit of nearly 50 atom %. The lattice parameters for the solid solutions linearly increase along both the a- and c-axes with increasing tungsten content, as evaluated by powder X-ray and neutron diffraction. From micro- and nanoindentation hardness testing, all of the compositions within the range of 0\xe2\x80\x9348 atom % W are superhard, and the bulk modulus of the 48 atom % solid solution is nearly identical to that of pure ReB2. These results further indicate that ReB2-structured compounds are superhard, as has been predicted from first-principles calculations, and may warrant further studies into additional solid solutions or ternary compounds taking this structure type."
"Criegee intermediates are produced in the ozonolysis of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the troposphere, and understanding their fate is a prerequisite to modeling climate-controlling atmospheric aerosol formation. Although some experimental and theoretical rate data are available, they are incomplete and partially inconsistent, and they do not cover the tropospheric temperature range. Here, we report quantum chemical rate constants for the reactions of stabilized formaldehyde oxide (CH2OO) and acetaldehyde oxide (syn-CH3CHOO and anti-CH3CHOO) with H2O and for their unimolecular reactions. Our results are obtained by combining post-CCSD(T) electronic structure benchmarks, validated density functional theory potential energy surfaces, and multipath variational transition state theory with multidimensional tunneling, coupled-torsions anharmonicity, and high-frequency anharmonicity. We consider two different types of reaction mechanisms for the bimolecular reactions, namely, (i) addition-coupled hydrogen transfer and (ii) double hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT). First, we show that the MN15-L exchange-correlation functional has kJ/mol accuracy for the CH2OO + H2O and syn-CH3CHOO + H2O reactions. Then we show that, due to tunneling, the DHAT mechanism is especially important in the syn-CH3CHOO + H2O reaction. We show that the dominant pathways for reactions of Criegee intermediates depend on altitude. The results we obtain eliminate the discrepancy between experiment and theory under those conditions where experimental results are available, and we make predictions for the full range of temperatures and pressures encountered in the troposphere and stratosphere. The present results are an important cog in clarifying the atmospheric fate and oxidation processes of Criegee intermediates, and they also show how theoretical methods can provide reliable rate data for complex atmospheric processes."
"Over the past years, fluorescent proteins (e.g., green fluorescent proteins) have been widely utilized to visualize recombinant protein expression and localization in live cells. Although powerful, fluorescent protein tags are limited by their relatively large sizes and potential perturbation to protein function. Alternatively, site-specific labeling of proteins with small-molecule organic fluorophores using bioorthogonal chemistry may provide a more precise and less perturbing method. This approach involves site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) into proteins via genetic code expansion, followed by bioorthogonal chemical labeling with small organic fluorophores in living cells. While this approach has been used to label extracellular proteins for live cell imaging studies, site-specific bioorthogonal labeling and fluorescence imaging of intracellular proteins in live cells is still challenging. Herein, we systematically evaluate site-specific incorporation of diastereomerically pure bioorthogonal UAAs bearing stained alkynes or alkenes into intracellular proteins for inverse-electron-demand Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder cycloaddition reactions with tetrazine-functionalized fluorophores for live cell labeling and imaging in mammalian cells. Our studies show that site-specific incorporation of axial diastereomer of trans-cyclooct-2-ene-lysine robustly affords highly efficient and specific bioorthogonal labeling with monosubstituted tetrazine fluorophores in live mammalian cells, which enabled us to image the intracellular localization and real-time dynamic trafficking of IFITM3, a small membrane-associated protein with only 137 amino acids, for the first time. Our optimized UAA incorporation and bioorthogonal labeling conditions also enabled efficient site-specific fluorescence labeling of other intracellular proteins for live cell imaging studies in mammalian cells."
"The growth of one metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework (MOF) on another MOF for constructing a heterocompositional hybrid MOF is an interesting research topic because of the curiosity regarding the occurrence of this phenomenon and the value of hybrid MOFs as multifunctional materials or routes for fine-tuning MOF properties. In particular, the anisotropic growth of MOF on MOF is fascinating for the development of MOFs possessing atypical shapes and heterostructures or abnormal properties. Herein, we clarify the understanding of growth behavior of a secondary MOF on an initial MOF template, such as isotropic or anisotropic ways associated with their cell parameters. The isotropic growth of MIL-68-Br on the MIL-68 template results in the formation of core\xe2\x80\x93shell-type MIL-68@MIL-68-Br. However, the unique anisotropic growth of a secondary MOF (MOF-NDC) on the MIL-68 template results in semitubular particles, and structural features of this unknown secondary MOF are successfully speculated for the first time on the basis of its unique growth behavior and morphological characteristics. Finally, the validation of this structural speculation is verified by the powder X-ray diffraction and the selected area electron diffraction studies. The results suggests that the growth behavior and morphological features of MOFs should be considered to be important factors for understanding the MOFs\xe2\x80\x99 structures."
"We report a highly robust, general and stereoselective method for the synthesis of 3-(chloromethylene)oxindoles from alkyne-tethered carbamoyl chlorides using PdCl2(PhCN)2 as the catalyst. The transformation involves a stereo- and regioselective chloropalladation of an internal alkyne to generate a nucleophilic vinyl PdII species, which then undergoes an intramolecular cross-coupling with a carbamoyl chloride. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, is insensitive to the presence of moisture and air, and is readily scalable. The products obtained from this reaction are formed with >95:5 Z:E selectivity in nearly all cases and can be used to access biologically relevant oxindole cores. Through combined experimental and computational studies, we provide insight into stereo- and regioselectivity of the chloropalladation step, as well as the mechanism for the C\xe2\x80\x93C bond forming process. Calculations provide support for a mechanism involving oxidative addition into the carbamoyl chloride bond to generate a high valent PdIV species, which then undergoes facile C\xe2\x80\x93C reductive elimination to form the final product. Overall, the transformation constitutes a formal PdII-catalyzed intramolecular alkyne chlorocarbamoylation reaction."
"Catalytic activity for acyl transfer from N-acetylimidazole (NAI) to different pyridylcarbinol (PC) regioisomers (2-PC, 3-PC, and 4-PC) is demonstrated for a set of topologically diverse, zirconium-based (porphinato)zinc metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs). The MOFs studied are PCN-222, MOF-525, and NU-902, which are based on the csq, ftw, and scu topologies, respectively. The experimentally obtained reaction kinetics are discussed in light of molecular modeling results. The catalytic activity is shown to vary across the series of MOFs due to the different extent to which each topology facilitates reactant preconcentration and alignment of PC and NAI via coordination to framework porphyrin sites (orientation effects). Trends of experimental initial reaction rates with MOF topology and PC regioisomer are consistent with preconcentration effects, which depend on the number of porphyrin sites per volume of MOF, as well as with orientation effects, which depend on the number of porphyrin pairs per volume of MOF that bind PC and NAI in such a way that they are primed to form the required transition state. The present work shows how the proper alignment of catalytic linkers can enhance reaction rates in MOFs."
"Thermoelectrics directly converts waste heat into electricity and is considered a promising means of sustainable energy generation. While most of the recent advances in the enhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) resulted from a decrease in lattice thermal conductivity by nanostructuring, there have been very few attempts to enhance electrical transport properties, i.e., the power factor. Here we use nanochemistry to stabilize bulk bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) that violates phase equilibrium, namely, phase-pure n-type K0.06Bi2Te3.18. Incorporated potassium and tellurium in Bi2Te3 far exceed their solubility limit, inducing simultaneous increase in the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient along with decrease in the thermal conductivity. Consequently, a high power factor of \xe2\x88\xbc43 \xce\xbcW cm\xe2\x80\x931 K\xe2\x80\x932 and a high ZT > 1.1 at 323 K are achieved. Our current synthetic method can be used to produce a new family of materials with novel physical and chemical characteristics for various applications."
"Solid-state superstructures, resulting from assemblies programmed by homochirality, are attracting considerable attention. In addition, artificial double-helical architectures are being investigated, especially in relation to the ways in which homochiral small molecules can be induced to yield helical forms as a result of chiral induction. Herein, we report the highly specific self-assembly upon crystallization of a double-helical superstructure from an enantiopure macrocyclic dimer which adopts two diastereoisomeric conformations in a molar ratio of 1.5:1 in dimethyl sulfoxide. These two conformational diastereoisomers self-organize\xe2\x80\x94and self-sort\xe2\x80\x94in the crystalline phase in equimolar proportions to form two single-handed helices which are complementary to each other, giving rise to the assembly of a double helix that is stabilized by intermolecular [C\xe2\x80\x93H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O] and \xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93\xcf\x80 stacking interactions. The observed self-sorting phenomenon occurs on going from a mixed-solvent system containing two equilibrating conformational diastereoisomers, presumably present in unequal molar proportions, into the solid state. The diastereoisomeric conformations are captured upon crystallization in a 1:1 molar ratio in the double-helical superstructure, whose handedness is dictated by the choice of the enantiomeric macrocyclic dimer. The interconversion of the two conformational diastereoisomers derived from each configurationally enantiomeric macrocycle was investigated in CD3SOCD3 solution by variable-temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy (VT NMR) and circular dichroism (VT CD). The merging of the resonances for the protons corresponding to the two diastereoisomers at a range of coalescence temperatures in the VT NMR spectra and occurrence of the isosbestic points in the VT CD spectra indicate that the two diastereoisomers are interconverting slowly in solution on the 1H NMR time scale but rapidly on the laboratory time scale. To the best of our knowledge, the self-assembly of such solid-state superstructures from two conformational diastereoisomers of a homochiral macrocycle is a rare, if not unique, occurrence."
"Both in vivo and ex vivo observations support the hypothesis that bone mineral formation proceeds via disordered precursor phases. The characteristics of the precursor phases are not well defined, but octacalcium phosphate-like, amorphous calcium phosphate-like, and HPO42\xe2\x80\x93-enriched phases were detected. Here we use in vivo Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) to characterize and map at 2 \xce\xbcm resolution the mineral phases in the rapidly forming tail fin bones of living zebrafish larvae and zebrafish larvae immediately after sacrifice, respectively. Raman spectroscopy shows the presence of an acidic disordered calcium phosphate phase with additional characteristic features of HPO42\xe2\x80\x93 at the bone\xe2\x80\x93cell interface. The complexity in the position and shape of the \xce\xbd1 PO4 peak viewed by in vivo Raman spectroscopy emphasizes the heterogeneity of the mineral during bone formation. WAXD detects an additional isolated peak, appearing alone or together with the characteristic diffraction pattern of carbonated hydroxyapatite. This unidentified phase is located at the interface between the mature bone and the surrounding tissue, similar to the location at which the disordered phase was observed by Raman spectroscopy. The variable peak positions and profiles support the notion that this is an unstable disordered precursor phase, which conceivably crystallized during the X-ray diffraction measurement. Interestingly, this precursor phase is co-aligned with the c-axes of the mature bone crystals and thus is in intimate relation with the surrounding collagen matrix. We conclude that a major disordered precursor mineral phase containing HPO42\xe2\x80\x93 is part of the deposition pathway of the rapidly forming tail fin bones of the zebrafish."
"Self-assembly of ligand 1 and Pd(NO3)2 delivers Fujita-type metal\xe2\x80\x93organic polyhedron (MOP) 3 which bears 24 covalently attached methyl viologen units on its external surface, as evidenced by 1H NMR, diffusion-ordered spectroscopy NMR, electrospray mass spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy measurements. MOP 3 undergoes noncovalent complexation with cucurbit[n]urils to yield MOPs 4\xe2\x80\x936 with diameter \xe2\x89\x885\xe2\x80\x936 nm. MOP 5 can be fully loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) prodrug 2 via hetero\xe2\x80\x93ternary complex formation to yield 7. The MOPs exhibit excellent stability toward neutral to slightly acidic pH in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, mitigating the concern of disassembly during circulation. The results of MTS assays show that MOP 7 is 10-fold more cytotoxic toward HeLa cells than equimolar quantities of DOX prodrug 2. The enhanced cytotoxicity can be traced to a combination of enhanced cellular uptake of 7 and DOX release as demonstrated by flow cytometry and confocal fluorescence microscopy. The confluence of properties imparted by the polycationic MOP architecture and plug-and-play CB[n] complexation provides a potent new platform for drug delivery application."
"Racemic or quasi-racemic crystallography recently emerges as a useful technology for solution of the crystal structures of biomacromolecules. It remains unclear to what extent the biomacromolecules of opposite handedness can differ from each other in racemic or quasi-racemic crystallography. Here we report a finding that monomeric d-ubiquitin (Ub) has propensity to cocrystallize with different dimers, trimers, and even a tetramer of l-Ub. In these cocrystals the unconnected monomeric d-Ubs can self-assemble to form pseudomirror images of different oligomers of l-Ub. This monomer/oligomer cocrystallization phenomenon expands the concept of racemic crystallography. Using the monomer/oligomer cocrystallization technology we obtained, for the first time the X-ray structures of linear M1-linked tri- and tetra-Ubs and a K11/K63-branched tri-Ub."
"Sakakura and Tanaka have recently developed an alkane carbonylation process with the Vaska type complex Rh(PR3)2Cl(CO) (1) as the (pre)catalyst. We have previously studied the initial steps of the alkane carbonylation process involving C\xe2\x88\x92H activation. Here, we present density functional calculations on the remaining part of the catalytic cycle. This part involves migratory insertion of CO into the Rh\xe2\x88\x92CH3 bond of Rh(PH3)2Cl(H)(CH3)(CO) (6), generating the rhodium acyl Rh(PH3)2Cl(H)(CH3CO) (11), and further the addition of another CO molecule to 11, yielding Rh(PH3)2Cl(CO)(H)(CH3CO) (12). Finally, acetaldehyde is eliminated from 12 to regenerate 1. The present investigation combines \xe2\x80\x9cstatic\xe2\x80\x9d calculations of the stationary points on the potential surface with first principles molecular dynamics calculations based on the Car-Parrinello-Projector-Augmented-Wave method. We find that the rate limiting step in the carbonylation of methane is the migratory insertion of coordinated CO into the Rh\xe2\x88\x92CH3 bond, 6 \xe2\x86\x92 11, with a barrier of 129 (trans) and 114 kJ/mol (cis), respectively, whereas the reductive elimination of methane from 6 has a lower calculated barrier of 72 (trans) and 57 kJ/mol (cis) according to our previous work. Therefore, the carbonylation will be seriously retarded by the concurrent reductive alkane elimination. We find that the overall productivity of the methane carbonylation process is determined by the migratory insertion step. "
"Nanocrystalline films of TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 were used as hosts for the merocyanine 3-acetyl-5-(2-(3-ethyl-2-benzothiazolidinylidene)ethylidene)rhodanine (Mc2) to scrutinize templating effects in the accommodation of the dye within their porous network. Composed of interconnected mesoscopic oxide particles and pores, these films are transparent, allowing for a straightforward application of transmission spectroscopy to unravel the optical features of the incorporated dye species. Apart from H-aggregation, the formation of two different types of two-dimensional assemblies was witnessed yielding red-shifted absorption bands which were identified as J-aggregates, one showing Davidov splitting, the other having a single exciton band. The herringbone packing of the dye molecules in the layered structure of Mc2 sodium salt octahydrate single crystals was taken to model the double-banded J-aggregate structure. On mesoscopic hydroxylated TiO2 anatase films, the structure of the Mc2 assemblies is controlled by the texture of the highly porous substrates as well as their surface charge. Furthermore, it responds in a striking fashion to the presence of solvent in the ambient to which the films are exposed. Double-banded (herringbone structure) and single-banded (parallel alignment of the dye) absorption spectra can thus be obtained. The role of solvent is to stabilize one particular aggregate geometry through intercalation into the Mc2 aggregate. Electron injection into TiO2 from both types of J-aggregates is observed. Laser flash photolysis experiments show that energy transfer from the monomer to the J-aggregate is operative prior to charge injection. On hydroxylated Al2O3 and ZrO2 surfaces Mc2 undergoes physisorption and formation of H-aggregates exhibiting a blue-shifted absorption with regard to the monomer spectrum. Contrary to the results obtained for TiO2 substrates, aggregation is hardly influenced by solvent in the ambient. In particular no J-aggregates can be formed on bare Al2O3 and ZrO2 substrates. However, when the porous films are impregnated with concentrated hydroxide solutions, H- as well as J-aggregates are formed in humid air. At high humidity, due to the hygroscopic salt coating, the pores are completely filled with water, leading to the precipitation of the dye molecules forming H-aggregates. At lower humidity an air\xe2\x88\x92water interface builds up within the pores and a double-banded J-aggregate spectrum appears. The spectrum is almost identical to the one measured on Mc2 sodium salt octahydrate single crystals with a layered organic\xe2\x88\x92inorganic structure. Resonance fluorescence originating from the energetically lower exciton band and internal conversion from the higher to the lower exciton band take place. "
"A water soluble \xce\xb2-cyclodextrin (CD-NA) bearing seven naphthoyl chromophores forms very stable 1:1 complexes with a merocyanine laser dye DCM-OH (4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(p-(bis(hydroxyethyl)amino)styryl)-4H-pyran). The antenna effect, i.e. energy transfer from the naphthoyl antenna chromomophores to the encased dye, is shown to occur with 100% efficiency. The stability of the complexes is very high (Ks \xe2\x89\x88 105) owing to the contribution of the naphthoate residues. The structural features of the complexes have been examined in detail:\xe2\x80\x89 circular dichroism experiments confirm the expected axial orientation of DCM-OH in the cavity of CD-NA, and fluorescence anisotropy measurements together with 13C-NMR longitudinal relaxation time measurements show that the complex formed between CD-NA and DCM-OH is tight. The mechanisms of homotransfer (i.e., between naphthoate chromophores) and heterotransfer (i.e., from naphthoate chromophores to DCM-OH included in the cavity) are discussed in light of existing theories. In both cases, the major contribution arises more likely from Coulombic interaction than from short-range interactions. Such multichromophoric cyclodextrins are good models for mimicry of the antenna function in photosynthesis and show great promise as photochemical microreactors. "
"The mechanism of dioxygen reduction catalyzed by cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the respiration chain of aerobic organisms, has been investigated with time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy. Five oxygen isotope sensitive Raman bands have been identified for 16O2/18O2 intermediates at 571/544, 804/764, 356/342, 785/750, and 450/425 cm-1 in the order of appearance. The first and last ones, which have been assigned to the FeIIIO2- and FeIIIOH- stretching modes, respectively, are in general consensus, but the remaining three bands are currently under debate. This study establishes that the 804/764 cm-1 species is generated prior to the 785/750 cm-1 species, and the latter is not observed when we start from the mixed valence enzyme. Therefore, the enzyme oxidation state of the 804/764 cm-1 species is higher by one oxidative equivalent than that of the 785/750 cm-1 species, although both bands have been assigned to the FeO stretching mode. The excitation wavelength dependences of these two sets of Raman bands are distinctly different, suggesting that the electronic properties of the two hemes are quite different. We found that the conversion from the 804/764 cm-1 species to the 785/750 cm-1 species was significantly slower in D2O than in H2O, suggesting strong coupling between electron and vector proton transfers at this stage. Presumably, CuB at the binuclear site causes heterolytic cleavage of the OO bond, giving rise to an oxoiron in the FeV oxidation level of the enzyme with the 804/764 cm-1 bands, and the electron transfer to this oxoiron is accompanied by some protein conformational changes, which cause distortion of the oxoheme and thus appearance of the HisFeO bending Raman bands at 356/342 cm-1 and simultaneously active transport of protons.

Researchers propose that a previously unrecognized hydrogen bond may be the key to how polymerases catalyze the addition of new nucleic acids along a strand of DNA or RNA.
"The localized surface plasmon resonance of metal nanoparticles is the collective oscillation of electrons on particle surface, induced by incident light, and is a particle composition-, morphology-, and coupling-dependent property. Plasmonic engineering deals with highly precise formation of the targeted nanostructures with targeted plasmonic properties (e.g., electromagnetic field distribution and enhancement) via controlled synthetic, assembling, and atomic/molecular tuning strategies. These plasmonically engineered nanoprobes (PENs) have a variety of unique and beneficial physical, chemical, and biological properties, including optical signal enhancement, catalytic, and local temperature-tuning photothermal properties. In particular, for biomedical applications, there are many useful properties from PENs including LSPR-based sensing, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, metal-enhanced fluorescence, dark-field light-scattering, metal-mediated fluorescence resonance energy transfer, photothermal effect, photodynamic effect, photoacoustic effect, and plasmon-induced circular dichroism. These properties can be utilized for the development of new biotechnologies and biosensing, bioimaging, therapeutic, and theranostic applications in medicine. This Perspective introduces the concept of plasmonic engineering in designing and synthesizing PENs for biomedical applications, gives recent examples of biomedically functional PENs, and discusses the issues and future prospects of PENs for practical applications in bioscience, biotechnology, and medicine."
"Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects (1\xc2\xb0DKIE) on (kcat/KGA, M\xe2\x80\x931 s\xe2\x80\x931) for dianion (X2\xe2\x80\x93) activated hydride transfer from NADL to glycolaldehyde (GA) catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were determined over a 2100-fold range of enzyme reactivity: (X2\xe2\x80\x93, 1\xc2\xb0DKIE); FPO32\xe2\x80\x93, 2.8 \xc2\xb1 0.1; HPO32\xe2\x80\x93, 2.5 \xc2\xb1 0.1; SO42\xe2\x80\x93, 2.8 \xc2\xb1 0.2; HOPO32\xe2\x80\x93, 2.5 \xc2\xb1 0.1; S2O32\xe2\x80\x93, 2.9 \xc2\xb1 0.1; unactivated; 2.4 \xc2\xb1 0.2. Similar 1\xc2\xb0DKIEs were determined for kcat. The observed 1\xc2\xb0DKIEs are essentially independent of changes in enzyme reactivity with changing dianion activator. The results are consistent with (i) fast and reversible ligand binding; (ii) the conclusion that the observed 1\xc2\xb0DKIEs are equal to the intrinsic 1\xc2\xb0DKIE on hydride transfer from NADL to GA; (iii) similar intrinsic 1\xc2\xb0DKIEs on GPDH-catalyzed reduction of the substrate pieces and the whole physiological substrate dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The ground-state binding interactions for different X2\xe2\x80\x93 are similar, but there are large differences in the transition state interactions for different X2\xe2\x80\x93. The changes in transition state binding interactions are expressed as changes in kcat and are proposed to represent changes in stabilization of the active closed form of GPDH. The 1\xc2\xb0DKIEs are much smaller than observed for enzyme-catalyzed hydrogen transfer that occurs mainly by quantum-mechanical tunneling."
"The controllable isotropic thermal expansion with a broad coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) window is intriguing but remains challenge. Herein we report a cubic MZrF6 series (M = Ca, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Zn), which exhibit controllable thermal expansion over a wide temperature range and with a broader CTE window (\xe2\x88\x926.69 to +18.23 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x936/K). In particular, an isotropic zero thermal expansion (ZTE) is achieved in ZnZrF6, which is one of the rarely documented high-temperature isotropic ZTE compounds. By utilizing temperature-dependent high-energy synchrotron X-ray total scattering diffraction, it is found that the flexibility of metal\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7F atomic linkages in MZrF6 plays a critical role in distinct thermal expansions. The flexible metal\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7F atomic linkages induce negative thermal expansion (NTE) for CaZrF6, whereas the stiff ones bring positive thermal expansion (PTE) for NiZrF6. Thermal expansion could be transformed from striking negative, to zero, and finally to considerable positive though tuning the flexibility of metal\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7F atomic linkages by substitution with a series of cations on M sites of MZrF6. The present study not only extends the scope of NTE families and rare high-temperature isotropic ZTE compounds but also proposes a new method to design systematically controllable isotropic thermal expansion frameworks from the perspective of atomic linkage flexibility."
"The comparison of experimental and predicted kinetic isotope effects in the \xce\xb1-cleavage of alkoxy radicals is used here to judge the applicability of statistical rate theories. It is found that the governing rate theory and the statistical versus nonstatistical nature of the cleavage depend on the cleavage barrier and how much energy is imparted to the radical. The latter can then be controlled by changing the size of substituents in the system. With a large alkyl group substituent, the vibrational energy of the alkoxy radical is increased, but this energy is not statistically distributed, leading to a lower isotope effect than predicted by statistical theories. The observed isotope effect can be approximately rationalized using a semistatistical localized RRKM model."
"We describe the design and development of the first catalytic asymmetric vinylogous Prins cyclization. This reaction constitutes an efficient approach for highly diastereo- and enantioselective synthesis of tetrahydrofurans (THFs) and is catalyzed by a confined chiral imidodiphosphoric acid (IDP). Aromatic and heteroaromatic aldehydes react with various 3,5-dien-1-ols to afford 2,3-disubstituted THFs in excellent selectivity (d.r. > 20:1, e.r. up to 99:1). Aliphatic aldehydes react with similarly excellent results when a highly acidic imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) catalyst is used. With a racemic dienyl alcohol, the reaction proceeds via a kinetic resolution. DFT calculations suggest an explanation for unusually high stereoselectivity."
"Bond lengths between pairs of atoms in covalent molecules are generally predicted well by the sum of their respective covalent radii, such that there are usually only small variations in related compounds. It is, therefore, significant that we have demonstrated that the incorporation of appropriately sized linkers between carbon and a metal center provides a means to modulate the length and nature of a metal\xe2\x80\x93carbon interaction. Specifically, X-ray diffraction studies on a series of tris(1-methylimidazol-2-ylthio)methyl zinc complexes, [TitmMe]ZnX, demonstrate how the Zn\xe2\x80\x93C bond lengths are highly variable (2.17\xe2\x80\x932.68 \xc3\x85) and are up to 0.67 \xc3\x85 longer than the average value listed in the Cambridge Structural Database (2.01 \xc3\x85). Furthermore, density functional theory calculations on [TitmMe]ZnCl demonstrate that the interaction is very flexible, such that either increasing or decreasing the Zn\xe2\x80\x93C length from that in the equilibrium structure is associated with little energy change in comparison to that for other compounds with Zn\xe2\x80\x93C bonds."
"We report a facile nitrogenation/exfoliation process to prepare hybrid Ni\xe2\x80\x93C\xe2\x80\x93N nanosheets. These nanosheets are <2 nm thin, chemically stable, and metallically conductive. They serve as a robust catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction in 0.5 M H2SO4, or 1.0 M KOH or 1.0 M PBS (pH = 7). For example, they catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction in 0.5 M H2SO4 at an onset potential of 34.7 mV, an overpotential of 60.9 mV (at j = 10 mA cm\xe2\x80\x932) and with remarkable long-term stability (\xe2\x88\xbc10% current drop after 70 h testing period). They are promising as a non-Pt catalyst for practical hydrogen evolution reaction."
"Selective recognition of neutral hydrophilic molecules in water is a challenge for supramolecular chemistry but commonplace in nature. By mimicking the binding pocket of natural receptors, endo-functionalized molecular tubes are proposed to meet this challenge. We found that two molecular tubes with inwardly directed hydrogen-bond donors recognize highly hydrophilic solvent molecules in water with high selectivity. In the complexes, hydrogen bonding occurs in the deep and hydrophobic cavity. The cooperative action between hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effects accounts for the high affinity and selectivity. The molecular receptor is fluorescent and can detect concentrations of 1,4-dioxane\xe2\x80\x94a known carcinogen and persistent environmental contaminant\xe2\x80\x94in water at a limit of 119 ppb. The method simplifies the analytic procedure for this highly hydrophilic molecule."
"Pd(II)-catalyzed \xce\xb3-C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H arylation of primary amines is realized by using 2-hydroxynicotinaldehyde as a catalytic transient directing group. Importantly, the catalyst and the directing group loading can be lowered to 2% and 4% respectively, thus demonstrating high efficiency of this newly designed transient directing group. Heterocyclic aryl iodides are also compatible with this reaction. Furthermore, swift synthesis of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyridine derivatives is accomplished using this reaction."
A highly enantioselective synthesis of trisubstituted allenes has been achieved through Cu(I)-catalyzed cross-coupling of aryldiazoalkanes and terminal alkynes with chiral bisoxazoline ligands. Alkynyl migratory insertion of Cu(I) carbene is proposed as the key step for the construction of axial chirality.
"Colloidal crystallization can be programmed using building blocks consisting of a nanoparticle core and DNA bonds to form materials with controlled crystal symmetry, lattice parameters, stoichiometry, and dimensionality. Despite this diversity of colloidal crystal structures, only spherical nanoparticles crystallized with BCC symmetry experimentally yield single crystals with well-defined crystal habits. Here, we use low-symmetry, anisotropic nanoparticles to overcome this limitation and to access single crystals with different equilibrium Wulff shapes: a cubic habit from cube-shaped nanoparticles, a rhombic dodecahedron habit from octahedron-shaped nanoparticles, and an octahedron habit from rhombic dodecahedron-shaped nanoparticles. The observation that one can control the microscopic shape of single crystals based upon control of particle building block and crystal symmetry has important fundamental and technological implications for this novel class of colloidal matter."
"A concise synthesis of monobenzofused 1,4-azaborine phosphine ligands (Senphos) is described. These Senphos ligands uniquely support Pd-catalyzed trans-selective hydroboration of terminal and internal 1,3-enynes to furnish corresponding dienylboronates in high efficiency and diastereoselectivity. X-ray structural analysis of the Senphos\xe2\x80\x93Pd(0) complex reveals a \xce\xba2-P-\xce\xb72-BC coordination mode, and this isolated complex has been shown to serve as a competent catalyst for the trans-hydroboration reaction. This work demonstrates that the expanded chemical space provided by the BN/CC isosterism approach translates into the functional space in the context of stereoselective catalytic transformations."
"The inter- or intramolecular oxidative carboamination of alkynes catalyzed by [py2TiCl2NPh]2 is reported. These multicomponent reactions couple alkenes, alkynes and diazenes to form either \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated imines or \xce\xb1-(iminomethyl)cyclopropanes via a TiII/TiIV redox cycle. Each of these products is formed from a common azatitanacyclohexene intermediate that undergoes either \xce\xb2-H elimination or \xce\xb1,\xce\xb3-coupling, wherein the selectivity is under substrate control."
"The first example of polytypism in the I\xe2\x80\x93II\xe2\x80\x93V semiconductors has been demonstrated with the synthesis of cubic LiZnSb by a low-temperature solution-phase method. This phase exhibits a unique coloring pattern that is novel for this class of compounds. The choice of site configuration has a considerable impact on the band structure of these materials, which in turn affects the transport properties. While the hexagonal polytype has been suggested as a promising n-type and extremely poor p-type thermoelectric material, the cubic analogue is calculated to have high efficiencies for both the n- and p-type derivatives (1.64 and 1.43, respectively, at 600 K). Furthermore, the cubic phase is found to be the energetically favored polytype. This surprising result provides a rationale for the lack of success in synthesizing the hexagonal polytype in either stoichiometric or n-type compositions."
"Optically pure hinckdentine A was synthesized on a 300 mg scale via an asymmetric catalysis-based strategy. The key steps to the first asymmetric synthesis involved (i) enantioselective dearomative cyclization of an achiral N-acyl indole that allowed for the efficient construction of the key polycyclic indoline intermediate with a crucial tetrasubstituted stereogenic carbon center, (ii) Beckmann fragmentation-mediated ring expansion, (iii) rearrangement-based introduction of an anilinic nitrogen atom, (iv) regioselective tribromination, and (v) final closure of the cyclic amidine moiety."
"We have developed metal-free regiocontrolled dehydrogenative C\xe2\x80\x93H/C\xe2\x80\x93H cross-coupling of aryl sulfoxides with phenols by means of trifluoroacetic anhydride. Because the reaction would proceed through an interrupted Pummerer reaction followed by sulfonium-tethered [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, the C\xe2\x80\x93H/C\xe2\x80\x93H coupling takes place exclusively between the ortho positions of both substrates. Various functional groups including carbonyl, halo, siloxy, and even boryl moieties are compatible. The biaryl products naturally possess hydroxy and sulfanyl groups, which allows the products to be useful synthetic intermediates, as evidenced by the syntheses of \xcf\x80-expanded heteroarenes such as unprecedented 7,12-dioxa[8]helicene."
"Tissue penetration depth is a major challenge in practical photodynamic therapy (PDT). A biocompatible and highly effective near infrared (NIR)-light-absorbing carbazole-substituted BODIPY (Car-BDP) molecule is reported as a class of imaging-guidable deep-tissue activatable photosensitizers for PDT. Car-BDP possesses an intense, broad NIR absorption band (600\xe2\x80\x93800 nm) with a remarkably high singlet oxygen quantum yield (\xce\xa6\xce\x94 = 67%). After being encapsulated with biodegradable PLA\xe2\x80\x93PEG-FA polymers, Car-BDP can form uniform and small organic nanoparticles that are water-soluble and tumor-targetable. Rather than using laser light, such nanoparticles offer an unprecedented deep-tissue, tumor targeting photodynamic therapeutic effect by using an exceptionally low-power-density and cost-effective lamp light (12 mW cm\xe2\x80\x932). In addition, these nanoparticles can be simultaneously traced in vivo due to their excellent NIR fluorescence. This study signals a major step forward in photodynamic therapy by developing a new class of NIR-absorbing biocompatible organic nanoparticles for effective targeting and treatment of deep-tissue tumors. This work also provides a potential new platform for precise tumor-targeting theranostics and novel opportunities for future affordable clinical cancer treatment."
"The enzymatic polymerization of DNA and RNA is the basis for genetic inheritance for all living organisms. It is catalyzed by the DNA/RNA polymerase (Pol) superfamily. Here, bioinformatics analysis reveals that the incoming nucleotide substrate always forms an H-bond between its 3\xe2\x80\xb2-OH and \xce\xb2-phosphate moieties upon formation of the Michaelis complex. This previously unrecognized H-bond implies a novel self-activated mechanism (SAM), which synergistically connects the in situ nucleophile formation with subsequent nucleotide addition and, importantly, nucleic acid translocation. Thus, SAM allows an elegant and efficient closed-loop sequence of chemical and physical steps for Pol catalysis. This is markedly different from previous mechanistic hypotheses. Our proposed mechanism is corroborated via ab initio QM/MM simulations on a specific Pol, the human DNA polymerase-\xce\xb7, an enzyme involved in repairing damaged DNA. The structural conservation of DNA and RNA Pols supports the possible extension of SAM to Pol enzymes from the three domains of life."
"The gold-catalyzed direct functionalization of aromatic C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds has attracted interest for constructing organic compounds which have application in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other important fields. In the literature, two major mechanisms have been proposed for these catalytic reactions: inner-sphere syn-addition and outer-sphere anti-addition (Friedel\xe2\x80\x93Crafts-type mechanism). In this article, the AuCl3-catalyzed hydrofurylation of allenyl ketone, vinyl ketone, ketone, and alcohol substrates is investigated with the aid of density functional theory calculations, and it is found that the corresponding functionalizations are best rationalized in terms of a novel mechanism called \xe2\x80\x9cconcerted electrophilic ipso-substitution\xe2\x80\x9d (CEIS) in which the gold(III)-furyl \xcf\x83-bond produced by furan auration acts as a nucleophile and attacks the protonated substrate via an outer-sphere mechanism. This unprecedented mechanism needs to be considered as an alternative plausible pathway for gold(III)-catalyzed arene functionalization reactions in future studies."
"Photoaffinity labels are powerful tools for dissecting ligand\xe2\x80\x93protein interactions, and they have a broad utility in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. Traditional photoaffinity labels work through nonspecific C\xe2\x80\x93H/X\xe2\x80\x93H bond insertion reactions with the protein of interest by the highly reactive photogenerated intermediate. Herein, we report a new photoaffinity label, 2-aryl-5-carboxytetrazole (ACT), that interacts with the target protein via a unique mechanism in which the photogenerated carboxynitrile imine reacts with a proximal nucleophile near the target active site. In two distinct case studies, we demonstrate that the attachment of ACT to a ligand does not significantly alter the binding affinity and specificity of the parent drug. Compared with diazirine and benzophenone, two commonly used photoaffinity labels, in two case studies ACT showed higher photo-cross-linking yields toward their protein targets in vitro based on mass spectrometry analysis. In the in situ target identification studies, ACT successfully captured the desired targets with an efficiency comparable to the diazirine. We expect that further development of this class of photoaffinity labels will lead to a broad range of applications across target identification, and validation and elucidation of the binding site in drug discovery."
"N-BAR proteins such as endophilin are thought to bend lipid membranes via scaffolding (the molding of membranes through the crescent protein shape) and membrane insertion (also called wedging) of amphipathic helices. However, the contributions from these distinct mechanisms to membrane curvature generation and sensing have remained controversial. Here we quantitatively demonstrate that the amphipathic N-terminal H0 helix of endophilin is important for recruiting this protein to the membrane, but does not contribute significantly to its intrinsic membrane curvature generation capacity. These observations elevate the importance of the scaffolding mechanism, rather than H0 insertion, for the membrane curvature generation by N-BAR domains. Furthermore, consistent with the thermodynamically required coupling between curvature generation and sensing, we observed that the H0-truncated N-BAR domain is capable of sensing membrane curvature. Overall, our contribution clarifies an important mechanistic controversy in the function of N-BAR domain proteins."
"Oxygenation of aromatic rings using O2 is catalyzed by several non-heme carboxylate-bridged diiron enzymes. In order to provide a general mechanistic description for these reactions, computational studies were carried out at the ONIOM(B3LYP/BP86/Amber) level on the non-heme diiron enzyme benzoyl coenzyme A epoxidase, BoxB. The calculations revealed four possible pathways for attacking the aromatic ring: (a) electrophilic (2e\xe2\x80\x93) attack by a bis(\xce\xbc-oxo)-diiron(IV) species (Q pathway); (b) electrophilic (2e\xe2\x80\x93) attack via the \xcf\x83* orbital of a \xce\xbc-\xce\xb72:\xce\xb72-peroxo-diiron(III) intermediate (P\xcf\x83* pathway); (c) radical (1e\xe2\x80\x93) attack via the \xcf\x80*-orbital of a superoxo-diiron(II,III) species (P\xcf\x80* pathway); (d) radical (1e\xe2\x80\x93) attack of a partially quenched bis(\xce\xbc-oxo)-diiron(IV) intermediate (Q\xe2\x80\xb2 pathway). The results allowed earlier work of de Visser on olefin epoxidation by diiron complexes and QM-cluster studies of Liao and Siegbahn on BoxB to be put into a broader perspective. Parallels with epoxidation using organic peracids were also examined. Specifically for the BoxB enzyme, the Q pathway was found to be the most preferred, but the corresponding bis(\xce\xbc-oxo)-diiron(IV) species is significantly destabilized and not expected to be directly observable. Epoxidation via the P\xcf\x83* pathway represents an energetically somewhat higher lying alternative; possible strategies for experimental discrimination are discussed. The selectivity toward epoxidation is shown to stem from a combination of inherent electronic properties of the thioacyl substituent and enzymatic constraints. Possible implications of the results for toluene monooxygenases are considered as well."
"The study of intracellular metal ion compartmentalization and trafficking involved in cellular processes demands sensors with controllable localization for the measurement of organelle-specific levels of cations with subcellular resolution. We introduce herein a new two-step strategy for in situ anchoring and activation of a fluorescent Mg2+ sensor within an organelle of choice, using a fast fluorogenic reaction between a tetrazine-functionalized pro-sensor, Mag-S-Tz, and a strained bicyclononyne conjugated to a genetically encoded HaloTag fusion protein of known cellular localization. Protein conjugation does not affect the metal-binding properties of the o-aminophenol-N,N,O-triacetic acid (APTRA)-based fluorescent indicator, which displays a dissociation constant Kd = 3.1 mM suitable for the detection of low millimolar concentrations of chelatable Mg2+ typical of the intracellular environment. We demonstrate the application of our sensing system for the ratiometric detection of Mg2+ in target organelles in HEK 293T cells, providing the first direct comparison of subcellular pools of the metal without interfering signal from other compartments. Activation of the fluorescence in situ through a fluorogenic conjugation step effectively constrains the fluorescence signal to the locale of interest, thus improving the spatial resolution in imaging applications and eliminating the need for washout of mislocalized sensor. The labeling strategy is fully compatible with live cell imaging, and provides a valuable tool for tracking changes in metal distribution that to date have been an unsolved mystery in magnesium biology."
"The studies described in this paper show that hydrocarbon oligomers are alternatives for low molecular weight alkane solvents. These oligomeric solvents are nontoxic, nonvolatile, and recyclable alternatives to heptane in thermomorphic solvent mixtures that use a polar solvent such as methanol, aqueous ethanol, or DMF or in biphasic mixtures that use acetonitrile. Regardless of which polar solvent is used, hydrocarbon oligomers like poly(\xce\xb1-olefin)s (PAOs) exhibit very low leaching into the polar phase. UV\xe2\x80\x93visible spectroscopy studies show that these solvents have the solubility properties of heptane. For example, PAOs dissolve heptane soluble dyes and quantitatively separate them from polar phases in thermomorphic solvent mixtures. PAOs either as pure solvents or as additives in heptane act as antileaching agents, decreasing the already low leaching of such dyes into a polar phase in heptane/polar solvent mixtures. These oligomeric hydrocarbon solvents were also compared to heptane in studies of azo dye isomerization. The results show that thermal isomerization of an azo dye occurs at the same rate in heptane and a PAO. Further studies of carboxylic acid promoted dye isomerization in heptane and a PAO show that low molecular weight and oligomeric carboxylic acids are kinetically equivalent at accelerating this isomerization. The results suggest that these and other hydrocarbon oligomers behave as solvents like their low molecular weight nonpolar hydrocarbon solvents and that they can be substituted successfully for conventional solvents like heptane."
"The development of new catalysts for selective nitrene transfer is a continuing area of interest. In particular, the ability to control the chemoselectivity of intermolecular reactions in the presence of multiple reactive sites has been a long-standing challenge in the field. In this paper, we demonstrate examples of silver-catalyzed, nondirected, intermolecular nitrene transfer reactions that are both chemoselective and flexible for aziridination or C\xe2\x80\x93H insertion, depending on the choice of ligand. Experimental probes present a puzzling picture of the mechanistic details of the pathways mediated by [(tBu3tpy)AgOTf]2 and (tpa)AgOTf. Computational studies elucidate these subtleties and provide guidance for the future development of new catalysts exhibiting improved tunability in group transfer reactions."
"Sterically accessible Lewis donors are shown to accelerate decomposition during catalysis, for a broad range of Grubbs-class metathesis catalysts. These include benzylidene derivatives RuCl2(NHC)(PCy3)(\xe2\x95\x90CHPh) (Ru-2: NHC = H2IMes, a; IMes, b; H2IPr, c; IPr, d; H2ITol, e) and indenylidene complexes RuCl2(NHC)(PCy3)(\xe2\x95\x90C15H10) (NHC = H2IMes, Ru-2f; IMes, Ru-2g). All of these precatalysts form methylidene complex RuCl2(NHC)(\xe2\x95\x90CH2) Ru-3 as the active species in metathesis of terminal olefins, and generate RuCl2(NHC)(PCy3)(\xe2\x95\x90CH2) Ru-4 as the catalyst resting state. On treatment with a 10-fold excess of pyridine, Ru-4a and Ru-4b decomposed within minutes in solution at RT, eliminating [MePCy3]Cl A by net loss of three ligands (PCy3, methylidene, and one chloride), and a mesityl proton. In comparison, loss of A from Ru-4a in the absence of a donor requires up to 3 days at 55 \xc2\xb0C. The \xcf\x83-alkyl intermediate RuCl2(13CH2PCy3)(NHC) (py)2 resulting from nucleophilic attack of free PCy3 on the methylidene ligand was undetectable for the H2IMes system, but was spectroscopically observable for the IMes system. The relevance of this pathway to decomposition of catalysts Ru-2a\xe2\x80\x93g was demonstrated by assessing the impact of pyridine on the in situ-generated methylidene species. Slow initiation (as observed for the indenylidene catalysts) did not protect against methylidene abstraction. Importantly, studies with Ru-4a and Ru-4b indicated that weaker donors (THF, MeCN, DMSO, MeOH, and even H2O) likewise promote this pathway, at rates that increase with donor concentration, and severely degrade catalyst productivity in RCM, even for a readily cyclized substrate. In all cases, A was the sole or major 31P-containing decomposition product. For DMSO, a first-order dependence of decomposition rates on DMSO concentration was established. This behavior sends a warning about the use of phosphine-stabilized metathesis catalysts in donor solvents, or with substrates bearing readily accessible donor sites. Addition of pyridine to RuCl2(H2IMes)(PCy3)(\xe2\x95\x90CHMe) did not result in ethylidene abstraction, indicating that this decomposition pathway can be inhibited by use of substrates in which the olefin bears a \xce\xb2-methyl group."
"Quantum information processing (QIP) offers the potential to create new frontiers in fields ranging from quantum biology to cryptography. Two key figures of merit for electronic spin qubits, the smallest units of QIP, are the coherence time (T2), the lifetime of the qubit, and the spin\xe2\x80\x93lattice relaxation time (T1), the thermally defined upper limit of T2. To achieve QIP, processable qubits with long coherence times are required. Recent studies on (Ph4P-d20)2[V(C8S8)3], a vanadium-based qubit, demonstrate that millisecond T2 times are achievable in transition metal complexes with nuclear spin-free environments. Applying these principles to vanadyl complexes offers a route to combine the previously established surface compatibility of the flatter vanadyl structures with a long T2. Toward those ends, we investigated a series of four qubits, (Ph4P)2[VO(C8S8)2] (1), (Ph4P)2[VO(\xce\xb2-C3S5)2] (2), (Ph4P)2[VO(\xce\xb1-C3S5)2] (3), and (Ph4P)2[VO(C3S4O)2] (4), by pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and compared the performance of these species with our recently reported set of vanadium tris(dithiolene) complexes. Crucially we demonstrate that solutions of 1\xe2\x80\x934 in SO2, a uniquely polar nuclear spin-free solvent, reveal T2 values of up to 152(6) \xce\xbcs, comparable to the best molecular qubit candidates. Upon transitioning to vanadyl species from the tris(dithiolene) analogues, we observe a remarkable order of magnitude increase in T1, attributed to stronger solute\xe2\x80\x93solvent interactions with the polar vanadium-oxo moiety. Simultaneously, we detect a small decrease in T2 for the vanadyl analogues relative to the tris(dithiolene) complexes. We attribute this decrease to the absence of one nuclear spin-free ligand, which served to shield the vanadium centers against solvent nuclear spins. Our results highlight new design principles for long T1 and T2 times by demonstrating the efficacy of ligand-based tuning of solute\xe2\x80\x93solvent interactions."
"Application of transition metal phosphide (TMP) catalysts for full water splitting has great potential to help relieve the energy crisis. Various methods have been investigated to obtain high catalytic activity, but the use of electronic structure regulation by incorporation of different elements is of particular simplicity and significance for development of a universal TMP synthesis method. We herein describe a novel approach for fabricating a series of TMPs by pyrolyzing phytic acid (PA) cross-linked metal complexes. The introduction of oxygen atoms into TMPs not only enhanced their intrinsic electrical conductivity, facilitating electron transfer, but activated active sites via elongating the M\xe2\x80\x93P bond, favoring the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). MoP exhibited relative low HER overpotentials of 118 mV and 93 mV while supporting a current density of 20 mA\xc2\xb7cm\xe2\x80\x932 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes, respectively. When CoP was applied as a catalyst for OER, only 280 mV overpotential was required to reach current density of 10 mA\xc2\xb7cm\xe2\x80\x932. Additionally, PA-containing precursors enabled intimate embedding of TMPs onto a flexible substrate surface (carbon cloth), so that electron injection from substrate and transport to the active sites was facilitated. Remarkably, an alkaline electrolyzer was able to achieve a current density of 40 mA\xc2\xb7cm\xe2\x80\x932 at the low voltage of 1.6 V, demonstrating its potential for practical overall water splitting without the use of noble metals."
"Superconductivity was discovered in the layered compound RbBi11/3Te6, featuring Bi vacancies and a narrow band gap of 0.25(2) eV at room temperature. A sharp superconducting transition at \xe2\x88\xbc3.2 K was observed in polycrystalline ingots. The superconducting volume fraction of oriented single crystals is almost 100%, confirming bulk superconductivity. Systematic Se and Sb substitutions in RbBi11/3\xe2\x80\x93ySbySexTe6\xe2\x80\x93x revealed a dependence of the superconducting transition on composition that can increase the Tc up to \xe2\x88\xbc10%. The RbBi11/3Te6 system is the first member of the new homologous series Rb[Bi2n+11/3Te3n+6] with infinite Bi2Te3-like layers. The large degree of chemical tunability of the electronic structure of the homology via doping and/or substitution gives rise to a new family of superconductors."
We report a method that ensures the selective alkylation of benzamides and aromatic ketones at the para-position via cooperative nickel/aluminum catalysis. Using a bulky catalyst/cocatalyst system allows reactions between benzamides and alkenes to afford the corresponding para-alkylated products. The origin of the high para-selectivity has also been investigated by density functional theory calculations.
"Reactions that forge carbon\xe2\x80\x93carbon (C\xe2\x80\x93C) bonds are the bedrock of organic synthesis, widely used across the chemical sciences. We report a transformation that enables C\xe2\x80\x93C bonds to be constructed from two classes of commonly available starting materials, alkenes and carbon\xe2\x80\x93hydrogen (C\xe2\x80\x93H) bonds. The reaction employs a palladium(II) catalyst and utilizes a removable directing group to both control the regioselectivity of carbopalladation and enable subsequent protodepalladation. A wide range of alkenes and C\xe2\x80\x93H nucleophiles, including 1,3-dicarbonyls, aryl carbonyls, and electron-rich aromatics, are viable reaction partners, allowing Michael-type reactivity to be expanded beyond \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds to unactivated alkenes. Applications of this transformation in drug diversification and natural product total synthesis are described. Stoichiometric studies support each of the proposed steps in the catalytic cycle."
"Photoinduced interfacial charge transfer is at the heart of many applications, including photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and photodetection. With the emergence of a new class of semiconductors, i.e., monolayer two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs), charge transfer at the 2D/2D heterojunctions has attracted several efforts due to the remarkable optical and electrical properties of 2D-TMDs. Unfortunately, in 2D/2D heterojunctions, for a given combination of two materials, the relative energy band alignment and the charge-transfer efficiency are locked. Due to their large variety and broad size tunability, semiconductor quantum dots (0D-QDs) interfaced with 2D-TMDs may become an attractive heterostructure for optoelectronic applications. Here, we incorporate femtosecond pump\xe2\x80\x93probe spectroscopy to reveal the sub-45 fs charge transfer at a 2D/0D heterostructure composed of tungsten disulfide monolayers (2D-WS2) and a single layer of cadmium selenide/zinc sulfide core/shell 0D-QDs. Furthermore, ultrafast dynamics and steady-state measurements suggested that, following electron transfer from the 2D to the 0D, hybrid excitons, wherein the electron resides in the 0D and the hole resides in the 2D-TMD monolayer, are formed with a binding energy on the order of \xe2\x88\xbc140 meV, which is several times lower than that of tightly bound excitons in 2D-TMDs."
"Molybdenum(VI) oxide was deposited on the Zr6 node of the mesoporous metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework NU-1000 via condensed-phase deposition where the MOF is simply submerged in the precursor solution, a process named solvothermal deposition in MOFs (SIM). Exposure to oxygen leads to a monodisperse, porous heterogeneous catalyst, named Mo-SIM, and its structure on the node was elucidated both computationally and spectroscopically. The catalytic activity of Mo-SIM was tested for the epoxidation of cyclohexene. Near-quantitative yields of cyclohexene oxide and the ring-opened 1,2-cyclohexanediol were observed, indicating activity significantly higher than that of molybdenum(VI) oxide powder and comparable to that of a zirconia-supported analogue (Mo-ZrO2) prepared in a similar fashion. Despite the well-known leaching problem of supported molybdenum catalysts (i.e., loss of Mo species thus causes deactivation), Mo-SIM demonstrated no loss in the metal loading before and after catalysis, and no molybdenum was detected in the reaction mixture. In contrast, Mo-ZrO2 led to significant leaching and close to 80 wt % loss of the active species. The stability of Mo-SIM was further confirmed computationally, with density functional theory calculations indicating that the dissociation of the molybdenum(VI) species from the node of NU-1000 is endergonic, corroborating the experimental data for the Mo-SIM material."
"Engineering the surface ligands of metal nanoparticles is critical in designing unique arrangements of metal atoms. Here, we report the synthesis and total structure determination of a large box-shaped Ag67 nanocluster (NC) protected by a mixed shell of thiolate (2,4-dimethylbenzenethiolate, SPhMe2) and phosphine (triphenylphosphine, PPh3) ligands. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) revealed the cluster formula to be [Ag67(SPhMe2)32(PPh3)8]3+. The crystal structure shows an Ag23 metal core covered by a layer of Ag44S32P8 arranged in the shape of a box. The Ag23 core was formed through an unprecedented centered cuboctahedron, i.e., Ag13, unlike the common centered Ag13 icosahedron geometry. Two types of ligand motifs, eight AgS3P and eight bridging thiols, were found to stabilize the whole cluster. The optical spectrum of this NC displayed highly structured multiple absorption peaks. The electronic structure and optical spectrum of Ag67 were computed using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) for both the full cluster [Ag67(SPhMe2)32(PPh3)8]3+ and a reduced model [Ag67(SH)32(PH3)8]3+. The lowest metal-to-metal transitions in the range 500\xe2\x80\x93800 nm could be explained by considering the reduced model that shows almost identical electronic states to 32 free electrons in a jellium box. The successful synthesis of the large box-shaped Ag67 NC facilitated by the combined use of phosphine and thiol paves the way for synthesizing other metal clusters with unprecedented shapes by judicious choice of thiols and phosphines."
"The thymidine analogue DMAT was used for the first fluorescence-based study of direct, site-specific metal binding reactions involving unmodified nucleobases in duplex DNA. The fluorescence properties of DMAT-A base pairs were highly sensitive to mercury binding reactions at T-T mismatches located at an adjacent site or one base pair away. This allowed for precise determination of the local kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of T-HgII-T binding reactions. The on- and off-rates of HgII were surprisingly slow, with association rate constants (kon) \xe2\x89\x88 104\xe2\x80\x93105 M\xe2\x80\x931 s\xe2\x80\x931, and dissociation rate constants (koff) \xe2\x89\x88 10\xe2\x80\x934\xe2\x80\x9310\xe2\x80\x933 s\xe2\x80\x931; giving equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) = 8\xe2\x80\x9350 nM. In contrast, duplexes lacking a T-T mismatch exhibited local, nonspecific HgII binding affinities in the range of Kd = 0.2\xe2\x80\x932.0 \xce\xbcM, depending on the buffer conditions. The exceptionally high kinetic stabilities of T-HgII-T metallo-base pairs (half-lives = 0.3\xe2\x80\x931.3 h) perturbed dynamic processes including DNA strand displacement and primer extension by DNA polymerases that resulted in premature chain termination of DNA synthesis. In addition to providing the first detailed kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of site-specific T-HgII-T binding reactions in duplex DNA, these results demonstrate that T-HgII-T base pairs have a high potential to disrupt DNA metabolism in vivo."
"The heterodimerizing self-assembly between a phosphoric acid catalyst and a carboxylic acid has recently been established as a new activation mode in Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid catalysis. In this article, we present a comprehensive mechanistic investigation on this activation principle, which eventually led to its elucidation. Detailed studies are reported, including computational investigations on the supramolecular heterodimer, kinetic studies on the catalytic cycle, and a thorough analysis of transition states by DFT calculations for the rationalization of the catalyst structure\xe2\x80\x93selectivity relationship. On the basis of these investigations, we developed a kinetic resolution of racemic epoxides, which proceeds with high selectivity (up to s = 93), giving the unreacted epoxides and the corresponding protected 1,2-diols in high enantiopurity. Moreover, this approach could be advanced to an unprecedented stereodivergent resolution of racemic \xce\xb1-chiral carboxylic acids, thus providing access to a variety of enantiopure nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and to \xce\xb1-amino acid derivatives."
"The dynamics of photoexcited lead-free perovskite films, CH3NH3SnI3, were studied using broadband transient absorption and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Similar to its lead analogue CH3NH3PbI3, we show that free carrier (electrons and holes) recombination is also the dominant relaxation pathway in CH3NH3SnI3 films. The slow hot carrier relaxation time is 0.5 ps. Long carrier diffusion lengths for electrons (279 \xc2\xb1 88 nm) and holes (193 \xc2\xb1 46 nm) were obtained from fluorescence quenching measurements. We also show that SnF2 doping in the CH3NH3SnI3 film effectively increases the fluorescence lifetime up to 10 times and gives diffusion lengths exceeding 500 nm. These results suggest that the photophysics of CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite are as favorable as those of CH3NH3PbI3, demonstrating that it is a promising nontoxic lead-free replacement for lead iodide perovskite-based solar cells."
"The riddle of anomalous polar behavior of the centrosymmetric crystal of \xce\xb1-glycine is resolved by the discovery of a polar, several hundred nanometer thick hydrated layer, created at the {010} faces during crystal growth. This layer was detected by two independent pyroelectric analytical methods: (i) periodic temperature change technique (Chynoweth) at ambient conditions and (ii) contactless X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy under ultrahigh vacuum. The total polarization of the surface layer is extremely large, yielding \xe2\x89\x881 \xce\xbcC\xc2\xb7cm\xe2\x80\x932, and is preserved in ultrahigh vacuum, but disappears upon heating to 100 \xc2\xb0C. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate the formation of polar hydrated layers at the sub-microsecond time scale, however with a thickness of only several nanometers, not several hundred. This inconsistency might be reconciled by invoking a three-step nonclassical crystal growth mechanism comprising (i) docking of clusters from the supersaturated solution onto the evolving crystal, (ii) surface recognition and polar induction, and (iii) annealing and dehydration, followed by site-selective recrystallization."
"Clusterfullerenes are capable of entrapping a variety of metal clusters within carbon cage, for which the entrapped metal cluster generally keeps its geometric structure (e.g., bond distance and angle) upon changing the isomeric structure of fullerene cage, and whether the properties of the entrapped metal cluster is geometry-dependent remains unclear. Herein we report an unusual triangular monometallic cluster entrapped in fullerene cage by isolating several novel terbium cyanide clusterfullerenes (TbNC@C82) with different cage isomeric structures. Upon varying the isomeric structure of C82 cage from C2(5) to Cs(6) and to C2v(9), the entrapped triangular TbNC cluster exhibits significant distortions as evidenced by the changes of Tb\xe2\x80\x93C(N) and C\xe2\x80\x93N bond distances and variation of the Tb\xe2\x80\x93C(N)\xe2\x80\x93N(C) angle by up to 20\xc2\xb0, revealing that the geometric structure of the entrapped triangular TbNC cluster is variable. All three TbNC@C82 molecules are found to be single-ion magnets, and the change of the geometric structure of TbNC cluster directly leads to the alternation of the magnetic relaxation time of the corresponding TbNC@C82 clusterfullerene."
"Electrically conductive metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as a subclass of porous materials that can have a transformative effect on electronic and renewable energy devices. Systematic advances in these materials depend critically on the accurate and reproducible characterization of their electrical properties. This is made difficult by the numerous techniques available for electrical measurements and the dependence of metrics on device architecture and numerous external variables. These challenges, common to all types of electronic materials and devices, are especially acute for porous materials, whose high surface area make them even more susceptible to interactions with contaminants in the environment. Here, we use the anisotropic semiconducting framework Cd2(TTFTB) (TTFTB4\xe2\x80\x93 = tetrathiafulvalene tetrabenzoate) to benchmark several common methods available for measuring electrical properties in MOFs. We show that factors such as temperature, chemical environment (atmosphere), and illumination conditions affect the quality of the data obtained from these techniques. Consistent results emerge only when these factors are strictly controlled and the morphology and anisotropy of the Cd2(TTFTB) single-crystal devices are taken into account. Most importantly, we show that depending on the technique, device construction, and/or the environment, a variance of 1 or even 2 orders of magnitude is not uncommon for even just one material if external factors are not controlled consistently. Differences in conductivity values of even 2 orders of magnitude should therefore be interpreted with caution, especially between different research groups comparing different compounds. These results allow us to propose a reliable protocol for collecting and reporting electrical properties of MOFs, which should help improve the consistency and comparability of reported electrical properties for this important new class of crystalline porous conductors."
"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging class of porous crystalline polymers with broad potential applications. So far, the availability of three-dimensional (3D) COFs is limited and more importantly only one type of covalent bond has been successful used for 3D COF materials. Here, we report a new synthetic strategy based on dual linkages that leads to 3D COFs. The obtained 3D COFs show high specific surface areas and large gas uptake capacities, which makes them the top COF material for gas uptake. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the new 3D COFs comprise both acidic and basic sites, and act as excellent bifunctional catalysts for one-pot cascade reactions. The new synthetic strategy provides not only a general and versatile approach to synthesize 3D COFs with sophisticated structures but also expands the potential applications of this promising class of porous materials."
"The first syntheses of 13,14-didehydroxyisogarcinol (6) and garcimultiflorone A (5) stereoisomers are reported in six steps from a commercially available phloroglucinol. Lewis acid-controlled, diastereoselective cationic oxycyclizations enabled asymmetric syntheses of (\xe2\x88\x92)-6-epi-6 and (+)-30-epi-6. A similar strategy enabled production of the meso-dervied isomers (\xc2\xb1)-6,30-epi-6 and (\xc2\xb1)-6,30-epi-5. Finally, a convenient strategy for gram scale synthesis was developed utilizing diastereomer separation at a later stage in the synthesis that minimized the number of necessary synthetic operations to access all possible stereoisomers."
"Perylene bisimide derivatives (PBIs) are known to form only columnar or lamellar assemblies. There is no known example of a PBI self-assembling into a supramolecular sphere. Therefore, periodic and quasiperiodic arrays generated from spherical assemblies produced from PBIs are also not known. Here, a PBI functionalized at its imide groups with a second generation self-assembling dendron is reported to self-assemble into supramolecular spheres. These spheres self-organize in a body-centered cubic (BCC) periodic array, rarely encountered for self-assembling dendrons but often encountered in block copolymers. These supramolecular spheres also assemble into a columnar hexagonal array in which the supramolecular columns are unexpectedly and unprecedentedly made from spheres. At lower temperature, two additional columnar hexagonal phases consisting of symmetric and asymmetric tetrameric crowns of PBI are observed. Structural and retrostructural analysis via X-ray diffraction (XRD), molecular modeling, molecular simulation, and solid state NMR suggests that inversion of the symmetric tetrameric crowns at high temperature mediates their transformation into supramolecular spheres. The tetrameric crowns of PBIs are able to form an isotropic sphere in the cubic phase due to rapid molecular motion at high temperature, unobservable by XRD but demonstrated by solid state NMR studies. This mechanism of hierarchical self-organization of PBI into supramolecular spheres is most probably general and can be applied to other related planar molecules to generate new functions."
"The solid-state X-ray structure of Tp\xe2\x80\x98PtMe2H has been determined. This platinum(IV) hydride derivative is stable at room temperature and crystallizes in an orthorhombic cell (space group Pcmn, Z = 4, a = 8.1292(8) \xc3\x85, b = 13.3862(9) \xc3\x85, and c = 17.9670(16) \xc3\x85). The hydride ligand was not located. The complex was synthesized as one of a series of organometallic platinum(IV) derivatives with Tp\xe2\x80\x98 (Tp\xe2\x80\x98 = hydridotris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate) in the coordination sphere. These octahedral platinum(IV) Tp\xe2\x80\x98PtMe2X and Tp\xe2\x80\x98PtPh2X complexes were prepared by formal oxidation of platinum(II) intermediates ([K][Tp\xe2\x80\x98PtMe2] and [K][Tp\xe2\x80\x98PtPh2]) with electrophiles (HX, MeI, I2). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to determine the solid-state decomposition temperatures for these platinum(IV) organometallic complexes. "
"A new method for creating stable protein nanoparticles for technological and pharmaceutical innovations requires no denaturation, cross-linking, or additional surfactants."
"Defect engineering, at the core of the field of thermoelectric studies, serves as a scaffold for engineering the intrinsic electrons\xe2\x80\x99 and phonons\xe2\x80\x99 behaviors to tailor thermoelectric parameters through the direct impacts of band engineering and phonon engineering, which can modify electronic band structure and phonon transport behavior to enhance the power factor (PF = \xcf\x83S2) and reduce the lattice thermal conductivity (\xce\xbal). By virtue of the implementation of defect engineering, the past decades have witnessed great progress in thermoelectric research through synergistic optimization of the inter-correlated transport parameters, and substantial enhancement has been achieved in the performance of various thermoelectric materials. However, current established optimization strategies based on defect engineering are mainly focused on tuning the electronic and phonon structures, while modulation by additional degrees of freedom caused by defects has long been neglected. In this Perspective, we focus on our interest in the under-exploited aspects of defect engineering, which include defect-related spin effects, defect-mediated atom or charge migration effects, and defect-related interface effects. Through these new points of view, we hope to arouse intense attention to the overlooked parts of defect engineering and combine them with current optimization strategies from the perspective of multiple degrees of freedom modulation, to enable the full potential of defect engineering for boosting thermoelectric performance. Finally, based on the discussion herein and current achievements in thermoelectric research, some personal perspectives on the future of this field are also presented."
"Nature\xe2\x80\x99s biomaterials such as peptides and proteins represent a valuable source of highly defined macromolecules. Herein we developed a nanoparticle drug delivery system based on the assembly of surface-modified proteins that can be transferred into organic solvents and represent the structural material of the carrier system. The particles are prepared by an oil-in-water nanoemulsion technique without the need of additional denaturation or cross-linking steps for stabilization. We achieve the necessary lipophilic solubility switch of the protein material by high surface PEGylation under conservation of the native three-dimensional protein structure. This study focuses on lysozyme as model enzyme for the preparation of empty and doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles with an average diameter of 100 nm. The particles are stable in physiological buffers and only release their therapeutic payload into cancer cells after a time-dependent cellular uptake. We also transferred this approach to various proteins, exemplifying the universal applicability of our new preparation method for protein-based nanoparticles."
"Isosteric replacement of amide bond(s) of peptides with surrogate groups is an important strategy for the synthesis of peptidomimetics (pseudo-peptides). Triazole is a well-recognized bio-isostere for peptide bonds, and peptides with one or more triazole units are of great interest for different applications. We have used a catalyst-free and solvent-free method, viz., topochemical azide\xe2\x80\x93alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction, to synthesize pseudo-proteins with repeating sequences. A designed \xce\xb2-sheet-forming l-Ala-l-Val dipeptide containing azide and alkyne at its termini (N3-Ala-Val-NHCH2C\xe2\x89\xa1CH, 1) was synthesized. Single-crystal XRD analysis of the dipeptide 1 showed parallel \xce\xb2-sheet arrangement along the b-direction and head-to-tail arrangement of such \xce\xb2-sheets along the c-direction. This head-to-tail arrangement along the c-direction places the complementary reacting motifs, viz., azide and alkyne, of adjacent molecules in proximity. The crystals of dipeptide 1, upon heating at 85 \xc2\xb0C, underwent crystal-to-crystal polymerization, giving 1,4-triazole-linked pseudo-proteins. This TAAC polymerization was investigated by various time-dependent techniques, such as NMR, IR, DSC, and PXRD. The crystal-to-crystal nature of this transformation was revealed from polarizing microscopy and PXRD experiments, and the regiospecificity of triazole formation was evidenced from various NMR techniques. The MALDI-TOF spectrum showed the presence of pseudo-proteins >7 kDa."
"An amide-functionalized metal organic framework (MOF) material, MFM-136, shows a high CO2 uptake of 12.6 mmol g\xe2\x80\x931 at 20 bar and 298 K. MFM-136 is the first example of an acylamide pyrimidyl isophthalate MOF without open metal sites and, thus, provides a unique platform to study guest binding, particularly the role of free amides. Neutron diffraction reveals that, surprisingly, there is no direct binding between the adsorbed CO2/CH4 molecules and the pendant amide group in the pore. This observation has been confirmed unambiguously by inelastic neutron spectroscopy. This suggests that introduction of functional groups solely may not necessarily induce specific guest\xe2\x80\x93host binding in porous materials, but it is a combination of pore size, geometry, and functional group that leads to enhanced gas adsorption properties."
"Chemical reactivity is essential for functional modification of biomolecules with small molecules and the development of covalent drugs. The reactivity between a chemical functional group of a small molecule and that of a large biomolecule cannot be reliably predicted from the reactivity of the corresponding functional groups separately installed on two small molecules, because the proximity effect on reactivity resulting from the binding of the small molecule to the biomolecule is challenging to achieve by mixing two small molecules. Here we present a new strategy to determine the chemical reactivity of two functional groups in the context of close proximity afforded by proteins. The functional groups to be tested were separately installed at the interface of two interacting proteins in the format of amino acid side chains via the expansion of the genetic code. Reaction of the two functional groups resulted in covalent cross-linking of interacting proteins, readily detectable by gel electrophoresis. Using this strategy, we evolved new synthetases to genetically encode N\xce\xb5-fluoroacetyllysine (FAcK), an isosteric fluorine analogue of acetyllysine. We demonstrated that fluoroacetamide installed on FAcK, previously thought inert to biological functional groups, actually reacted with the thiol group of cysteine when in proximity. This strategy should be valuable for accurately evaluating chemical reactivity of small molecules toward large biomolecules, which will help avoid undesired side reactions of drugs and expand the repertoire of functional groups to covalently target biomolecules."
"The first catalytic dehydrative condensation of the benzylic C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds of toluene and p-xylene with aromatic aldehydes is reported herein. This protocol provides highly atom-economical access to stilbene and p-distyrylbenzene derivatives, whereby water is the sole byproduct. The reaction is based on the deprotonation\xe2\x80\x93functionalization of benzylic C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds through \xce\xb76-complexation of the arenes, which is realized for the first time using a catalytic amount of a transition metal activator. The key to the success of this method is the use of a sulfonamide anion as a catalyst component, which appears to facilitate not only the deprotonation of the benzylic C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds but also the formation of a C\xe2\x80\x93C bonds via an electrophilic tosylimine intermediate."
"\xce\xb2-Stereoselective mannosylation using donors bearing the 2,6-lactone moiety is described. In general, glycosylation is a nucleophilic substitution reaction between an alcoholic nucleophile and a sugar moiety containing a leaving group at the anomeric position. Owing to stereoelectronic effects, the reaction tends to proceed via an SN1 mechanism to afford \xce\xb1-glycosides. We found that the introduction of a 2,6-lactone bridge can circumvent the competing SN1 reaction, affording \xce\xb2-glycosides with stereoinversion via SN2(-like) mechanisms. Glycosyl trichloroacetimidates are particularly efficient when activated by a combined catalyst of AuCl3 and 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl thiourea. In addition, the product stereoselectivity was highly dependent on the concentration of the reaction. Moreover, even when the reaction proceeds via an SN1 mechanism, the corresponding glycosyl cation appears to present sterically a \xce\xb2-directing nature. Overall, 2,6-lactones were promising structures for achieving \xce\xb2-mannosylations."
"N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are becoming increasingly popular ligand frameworks for nanocrystal surfaces; however, as of yet the nature of the NHC\xe2\x80\x93nanocrystal interface remains unexplored across different material types. Here we report a facile synthetic route to NHC-stabilized metal and metal chalcogenide nanocrystals. It was observed that NHC\xe2\x80\x93Ag nanocrystals are colloidally stable, but much less so than the corresponding NHC\xe2\x80\x93Ag2E analogues. Comprehensive NMR studies suggest a dynamic NHC\xe2\x80\x93nanocrystal interface for both NHC\xe2\x80\x93Ag and NHC\xe2\x80\x93Ag2S; however, density functional theory calculations reveal a much stronger binding affinity of the NHC ligands to Ag2S compared with Ag nanocrystals, which explains the superior colloidal stability of the metal chalcogenides. This offers new insight into the surface chemistry of neutral L-type carbenes in colloidal nanocrystal chemistry."
"An enantioselective, catalytic aza-Sakurai cyclization of chlorolactams has been developed as an efficient entry into indolizidine and quinolizidine frameworks. Structure\xe2\x80\x93enantioselectivity relationship studies and mechanistic analysis point to a dual role of the catalyst wherein the thiourea moiety of the catalyst is engaged in both anion binding and Lewis base activation of a substrate."
"We report the dramatic triggering of structural order in a Zr(IV)-based metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework (MOF) through docking of HgCl2 guests. Although as-made crystals were unsuitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), with diffraction limited to low angles well below atomic resolution due to intrinsic structural disorder, permeation of HgCl2 not only leaves the crystals intact but also resulted in fully resolved backbone as well as thioether side groups. The crystal structure revealed elaborate HgCl2-thioether aggregates nested within the host octahedra to form a hierarchical, multifunctional net. The chelating thioether groups also promote Hg(II) removal from water, while the trapped Hg(II) can be easily extricated by 2-mercaptoethanol to reactivate the MOF sorbent."
Programmed manipulation of the subtle interplay of nonbonded steric interactions within a supporting ligand environment has been used for the conversion of a photochemically driven chemical cycle for group 6 metal-mediated nitrogen fixation into a thermally promoted process with increased energy efficiency and atom economy for key transformations involving N\xe2\x89\xa1N bond cleavage and N-atom functionalization of coordinated N2.
"We report the stepwise, quantitative transformation of CeIV6(\xce\xbc3-O)4(\xce\xbc3-OH)4(OH)6(OH2)6 nodes in a new Ce-BTC (BTC = trimesic acid) metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework (MOF) into the first CeIII6(\xce\xbc3-O)4(\xce\xbc3-OLi)4(H)6(THF)6Li6 metal-hydride nodes that effectively catalyze hydroboration and hydrophosphination reactions. CeH-BTC displays low steric hindrance and electron density compared to homogeneous organolanthanide catalysts, which likely accounts for the unique 1,4-regioselectivity for the hydroboration of pyridine derivatives. MOF nodes can thus be directly transformed into novel single-site solid catalysts without homogeneous counterparts for sustainable chemical synthesis."
"An effective palladium-catalyzed regioselective hydroformylation of olefins with formic acid is described. The ligand plays a crucial role in directing the reaction pathway. Linear aldehydes can be obtained in up to 93% yield with >20:1 regioselectivity using 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp) as the ligand. The reaction process is operationally simple and requires no syngas."
"Synthetic pathways to complex meroterpenes derived from 3,5-dimethylorsellinic acid (DMOA) and farnesyl pyrophosphate have not been reported despite heavy biosynthetic and medicinal interest. Herein we report the first total synthesis of berkeleyone A, a potential gateway compound to a plethora of fungal-derived meroterpenes, in 13 steps. In addition, we have further developed a novel annulation reaction for the synthesis of hydroxylated 1,3-cyclohexadiones in a single step."
"An iridium-catalyzed enantioselective hydroalkynylation of \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated amides was described. The selectivity of this reaction is distinct from that observed in many catalytic hydroalkynylations of \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. It occurs selectively at the \xce\xb3 instead of the \xce\xb2 position. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through alkene isomerization followed by hydroalkynylation. This method provides a straightforward route for the synthesis of amides with a remote stereocenter at the \xce\xb3 position."
"Pd-catalyzed meta-C\xe2\x80\x93H chlorination of anilines and phenols is developed using norbornene as the mediator. Heterocycles, including indole, thiophene, and indazole, are tolerated. The identification of a new pyridone-based ligand is crucial for the success of this meta-C\xe2\x80\x93H chlorination reaction. Subsequent diverse transformations of the chlorinated products demonstrate the versatility of meta-C\xe2\x80\x93H chlorination."
"Chromophoric biomolecules are exploited as reporters of a diverse set of phenomena, acting as internal distance monitors, environment and redox sensors, and endogenous imaging probes. The extent to which they can be exploited is dependent on an accurate knowledge of their fundamental electronic properties. Arguably of greatest importance is a precise knowledge of the direction(s) of the absorption transition dipole moment(s) (TDMs) in the molecular frame of reference. Such is the case for flavins, fluorescent redox cofactors utilized for ground- and excited-state redox and photochemical processes. The directions of the TDMs in oxidized and semiquinone flavins were characterized decades ago, and the details of charge redistribution in these forms have also been studied by Stark spectroscopy. The electronic structure of the fully reduced hydroquinone anionic state, FlH\xe2\x80\x93, however, has been the subject of unfounded assumptions and estimates about the number and direction of TDMs in FlH\xe2\x80\x93, as well the electronic structure changes that occur upon light absorption. Here we have used Stark spectroscopy to measure the magnitude and direction of charge redistribution in FlH\xe2\x80\x93 upon optical excitation. These data were analyzed using TD-DFT calculations. The results show unequivocally that not one but two nearly orientation-degenerate electronic transitions are required to explain the 340\xe2\x80\x93500 nm absorption spectral range, demolishing the commonly held assumption of a single transition. The difference dipole moments for these states show that electron density shifts toward the xylene ring for both transitions. These measurements force a reappraisal of previous studies that have used erroneous assumptions and unsubstantiated estimates of these quantities. The results put future optical studies of reduced flavins/flavoproteins on a firm photophysical footing."
"Ruthenium PNP complex 1a (RuH(CO)Cl(HN(C2H4Pi-Pr2)2)) represents a state-of-the-art catalyst for low-temperature (<100 \xc2\xb0C) aqueous methanol dehydrogenation to H2 and CO2. Herein, we describe an investigation that combines experiment, spectroscopy, and theory to provide a mechanistic rationale for this process. During catalysis, the presence of two anionic resting states was revealed, Ru\xe2\x80\x93dihydride (3\xe2\x80\x93) and Ru\xe2\x80\x93monohydride (4\xe2\x80\x93) that are deprotonated at nitrogen in the pincer ligand backbone. DFT calculations showed that O- and CH- coordination modes of methoxide to ruthenium compete, and form complexes 4\xe2\x80\x93 and 3\xe2\x80\x93, respectively. Not only does the reaction rate increase with increasing KOH, but the ratio of 3\xe2\x80\x93/4\xe2\x80\x93 increases, demonstrating that the \xe2\x80\x9cinner-sphere\xe2\x80\x9d C\xe2\x80\x94H cleavage, via C\xe2\x80\x94H coordination of methoxide to Ru, is promoted by base. Protonation of 3\xe2\x80\x93 liberates H2 gas and formaldehyde, the latter of which is rapidly consumed by KOH to give the corresponding gem-diolate and provides the overall driving force for the reaction. Full MeOH reforming is achieved through the corresponding steps that start from the gem-diolate and formate. Theoretical studies into the mechanism of the catalyst Me-1a (N-methylated 1a) revealed that C\xe2\x80\x94H coordination to Ru sets-up C\xe2\x80\x94H cleavage and hydride delivery; a process that is also promoted by base, as observed experimentally. However, in this case, Ru\xe2\x80\x93dihydride Me-3 is much more stable to protonation and can even be observed under neutral conditions. The greater stability of Me-3 rationalizes the lower rates of Me-1a compared to 1a, and also explains why the reaction rate then drops with increasing KOH concentration."
"Photolysis of 3-azido-1-indenone (1) with a light-emitting diode (LED, \xce\xbb = 405 nm) or mercury arc lamp (Pyrex) resulted in the formation of heterodimer 3 in excellent yield, through dimerization of triplet vinylnitrene 32. At ambient temperature, vinylnitrene 32 (\xce\xbbmax at 340 and 480 nm) was detected directly with laser flash photolysis of vinyl azide 1. The vinylnitrene intermediate was also characterized directly with IR and ESR spectroscopy in cryogenic matrices. The ESR spectrum of vinylnitrene 32 yielded a zero-field splitting parameter |D/hc| of 0.460 cm\xe2\x80\x931 and |E/hc| of 0.015 cm\xe2\x80\x931, which reveals that vinylnitrene 32 has significant 1,3-biradical character. The proposed mechanism for the formation and reactivity of triplet vinylnitrene 32 was supported with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which highlight that the steric demand of the five-membered ring in vinylnitrene 32 prevents intersystem crossing to the corresponding azirine (10). CASSCF and CASPT2 calculations showed that the energy gap between the singlet and triplet configurations of vinylnitrene 2 is only 10 kcal/mol. In spite of this small energy gap, vinylnitrene 32 does not decay by intersystem crossing, but rather by dimerization. Thus, triplet vinylnitrenes can be selectively formed with visible light and used to form new C\xe2\x80\x93N bonds in synthetic applications."
"Hard carbons attract myriad interest as anode materials for high-energy rechargeable batteries due to their low costs and high theoretical capacities; practically, they deliver unsatisfactory performance due to their intrinsically disordered microarchitecture. Here we report a facile ion-catalyzed synthesis of a phenol\xe2\x80\x93formaldehyde resin-based hard-carbon aerogel that takes advantage of the chelation effect of phenol and Fe3+, which consists of a three-dimensionally interconnected carbon network embedded with hydrogen-rich, ordered microstructures of expanded nanographites and carbon micropores. The chelation effect ensures the homodispersion of Fe in the polymer segments of the precursor, so that an effective catalytic conversion from sp3 to sp2 carbon occurs, enabling free rearrangement of graphene sheets into expanded nanographite and carbon micropores. The structural merits of the carbon offer chances to achieve lithium/sodium storage performance far beyond that possible with the conventional carbon anode materials, including graphite and mesocarbon microbeads, along with fast kinetics and long cycle life. In this way, our hard carbon proves its feasibility to serve as an advanced anode material for high-energy rechargeable Li/Na batteries."
"The ClC family of transmembrane proteins functions throughout nature to control the transport of Cl\xe2\x80\x93 ions across biological membranes. ClC-ec1 from Escherichia coli is an antiporter, coupling the transport of Cl\xe2\x80\x93 and H+ ions in opposite directions and driven by the concentration gradients of the ions. Despite keen interest in this protein, the molecular mechanism of the Cl\xe2\x80\x93/H+ coupling has not been fully elucidated. Here, we have used multiscale simulation to help identify the essential mechanism of the Cl\xe2\x80\x93/H+ coupling. We find that the highest barrier for proton transport (PT) from the intra- to extracellular solution is attributable to a chemical reaction, the deprotonation of glutamic acid 148 (E148). This barrier is significantly reduced by the binding of Cl\xe2\x80\x93 in the \xe2\x80\x9ccentral\xe2\x80\x9d site (Cl\xe2\x80\x93cen), which displaces E148 and thereby facilitates its deprotonation. Conversely, in the absence of Cl\xe2\x80\x93cen E148 favors the \xe2\x80\x9cdown\xe2\x80\x9d conformation, which results in a much higher cumulative rotation and deprotonation barrier that effectively blocks PT to the extracellular solution. Thus, the rotation of E148 plays a critical role in defining the Cl\xe2\x80\x93/H+ coupling. As a control, we have also simulated PT in the ClC-ec1 E148A mutant to further understand the role of this residue. Replacement with a non-protonatable residue greatly increases the free energy barrier for PT from E203 to the extracellular solution, explaining the experimental result that PT in E148A is blocked whether or not Cl\xe2\x80\x93cen is present. The results presented here suggest both how a chemical reaction can control the rate of PT and also how it can provide a mechanism for a coupling of the two ion transport processes."
"We have developed a high resolution correlative method involving cryo-soft X-ray tomography (cryo-SXT) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), which provides information in three dimensions on large cellular volumes at 70 nm resolution. Cryo-SXT morphologically identified and localized aggregations of carbon-rich materials. STORM identified specific markers on the desired epitopes, enabling colocalization between the identified objects, in this case cholesterol crystals, and the cellular environment. The samples were studied under ambient and cryogenic conditions without dehydration or heavy metal staining. The early events of cholesterol crystal development were investigated in relation to atherosclerosis, using as model macrophage cell cultures enriched with LDL particles. Atherosclerotic plaques build up in arteries in a slow process involving cholesterol crystal accumulation. Cholesterol crystal deposition is a crucial stage in the pathological cascade. Our results show that cholesterol crystals can be identified and imaged at a very early stage on the cell plasma membrane and in intracellular locations. This technique can in principle be applied to other biological samples where specific molecular identification is required in conjunction with high resolution 3D-imaging."
"Herein, we report the self-assembly and multimodal shape transformation of dual-responsive DNA di- and triblock copolymers. Dual-responsive DNA diblock copolymer was synthesized by coupling a thermoresponsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAM), and an oligonucleotide. DNA-b-PNIPAM possesses thermoresponsive properties of PNIPAM as well as molecular recognition properties of DNA. Thus, they undergo reversible temperature-triggered transition at lower critical solution temperature (LCST) between molecular DNA and polymer micelles with high density DNA corona. The hybridization of DNA-b-PNIPAM and DNA-modified nanoparticles generates functional nanoparticles showing unique temperature-dependent aggregation and disaggregation behaviors due to the dual-responsive nature of DNA-b-PNIPAM. DNA triblock copolymers of DNA-b-PNIPAM-b-PMA were synthesized by introducing a hydrophobic block, poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA), to DNA/PNIPAM block copolymers, which form spherical micelles at room temperature. They are capable of nanoscale shape transformation through the combination of thermal trigger and DNA binding. DNA-b-PNIPAM-b-PMA micelles undergo sphere-to-cylinder shape changes above LCST due to the conformational change of PNIPAM. The shape change is reversible, and fast cylinder-to-sphere transition occurs when the temperature is lowered below LCST. The low temperature spherical morphology can also be accessed while keeping the temperature above LCST by introducing complementary DNA strands with single stranded overhang regions. These results demonstrate the multidimensional shape changing capability of DNA-b-PNIPAM-b-PMA enabled by the dual-responsive property."
"Janus and patchy particles are emerging as models for studying complex directed assembly patterns and as precursors of new structured materials and composites. Here we show how lipid-induced capillary bridging could serve as a new and nonconventional method of assembling patchy particles into ordered structures. Iron oxide surface patches on latex microspheres were selectively wetted with liquid lipid, driving the particle assembly into two- and three-dimensional clusters via interparticle capillary bridge formation. The liquid phase of the bridges allows local reorganization of the particles within the clusters and assists in forming true equilibrium configurations. The temperature-driven fluid-to-gel and gel-to-fluid phase transitions of the fatty acids within the bridge act as a thermal switch for cluster assembly and disassembly. By complementing the experiments with Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the equilibrium cluster morphology is determined by the patch characteristics, namely, their size, number, and shape. This study demonstrates the ability of capillary bridging as a versatile tool to assemble thermoresponsive clusters and aggregates. This method of binding particles is simple, robust, and generic and can be extended further to assemble particles with nonspherical shapes and complex surface chemistries enabling the formation of sophisticated colloidal molecules."
"Impurity doping has been widely used to endow semiconductor nanocrystals with novel optical, electronic, and magnetic functionalities. Here, we introduce a new family of doped NCs offering unique insights into the chemical mechanism of doping, as well as into the fundamental interactions between the dopant and the semiconductor host. Specifically, by elucidating the role of relative bond strengths within the precursor and the host lattice, we develop an effective approach for incorporating manganese (Mn) ions into nanocrystals of lead-halide perovskites (CsPbX3, where X = Cl, Br, or I). In a key enabling step not possible in, for example, II\xe2\x80\x93VI nanocrystals, we use gentle chemical means to finely and reversibly tune the nanocrystal band gap over a wide range of energies (1.8\xe2\x80\x933.1 eV) via postsynthetic anion exchange. We observe a dramatic effect of halide identity on relative intensities of intrinsic band-edge and Mn emission bands, which we ascribe to the influence of the energy difference between the corresponding transitions on the characteristics of energy transfer between the Mn ion and the semiconductor host."
"Synthesizing transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers through the liquid exfoliation of bulk crystals in low boiling point polar micromolecular solvents, such as water, is paramount for their practical application. However, the resulting hydrodynamic forces only appear on the crystal edges due to the mismatch in surface tension between the polar micromolecular solvents and the bulk crystals and are insufficient to overcome the strong van der Waals attraction between adjacent microscale layers. Herein, we present the novel strategy of engineering the lateral size of TMDC (MoS2 and WS2) crystals in the nanoscale to increase the fraction of edges, leading to their direct and ready exfoliation in polar micromolecular solvents, even in pure water, to produce monolayer MoS2 and WS2 nanosheets in high yield. To examine one of their important applications, their catalytic hydrogen evolution activities were evaluated when used as cocatalysts with a photoharvester semiconductor (cadmium sulfide, CdS) in a reaction driven by solar energy. These exfoliated MoS2 (WS2) monolayers exhibited superior cocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, the cocatalytic performance of monolayer WS2 nanosheets is even higher than that of platinum (Pt), which is a state-of-the-art catalyst for catalytic hydrogen evolution. This work elucidates the importance of decreasing the lateral size of layered crystals to significantly enhance their exfoliability, providing a new strategy for the large-scale preparation of nanoscale TMDC monolayers by liquid exfoliation."
"Activation of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) causes recruitment of multiple intracellular proteins, each of which can activate distinct signaling pathways. This complexity has engendered interest in agonists that preferentially stimulate subsets among the natural signaling pathways (\xe2\x80\x9cbiased agonists\xe2\x80\x9d). We have examined analogues of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) containing \xce\xb2-amino acid residues in place of native \xce\xb1 residues at selected sites and found that some analogues differ from GLP-1 in terms of their relative abilities to promote G protein activation (as monitored via cAMP production) versus \xce\xb2-arrestin recruitment (as monitored via BRET assays). The \xce\xb1 \xe2\x86\x92 \xce\xb2 replacements generally cause modest declines in stimulation of cAMP production and \xce\xb2-arrestin recruitment, but for some replacement sets cAMP production is more strongly affected than is \xce\xb2-arrestin recruitment. The central portion of GLP-1 appears to be critical for achieving bias toward \xce\xb2-arrestin recruitment. These results suggest that backbone modification via \xce\xb1 \xe2\x86\x92 \xce\xb2 residue replacement may be a versatile source of agonists with biased GLP-1R activation profiles."
"Few-layer graphenes, supported on Si with a superficial oxide layer, were subjected to a Birch-type reduction using Li and H2O as the electron and proton donors, respectively. The extent of hydrogenation for bilayer graphene was estimated at 1.6\xe2\x80\x9324.1% according to Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic data. While single-layer graphene reacts uniformly, few-layer graphenes were hydrogenated inward from the edges and/or defects. The role of these reactive sites was reflected in the inertness of pristine few-layer graphenes whose edges were sealed. Hydrogenation of labeled bilayer (12C/13C) and trilayer (12C/13C/12C) graphenes afforded products whose sheets were hydrogenated to the same extent, implicating passage of reagents between the graphene layers and equal decoration of each graphene face. The reduction of few-layer graphenes introduces strain, allows tuning of optical transmission and fluorescence, and opens synthetic routes to long sought-after films containing sp3-hybridized carbon."
"The activation and conversion of hydrocarbons is one of the most important challenges in chemistry. Transition-metal ions (V, Cr, Fe, Co, etc.) isolated on silica surfaces are known to catalyze such processes. The mechanisms of these processes are currently unknown but are thought to involve C\xe2\x80\x93H activation as the rate-determining step. Here, we synthesize well-defined Co(II) ions on a silica surface using a metal siloxide precursor followed by thermal treatment under vacuum at 500 \xc2\xb0C. We show that these isolated Co(II) sites are catalysts for a number of hydrocarbon conversion reactions, such as the dehydrogenation of propane, the hydrogenation of propene, and the trimerization of terminal alkynes. We then investigate the mechanisms of these processes using kinetics, kinetic isotope effects, isotopic labeling experiments, parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) NMR, and comparison with a molecular analog. The data are consistent with all of these reactions occurring by a common mechanism, involving heterolytic C\xe2\x80\x93H or H\xe2\x80\x93H activation via a 1,2 addition across a Co\xe2\x80\x93O bond."
"Achieving high open-circuit voltage (Voc) for tin-based perovskite solar cells is challenging. Here, we demonstrate that a ZnS interfacial layer can improve the Voc and photovoltaic performance of formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3) perovskite solar cells. The TiO2\xe2\x80\x93ZnS electron transporting layer (ETL) with cascade conduction band structure can effectively reduce the interfacial charge recombination and facilitate electron transfer. Our best-performing FASnI3 perovskite solar cell using the cascaded TiO2\xe2\x80\x93ZnS ETL has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 5.27%, with a higher Voc of 0.380 V, a short-circuit current density of 23.09 mA cm\xe2\x80\x932, and a fill factor of 60.01%. The cascade structure is further validated with a TiO2\xe2\x80\x93CdS ETL. Our results suggest a new approach for further improving the performance of tin-based perovskite solar cells with a higher Voc."
"Transition path sampling simulations have proposed that human heart lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) employs protein promoting vibrations (PPVs) on the femtosecond (fs) to picosecond (ps) time scale to promote crossing of the chemical barrier. This chemical barrier involves both hydride and proton transfers to pyruvate to form l-lactate, using reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) as the cofactor. Here we report experimental evidence from three types of isotope effect experiments that support coupling of the promoting vibrations to barrier crossing and the coincidence of hydride and proton transfer. We prepared the native (light) LDH and a heavy LDH labeled with 13C, 15N, and nonexchangeable 2H (D) to perturb the predicted PPVs. Heavy LDH has slowed chemistry in single turnover experiments, supporting a contribution of PPVs to transition state formation. Both the [4-2H]NADH (NADD) kinetic isotope effect and the D2O solvent isotope effect were increased in dual-label experiments combining both NADD and D2O, a pattern maintained with both light and heavy LDHs. These isotope effects support concerted hydride and proton transfer for both light and heavy LDHs. Although the transition state barrier-crossing probability is reduced in heavy LDH, the concerted mechanism of the hydride\xe2\x80\x93proton transfer reaction is not altered. This study takes advantage of triple isotope effects to resolve the chemical mechanism of LDH and establish the coupling of fs-ps protein dynamics to barrier crossing."
"Low bandgap n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) ITIC has attracted great attention for the application as an acceptor with medium bandgap p-type conjugated polymer as donor in nonfullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) because of its attractive photovoltaic performance. Here we report a modification on the molecular structure of ITIC by side-chain isomerization with meta-alkyl-phenyl substitution, m-ITIC, to further improve its photovoltaic performance. In a comparison with its isomeric counterpart ITIC with para-alkyl-phenyl substitution, m-ITIC shows a higher film absorption coefficient, a larger crystalline coherence, and higher electron mobility. These inherent advantages of m-ITIC resulted in a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.77% for the nonfullerene PSCs with m-ITIC as acceptor and a medium bandgap polymer J61 as donor, which is significantly improved over that (10.57%) of the corresponding devices with ITIC as acceptor. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 11.77% is one of the highest values reported in the literature to date for nonfullerene PSCs. More importantly, the m-ITIC-based device shows less thickness-dependent photovoltaic behavior than ITIC-based devices in the active-layer thickness range of 80\xe2\x80\x93360 nm, which is beneficial for large area device fabrication. These results indicate that m-ITIC is a promising low bandgap n-OS for the application as an acceptor in PSCs, and the side-chain isomerization could be an easy and convenient way to further improve the photovoltaic performance of the donor and acceptor materials for high efficiency PSCs."
"Metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks that flex to undergo structural phase changes upon gas adsorption are promising materials for gas storage and separations, and achieving synthetic control over the pressure at which these changes occur is crucial to the design of such materials for specific applications. To this end, a new family of materials based on the flexible metal\xe2\x80\x93organic framework Co(bdp) (bdp2\xe2\x80\x93 = 1,4-benzenedipyrazolate) has been prepared via the introduction of fluorine, deuterium, and methyl functional groups on the bdp2\xe2\x80\x93 ligand, namely, Co(F-bdp), Co(p-F2-bdp), Co(o-F2-bdp), Co(D4-bdp), and Co(p-Me2-bdp). These frameworks are isoreticular to the parent framework and exhibit similar structural flexibility, transitioning from a low-porosity, collapsed phase to high-porosity, expanded phases with increasing gas pressure. Powder X-ray diffraction studies reveal that fluorination of the aryl ring disrupts edge-to-face \xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93\xcf\x80 interactions, which work to stabilize the collapsed phase at low gas pressures, while deuteration preserves these interactions and methylation strengthens them. In agreement with these observations, high-pressure CH4 adsorption isotherms show that the pressure of the CH4-induced framework expansion can be systematically controlled by ligand functionalization, as materials without edge-to-face interactions in the collapsed phase expand at lower CH4 pressures, while frameworks with strengthened edge-to-face interactions expand at higher pressures. Importantly, this work puts forth a general design strategy relevant to many other families of flexible metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks, which will be a powerful tool in optimizing these phase-change materials for industrial applications."
"Molecular design of biomaterials with unique features recapitulating nature\xe2\x80\x99s niche to influence biological activities has been a prolific area of investigation in chemistry and material science. The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides a wealth of bioactive molecules in supporting cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The well-patterned fibril and intertwining architecture of the ECM profoundly influences cell behavior and development. Inspired by those features from the ECM, we attempted to integrate essential biological factors from the ECM to design bioactive molecules to construct artificial self-supportive ECM mimics to advance stem cell culture. The synthesized biomimic molecules are able to hierarchically self-assemble into nanofibril hydrogels in physiological buffer driven by cooperative effects of electrostatic interaction, van der Waals forces, and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In addition, the hydrogel is designed to be degradable during cell culture, generating extra space to facilitate cell migration, expansion, and differentiation. We exploited the bioactive hydrogel as a growth-factor-free scaffold to support and accelerate neural stem cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation into functional neurons. Our study is a successful attempt to entirely use bioactive molecules for bottom-up self-assembly of new biomaterials mimicking the ECM to directly impact cell behaviors. Our strategy provides a new avenue in biomaterial design to advance tissue engineering and cell delivery."
"Arginine finger is a highly conserved and essential residue in many GTPase and AAA+ ATPase enzymes that completes the active site from a distinct protomer, forming contacts with the \xce\xb3-phosphate of the nucleotide. To date, no pyrophosphatase has been identified that employs an arginine finger fulfilling all of the above properties; all essential arginine fingers are used to catalyze the cleavage of the \xce\xb3-phosphate. Here, we identify and unveil the role of a conserved arginine residue in trimeric dUTPases that meets all the criteria established for arginine fingers. We found that the conserved arginine adjacent to the P-loop-like motif enables structural organization of the active site for efficient catalysis via its nucleotide coordination, while its direct electrostatic role in transition state stabilization is secondary. An exhaustive structure-based comparison of analogous, conserved arginines from nucleotide hydrolases and transferases revealed a consensus amino acid location and orientation for contacting the \xce\xb3-phosphate of the substrate nucleotide. Despite the structurally equivalent position, functional differences between arginine fingers of dUTPases and NTPases are explained on the basis of the unique chemistry performed by the pyrophosphatase dUTPases."
"Iron\xe2\x80\x93nitrogen on carbon (Fe\xe2\x80\x93N/C) catalysts have emerged as promising nonprecious metal catalysts (NPMCs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in energy conversion and storage devices. It has been widely suggested that an active site structure for Fe\xe2\x80\x93N/C catalysts contains Fe\xe2\x80\x93Nx coordination. However, the preparation of high-performance Fe\xe2\x80\x93N/C catalysts mostly involves a high-temperature pyrolysis step, which generates not only catalytically active Fe\xe2\x80\x93Nx sites, but also less active large iron-based particles. Herein, we report a general \xe2\x80\x9csilica-protective-layer-assisted\xe2\x80\x9d approach that can preferentially generate the catalytically active Fe\xe2\x80\x93Nx sites in Fe\xe2\x80\x93N/C catalysts while suppressing the formation of large Fe-based particles. The catalyst preparation consisted of an adsorption of iron porphyrin precursor on carbon nanotube (CNT), silica layer overcoating, high-temperature pyrolysis, and silica layer etching, which yielded CNTs coated with thin layer of porphyrinic carbon (CNT/PC) catalysts. Temperature-controlled in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy during the preparation of CNT/PC catalyst revealed the coordination of silica layer to stabilize the Fe\xe2\x80\x93N4 sites. The CNT/PC catalyst contained higher density of active Fe\xe2\x80\x93Nx sites compared to the CNT/PC prepared without silica coating. The CNT/PC showed very high ORR activity and excellent stability in alkaline media. Importantly, an alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) with a CNT/PC-based cathode exhibited record high current and power densities among NPMC-based AEMFCs. In addition, a CNT/PC-based cathode exhibited a high volumetric current density of 320 A cm\xe2\x80\x933 in acidic proton exchange membrane fuel cell. We further demonstrated the generality of this synthetic strategy to other carbon supports."
"Encapsulation of unstable guests is a powerful way to enhance their stability. The lifetimes of organic anions and their radicals produced by reduction are typically short on account of reactivity with oxygen while their larger sizes preclude use of traditional anion receptors. Here we demonstrate the encapsulation and noncovalent stabilization of organic radical anions by C\xe2\x80\x93H hydrogen bonding in \xcf\x80-stacked pairs of cyanostar macrocycles having large cavities. Using electrogenerated tetrazine radical anions, we observe significant extension of their lifetimes, facile molecular switching, and extremely large stabilization energies. The guests form threaded pseudorotaxanes. Complexation extends the radical lifetimes from 2 h to over 20 days without altering its electronic structure. Electrochemical studies show tetrazines thread inside a pair of cyanostar macrocycles following voltage-driven reduction (+e\xe2\x80\x93) of the tetrazine at \xe2\x88\x921.00 V and that the complex disassembles after reoxidation (\xe2\x88\x92e\xe2\x80\x93) at \xe2\x88\x920.05 V. This reoxidation is shifted 830 mV relative to the free tetrazine radical indicating it is stabilized by an unexpectedly large \xe2\x88\x9280 kJ mol\xe2\x80\x931. The stabilization is general as shown using a dithiadiazolyl anion. This finding opens up a new approach to capturing and studying unstable anions and a radical anions when encapsulated by size-complementary anion receptors."
"Introducing chirality into photomechanical crystals is beneficial for the diversification of mechanical motion. Measurement of the chiroptical and optical anisotropic properties of chiral crystals is indispensable for evaluating photomechanical crystals. The platelike crystals of S- and R-enantiomers of photochromic N-3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylidene-1-phenylethylamine in enol form (enol-(S)-1 and enol-(R)-1) caused bending motion with twisting upon ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation, due to shrinkage along the length and width directions of the irradiated surface, based on the optimized crystal structure of the photoisomerized trans-keto-(S)-1. By employing the generalized high-accuracy universal polarimeter (G-HAUP), optical anisotropic (linear birefringence, LB; linear dichroism, LD) as well as chiroptical (circular birefringence, CB; circular dichroism, CD) spectra of both the enantiomeric crystals on the (001) face were simultaneously measured before and under continuous UV irradiation. The LD peak was observed at 330 nm in the negative sign, derived from the \xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93\xcf\x80* transition of the intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded salicylidenimino moiety. The CD spectra of the S and R crystals revealed the negative and positive Cotton effect at 330 nm, respectively, and new peaks appeared at 460 nm under UV light irradiation due to photoisomerization to the S and R trans-keto isomers at around 10% conversion. The CB and CD spectra evaluated by the HAUP measurement were opposite to those measured in the hexane solution, as well as those simulated by quantum chemical calculation. The dissymmetry parameter, g, of the enol-(S)-1 crystal along the c axis (0.013) was approximately 10 times larger than the g values in the solution (0.0010) and by calculation (0.0016)."
"Specific cell adhesion and osteogenicity are both crucial factors for the long-term success of titanium implants. In this work, two mussel-derived bioactive peptides were designed to one-step dual-biofunctionalization of titanium implants via robust catechol/TiO2 coordinative interactions. The highly biomimetic peptides capped with integrin-targeted sequence or osteogenic growth sequence could efficiently improve the biocompatibilities of titanium implants and endow the implants with abilities to induce specific cell adhesion and enhanced osteogenicity. More importantly, rationally combined use of the two biomimetic peptides indicated an enhanced synergism on osteogenicity, osseointegration and finally the mechanical stability of Ti implants in vivo. Therefore, the highly biomimetic mussel-derived peptides and the dual-functional strategy in this study would provide a facile, safe, and effective means for improving clinical outcome of titanium-based medical implants."
"Redox mediators play a major role determining the photocurrent and the photovoltage in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). To maintain the photocurrent, the reduction of oxidized dye by the redox mediator should be significantly faster than the electron back transfer between TiO2 and the oxidized dye. The driving force for dye regeneration with the redox mediator should be sufficiently low to provide high photovoltages. With the introduction of our new copper complexes as promising redox mediators in DSCs both criteria are satisfied to enhance power conversion efficiencies. In this study, two copper bipyridyl complexes, Cu(II/I)(dmby)2TFSI2/1 (0.97 V vs SHE, dmby = 6,6\xe2\x80\xb2-dimethyl-2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-bipyridine) and Cu(II/I)(tmby)2TFSI2/1 (0.87 V vs SHE, tmby = 4,4\xe2\x80\xb2,6,6\xe2\x80\xb2-tetramethyl-2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-bipyridine), are presented as new redox couples for DSCs. They are compared to previously reported Cu(II/I)(dmp)2TFSI2/1 (0.93 V vs SHE, dmp = bis(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline). Due to the small reorganization energy between Cu(I) and Cu(II) species, these copper complexes can sufficiently regenerate the oxidized dye molecules with close to unity yield at driving force potentials as low as 0.1 V. The high photovoltages of over 1.0 V were achieved by the series of copper complex based redox mediators without compromising photocurrent densities. Despite the small driving forces for dye regeneration, fast and efficient dye regeneration (2\xe2\x80\x933 \xce\xbcs) was observed for both complexes. As another advantage, the electron back transfer (recombination) rates were slower with Cu(II/I)(tmby)2TFSI2/1 as evidenced by longer lifetimes. The solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies for [Cu(tmby)2]2+/1+, [Cu(dmby)2]2+/1+, and [Cu(dmp)2]2+/1+ based electrolytes were 10.3%, 10.0%, and 10.3%, respectively, using the organic Y123 dye under 1000 W m\xe2\x80\x932 AM1.5G illumination. The high photovoltaic performance of Cu-based redox mediators underlines the significant potential of the new redox mediators and points to a new research and development direction for DSCs."
Mutation of a protein with one function until it adopts a new function involves an interplay between protein flexibility and rigidity.
Reliable methods to determine the subcellular localization of bacterial proteins are needed for the study of prokaryotic cell biology. We describe here a simple and general technique for imaging of bacterial proteins in situ by fluorescence microscopy. The method uses the eukaryotic enzyme N-myristoyltransferase to modify the N-terminus of the protein of interest with an azido fatty acid. Subsequent strain-promoted azide\xe2\x80\x93alkyne cycloaddition allows conjugation of dyes and imaging of tagged proteins by confocal fluorescence microscopy. We demonstrate the method by labeling the chemotaxis proteins Tar and CheA and the cell division proteins FtsZ and FtsA in Escherichia coli. We observe distinct spatial patterns for each of these proteins in both fixed and live cells. The method should prove broadly useful for protein imaging in bacteria.
"Pore space partition, especially the one using C3-symmetric 2,4,6-tri(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine as pore-partition agent in MIL-88 type (the acs net), has been shown to dramatically enhance CO2 uptake to near-record values. The continued advance in property engineering via pore space partition would depend on intelligent design of both framework components and pore-partition agent. Here, we report a new advance in the design of pore-partition agent by demonstrating a symmetry-guided pathway to develop a large variety of di- and trinuclear 1,2,4-triazolate-based clusters for use as pore-partition agent. The use of metal\xe2\x80\x93organic clusters (instead of organic ligands) as pore-partition agent gives rise to many new pore-partitioned materials with huge compositional variety. The full assembly involves the simultaneous formation of two separate coordination architectures (i.e., the 3-D acs framework and 0-D triazolate clusters) and the eventual welding between the acs framework and triazolate clusters. The wide range of new compositions and structures provides a high degree of tunability in gas sorption properties."
"Heterocyclic silanes containing Si\xe2\x80\x93N or Si\xe2\x80\x93S bonds in the ring undergo a ring opening reaction with \xe2\x88\x92OH groups at the surface of porous Si nanostructures to generate \xe2\x88\x92SH or \xe2\x88\x92NH functional surfaces, grafted via O\xe2\x80\x93Si bonds. The reaction is substantially faster (0.5\xe2\x80\x932 h at 25 \xc2\xb0C) and more efficient than hydrolytic condensation of trialkoxysilanes on similar hydroxy-terminated surfaces, and the reaction retains the open pore structure and photoluminescence of the quantum-confined silicon nanostructures. The chemistry is sufficiently mild to allow trapping of the test protein lysozyme, which retains its enzymatic activity upon release from the modified porous nanostructure."
"In electrochemical processes, an oxidation half-reaction is always paired with a reduction half-reaction. Although systems for reactions such as the reduction of CO2 can be coupled to water oxidation to produce O2 at the anode, large-scale O2 production is of limited value. One may replace a low-value half-reaction with a compatible half-reaction that can produce a valuable chemical compound and operate at a lower potential. In doing so, both the anodic and cathodic half-reactions yield desirable products with a decreased energy demand. Here we demonstrate a paired electrolysis in the case of the oxidative condensation of syringaldehyde and o-phenylenediamine to give 2-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole coupled with the reduction of CO2 to CO mediated by molecular electrocatalysts. We also present general principles for evaluating current\xe2\x80\x93voltage characteristics and power demands in paired electrolyzers."
"Hydrogen bonds are ubiquitous interactions in molecular recognition. The energetics of such processes are governed by the competing influences of pre-organization and flexibility that are often hard to predict. Here we have measured the strength of intramolecular interactions between H-bond donor and acceptor sites separated by a variable linker. A striking distance-dependent threshold was observed in the intramolecular interaction energies. H-bonds were worth less than \xe2\x88\x921 kJ mol\xe2\x80\x931 when the interacting groups were separated by \xe2\x89\xa56 rotating bonds, but ranged between \xe2\x88\x925 and \xe2\x88\x929 kJ mol\xe2\x80\x931 for \xe2\x89\xa45 rotors. Thus, only very strong external H-bond acceptors were able to compete with the stronger internal H-bonds. In addition, a constant energetic penalty per rotor of \xe2\x88\xbc5\xe2\x80\x936 kJ mol\xe2\x80\x931 was observed in less strained situations where the molecule contained \xe2\x89\xa54 rotatable bonds."
"Chemical de-caging has emerged as an attractive strategy for gain-of-function study of proteins via small-molecule reagents. The previously reported chemical de-caging reactions have been largely centered on liberating the side chain of lysine on a given protein. Herein, we developed an allene-based caging moiety and the corresponding palladium de-caging reagents for chemical rescue of tyrosine (Tyr) activity on intracellular proteins. This bioorthogonal de-caging pair has been successfully applied to unmask enzymatic Tyr sites (e.g., Y671 on Taq polymerase and Y728 on Anthrax lethal factor) as well as the post-translational Tyr modification site (Y416 on Src kinase) in vitro and in living cells. Our strategy provides a general platform for chemical rescue of Tyr-dependent protein activity inside cells."
"A palladium(II)-catalyzed 1,2-dicarbofunctionalization reaction of unactivated alkenes has been developed, wherein a cleavable bidentate directing group is used to control the regioselectivity and stabilize the putative alkylpalladium(II) intermediate. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a broad range of nucleophiles and electrophiles were found to participate in this transformation, providing moderate to high yields. 3-Butenoic acid derivatives containing internal alkenes and \xce\xb1-substituents were reactive substrates, offering a powerful platform for preparing \xce\xb2,\xce\xb3-substituted carbonyl compounds with multiple stereocenters."
"The synthesis and characterization of a new class of neutral aminyl radicals is reported. Monoradicals were obtained by reduction of azoimidazolium dyes with potassium. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational data suggest that the spin density is centered on one of the nitrogen atoms of the former azo group. The reduction of a dimeric dye with an octamethylbiphenylene bridge between the azo groups resulted in the formation of a biradical with largely independent unpaired electrons. Both the monoradicals and the biradical were found to display high stability in solution as well as in the solid state."
"The phenomenon of luminescence concentration quenching exists widely in lanthanide-based luminescent materials, setting a limit on the content of lanthanide emitter that can be used to hold the brightness. Here, we introduce a concept involving energy harvesting by a strong absorber and subsequent energy transfer to a lanthanide that largely alleviates concentration quenching. We apply this concept to Nd3+ emitters, and we show both experimentally and theoretically that the optimal doping concentration of Nd3+ in colloidal NaYF4:Nd upconverting nanoparticles is increased from 2 to 20 mol% when an energy harvestor organic dye (indocyanine green, ICG) is anchored onto the nanoparticle surface, resulting in \xe2\x88\xbc10 times upconversion brightness. Theoretical analysis indicated that a combination of efficient photon harvesting due to the large absorption cross section of ICG (\xe2\x88\xbc30\xe2\x80\xaf000 times higher than that of Nd3+), non-radiative energy transfer (efficiency \xe2\x88\xbc57%) from ICG to the surface bound Nd3+ ions, and energy migration among the Nd3+ ions was able to activate Nd3+ ions inside the nanoparticle at a rate comparable with that of the pronounced short-range quenching interaction at elevated Nd3+ concentrations. This resulted in the optimal concentration increase to produce significantly enhanced brightness. Theoretical modeling shows a good agreement with the experimental observation. This strategy can be utilized for a wide range of other lanthanide-doped nanomaterials being utilized for bioimaging and solar cell applications."
"Constructing metalated three-dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks is a challenging synthetic task. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a highly porous (SABET = 5083 m2 g\xe2\x80\x931) 3D COF with a record low density (0.13 g cm\xe2\x80\x933) containing \xcf\x80-electron conjugated dehydrobenzoannulene (DBA) units. Metalation of DBA-3D-COF 1 with Ni to produce Ni-DBA-3D-COF results in a minimal reduction in the surface area (SABET = 4763 m2 g\xe2\x80\x931) of the material due to the incorporation of the metal within the cavity of the DBA units, and retention of crystallinity. Both 3D DBA-COFs also display great uptake capacities for ethane and ethylene gas."
"The preparation of 3D and 2D Cu(I) coordination networks using ditopic m-terphenyl isocyanides is described. The incorporation of sterically encumbering substituents enables the controlled, solid-state preparation of Cu(I) tris-isocyanide nodes with a labile solvent ligand in a manner mirroring solution-phase chemistry of monomeric complexes. The protection afforded by the m-terphenyl groups is also shown to engender significant stability towards heat as well as acidic or basic conditions, resulting in robust single-metal-node networks that can transition from 3D to 2D extended structures."
"A negative feedback loop that relies on the coordination-coupled deprotonation (CCD) of a hydrazone switch has been developed. Above a particular threshold of zinc(II), CCD releases enough protons to the environment to trigger a cascade of reactions that yield an imine. This imine sequesters the excess of zinc(II) from the hydrazone switch, hence lowering the effective amount of protons, and switching the cascade reactions \xe2\x80\x9cOFF\xe2\x80\x9d, thus establishing the negative feedback loop."
"An efficient synthetic method for preparing enantioenriched secondary borylalkanes has been achieved through a copper-catalyzed regio- and enantioselective hydroallylation of alkenyl boronates and boramides employing hydrosilanes and allylic phosphates. In the presence of a copper catalyst with a chiral Walphos ligand, a range of alkenylboron compounds with an aryl, heteroaryl, or alkyl substituent produced secondary homoallylic alkylboron compounds in good yields and with high enantioselectivities up to 99% ee. The utility of the resulting alkylboronates was demonstrated in an efficient synthesis of (S)-massoialactone."
"Conformational flexibility allows proteins to adopt multiple functionally important conformations but can also lead to nonfunctional structures. We analyzed the dynamic behavior of the enzyme guanylate kinase as it evolved into the GK protein interaction domain (GKPID) to investigate the role of flexibility in the evolution of new protein functions. We found that the ancestral enzyme is very flexible, allowing it to adopt open conformations that can bind nucleotide and closed ones that enable catalysis of phosphotransfer from ATP to GMP. Historical mutations that converted the GK from an enzyme to a protein interaction domain dramatically reduce flexibility, predominantly by inhibiting rotations of the protein backbone that are coupled to the global closing motion. Removing flexibility prevents adoption of conformations that cannot fit the protein partner in the binding site. Our results highlight the importance of mutations that optimize protein conformational flexibility with function during evolution."
"Natural products (NPs) serve important roles as drug candidates and as tools for chemical biology. However, traditional NP discovery, largely based on bioassay-guided approaches, is biased toward abundant compounds and rediscovery rates are high. Orthogonal methods to facilitate discovery of new NPs are thus needed, and herein we describe an isotope tag-based expansion of reactivity-based NP screening to address these shortcomings. Reactivity-based screening is a directed discovery approach in which a specific reactive handle on the NP is targeted by a chemoselective probe to enable its detection by mass spectrometry. In this study, we have developed an aminooxy-containing probe to guide the discovery of aldehyde- and ketone-containing NPs. To facilitate the detection of labeling events, the probe was dibrominated, imparting a unique isotopic signature to distinguish labeled metabolites from spectral noise. As a proof of concept, the probe was then utilized to screen a collection of bacterial extracts, leading to the identification of a new analogue of antipain, deimino-antipain. The bacterial producer of deimino-antipain was sequenced and the responsible biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by bioinformatic analysis and heterologous expression. These data reveal the previously undetermined genetic basis for a well-known family of aldehyde-containing, peptidic protease inhibitors, including antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, elastatinal, and microbial alkaline protease inhibitor, which have been widely used for over 40 years."
"The regiochemistry of the nitration of toluene by NO2+BF4\xe2\x80\x93 in dichloromethane is accurately predicted from trajectories in explicit solvent. Simpler models and approaches based on transition state theory fail to account for the selectivity. Potential of mean force calculations find no free-energy barrier for reaction of the toluene/NO2+BF4\xe2\x80\x93 encounter complex, yet the trajectories require an extraordinary 3 ps to descend an exergonic slope. The selectivity is decided late in long trajectories because their completion requires solvent and counterion reorganization. The normal descriptive understanding of the regiochemistry based on transition-state energies is unsupported."
"A metastable, polymorphic hexameric crystal structure of lithium pinacolone enolate (LiOPin) is reported along with three preparation methods. NMR-based structural characterization implies that the lithium pinacolate hexamer deaggregates to a tetramer in toluene but retains mainly the hexameric structure in nonaromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as cyclohexane. Moreover, the presence of a small amount of lithium aldolate (LiOA) dramatically influences the aggregation state of LiOPin by forming a mixed aggregate with a 3:1 ratio (LiOPin3\xc2\xb7LiOA)."
"Some metal organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporate nodes that are nanoscale metal oxides, and the hydroxy-containing functional groups on them provide opportunities for introducing catalytic sites with precisely defined structures. Investigations have been done to understand the structures of these groups on nodes and node vacancies, because, in prospect, atomic-scale modulation of the composition, areal density, and/or siting of the groups would open up possibilities for exquisite tuning of the siting and performance of subsequently anchored catalytic units (e.g., single metal ions, pairs of metal ions, or well-defined metal-ion-containing clusters). We have combined infrared (IR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) to demonstrate tuning of these sites, namely, hydrogen-bonded OH/OH2 groups on the Zr6 nodes of the MOFs UiO-66 and NU-1000 via the intermediacy of node methoxy (or ethoxy) groups formed from methanol (or ethanol). Methoxy (or ethoxy) groups on node vacancy sites are converted to a structure incorporating one vacant Zr site and one terminal OH group per face by reaction with water. Our results highlight how the combination of DFT and IR spectroscopy facilitates the determination of the identity and chemistry of the functional groups on MOF node vacancies and defect sites."
"Aggregates of proteins containing polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats are strongly associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. The length of the repeats correlates with the severity of the disease. Previous studies have shown that pure polyQ peptides aggregate by nucleated growth polymerization and that the size of the critical nucleus (n*) decreases from tetrameric to dimeric and monomeric as length increases from Q18 to Q26. Why the critical nucleus size changes with repeat-length has been unclear. Using the associative memory, water-mediated, structure and energy model, we construct the aggregation free energy landscapes for polyQ peptides of different repeat-lengths. These studies show that the monomer of the shorter repeat-length (Q20) prefers an extended conformation and that its aggregation indeed has a trimeric nucleus (n* \xe2\x88\xbc 3), while a longer repeat-length monomer (Q30) prefers a \xce\xb2-hairpin conformation which then aggregates in a downhill fashion at 0.1 mM. For an intermediate length peptide (Q26), there is an equal preference for hairpin and extended forms in the monomer which leads to a mixed inhomogeneous nucleation mechanism for fibrils. The predicted changes of monomeric structure and nucleation mechanism are confirmed by studying the aggregation free energy profile for a polyglutamine repeat with site-specific PG mutations that favor the hairpin form, giving results in harmony with experiments on this system."
"Physisorption is an effective route to meet hydrogen gas (H2) storage and delivery requirements for transportation because it is fast and fully reversible under mild conditions. However, most current candidates have too small binding enthalpies to H2 which leads to volumetric capacity less than 10 g/L compared to that of the system target of 40 g/L at 298 K. Accurate quantum mechanical (QM) methods were used to determine the H2 binding enthalpy of 5 linkers which were chelated with 11 different transition metals (Tm), including abundant first-row Tm (Sc through Cu), totaling 60 molecular compounds with more than 4 configurations related to the different number of H2 that interact with the molecular compound. It was found that first-row Tm gave similar and sometimes superior van der Waals interactions with H2 than precious Tm. Based on these linkers, 30 new covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were constructed. The H2 uptakes of these new COFs were determined using quantum mechanics (QM)-based force fields and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. For the first time, the range for the adsorption pressure was explored for 0\xe2\x80\x93700 bar and 298 K. It was determined that Co-, Ni-, and Fe-based COFs can give high H2 uptake and delivery when compared to bulk H2 on this unexplored range of pressure."
"Carbanionic intermediates play a central role in the catalytic transformations of amino acids performed by pyridoxal-5\xe2\x80\xb2-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes. Here, we make use of NMR crystallography\xe2\x80\x94the synergistic combination of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography, and computational chemistry\xe2\x80\x94to interrogate a carbanionic/quinonoid intermediate analogue in the \xce\xb2-subunit active site of the PLP-requiring enzyme tryptophan synthase. The solid-state NMR chemical shifts of the PLP pyridine ring nitrogen and additional sites, coupled with first-principles computational models, allow a detailed model of protonation states for ionizable groups on the cofactor, substrates, and nearby catalytic residues to be established. Most significantly, we find that a deprotonated pyridine nitrogen on PLP precludes formation of a true quinonoid species and that there is an equilibrium between the phenolic and protonated Schiff base tautomeric forms of this intermediate. Natural bond orbital analysis indicates that the latter builds up negative charge at the substrate C\xce\xb1 and positive charge at C4\xe2\x80\xb2 of the cofactor, consistent with its role as the catalytic tautomer. These findings support the hypothesis that the specificity for \xce\xb2-elimination/replacement versus transamination is dictated in part by the protonation states of ionizable groups on PLP and the reacting substrates and underscore the essential role that NMR crystallography can play in characterizing both chemical structure and dynamics within functioning enzyme active sites."
"Protein film electrochemistry (PFE) has been used to study the assembly of the complex 6Fe active site of [FeFe]-hydrogenases (known as the H-cluster) from its precursors\xe2\x80\x94the [4Fe-4S] domain that is already coordinated within the host, and the 2Fe domain that is presented as a synthetic water-soluble complex stabilized by an additional CO. Not only does PFE allow control of redox states via the electrode potential but also the immobilized state of the enzyme facilitates control of extremely low concentrations of the 2Fe complex. Results for two enzymes, CrHydA1 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and CpI from Clostridium pasteurianum, are very similar, despite large differences in size and structure. Assembly begins with very tight binding of the 34-valence electron 2Fe complex to the apo-[4Fe-4S] enzyme, well before the rate-determining step. The precursor is trapped under highly reducing conditions (<\xe2\x88\x920.5 V vs SHE) that prevent fusion of the [4Fe-4S] and 2Fe domains (via cysteine-S) since the immediate product would be too electron-rich. Relaxing this condition allows conversion to the active H-cluster. The intramolecular steps are relevant to the final stage of biological H-cluster maturation."
"Viologen-centered electron transfer is used to trigger a complete dissociation of a porphyrin-based supramolecular architecture. In the oxidized state, self-assembly is induced by iterative association of individual porphyrin-based tectons. Dissociation of the self-assembled species is actuated upon changing the redox state of the bipyridium units involved in the tectons from their dicationic state to their radical cation state, the driving force of the disassembling process being the formation of an intramolecularly locked conformation partly stabilized by \xcf\x80-dimerization of both viologen cation radicals."
"Enhancing the selectivity of catalytic processes has potential for substantially increasing the sustainability of chemical production. Herein, we establish relationships between reaction selectivity and molecular structure for a homologous series of key intermediates for oxidative coupling of alcohols on gold using a combination of experiment and theory. We establish a scale of binding for molecules with different alkyl structures and chain lengths and thereby demonstrate the critical nature of noncovalent van der Waals interactions in determining the selectivity by modulating the stability of key reaction intermediates bound to the surface. The binding hierarchy is the same for Au(111) and Au(110), which demonstrates a relative lack of sensitivity to the surface structure. The hierarchy of binding established in this work provides guiding principles for predicting how molecular structure affects the competition for binding sites more broadly. Besides the nature of the primary surface-molecule bonding, three additional factors that affect the stabilities of the reactive intermediates are clearly established: (1) the number of C atoms in the alkyl chain, (2) the presence of C\xe2\x80\x93C bond unsaturation, and (3) the degree of branching of the alkyl group of the adsorbed molecules. We suggest that this is a fundamental principle that is generally applicable to a broad range of reactions on metal catalysts."
"The stabilization of the transition state for hlGPDH-catalyzed reduction of DHAP due to the action of the phosphodianion of DHAP and the cationic side chain of R269 is between 12.4 and 17 kcal/mol. The R269A mutation of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (hlGPDH) results in a 9.1 kcal/mol destabilization of the transition state for enzyme-catalyzed reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) by NADH, and there is a 6.7 kcal/mol stabilization of this transition state by 1.0 M guanidine cation (Gua+) [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 5312\xe2\x80\x935315]. The R269A mutant shows no detectable activity toward reduction of glycolaldehyde (GA), or activation of this reaction by 30 mM HPO32\xe2\x80\x93. We report the unprecedented self-assembly of R269A hlGPDH, dianions (X2\xe2\x80\x93 = FPO32\xe2\x80\x93, HPO32\xe2\x80\x93, or SO42\xe2\x80\x93), Gua+ and GA into a functioning catalyst of the reduction of GA, and fourth-order reaction rate constants kcat/KGAKXKGua. The linear logarithmic correlation (slope = 1.0) between values of kcat/KGAKX for dianion activation of wildtype hlGPDH-catalyzed reduction of GA and kcat/KGAKXKGua shows that the electrostatic interaction between exogenous dianions and the side chain of R269 is not significantly perturbed by cutting hlGPDH into R269A and Gua+ pieces. The advantage for connection of hlGPDH (R269A mutant + Gua+) and substrate pieces (GA + HPi) pieces, (\xce\x94GS\xe2\x80\xa1)HPi+E+Gua = 5.6 kcal/mol, is nearly equal to the sum of the advantage to connection of the substrate pieces, (\xce\x94GS\xe2\x80\xa1)GA+HPi = 3.3 kcal/mol, for wildtype hlGPDH-catalyzed reaction of GA + HPi, and for connection of the enzyme pieces, (\xce\x94GS\xe2\x80\xa1)E+Gua = 2.4 kcal/mol, for Gua+ activation of the R269A hlGPDH-catalyzed reaction of DHAP."
"Understanding protein folding mechanisms and their sequence dependence requires the determination of residue-specific apparent kinetic rate constants for the folding and unfolding reactions. Conventional two-dimensional NMR, such as HSQC experiments, can provide residue-specific information for proteins. However, folding is generally too fast for such experiments. ZZ-exchange NMR spectroscopy allows determination of folding and unfolding rates on much faster time scales, yet even this regime is not fast enough for many protein folding reactions. The application of high hydrostatic pressure slows folding by orders of magnitude due to positive activation volumes for the folding reaction. We combined high pressure perturbation with ZZ-exchange spectroscopy on two autonomously folding protein domains derived from the ribosomal protein, L9. We obtained residue-specific apparent rates at 2500 bar for the N-terminal domain of L9 (NTL9), and rates at atmospheric pressure for a mutant of the C-terminal domain (CTL9) from pressure dependent ZZ-exchange measurements. Our results revealed that NTL9 folding is almost perfectly two-state, while small deviations from two-state behavior were observed for CTL9. Both domains exhibited large positive activation volumes for folding. The volumetric properties of these domains reveal that their transition states contain most of the internal solvent excluded voids that are found in the hydrophobic cores of the respective native states. These results demonstrate that by coupling it with high pressure, ZZ-exchange can be extended to investigate a large number of protein conformational transitions."
"Dinuclear polypyridylruthenium(II) complexes bridged by a flexible methylene linker have received considerable interest as potential antibacterial agents. Their potency and uptake into bacterial cells is directly modulated by the length of the bridging linker, which has implicated membrane interactions as an essential feature of their mechanism of action. In this work, a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and solid-state NMR was used to present an atomistic model of a polypyridylruthenium(II) complex bound and incorporated into a bacterial membrane model. The results of 31P, 2H, 1H, and 13C NMR studies revealed that the antibacterial [{Ru(phen)2}2(\xce\xbc-bb12)]4+ complex (Rubb12), where phen = 1,10-phenanthroline and bb12 = bis[4(4\xe2\x80\xb2-methyl-2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-bipyridyl)]-1,12-dodecane), incorporated into a negatively charged model bacterial membrane, but only associated with the surface of a charge-neutral model of a eukaryotic membrane. Furthermore, an inactive [{Ir(phen)2}2(\xce\xbc-bb12)]6+ (Irbb12) analogue, which is not taken up by bacterial cells, maintained only a surface-bound association with both bacterial and eukaryotic model membranes according to 31P and 2H NMR. The effects of Rubb12 on 31P chemical shift anisotropy and 2H acyl chain order parameters for negatively charged membranes correlated with a membrane-spanning state of the complex according to MD simulation\xe2\x80\x93in which the metal centers embed in the lipid head group region and the central void, created by the biconic shape of the complex, resulting in increasing disorder of lipid acyl chains and membrane-thinning. A transbilayer mechanism and membrane-spanning may be essential for the cellular uptake and antibacterial activity of this class of compounds."
"We describe a method for the site-selective construction of a C(aryl)\xe2\x80\x93C(sp3) bond by the palladium-catalyzed direct allylation of arenes with allylic pivalates in the presence of AgOPiv to afford the linear (E)-allylated arene with excellent regioselectivity; this reaction occurs with arenes that have not undergone site-selective and stereoselective direct allylation previously, such as monofluorobenzenes and non-fluorinated arenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that AgOPiv ligated by a phosphine reacts with the arene to form an arylsilver(I) species, presumably through a concerted metalation\xe2\x80\x93deprotonation pathway. The activated aryl moiety is then transferred to an allylpalladium(II) intermediate formed by oxidative addition of the allylic pivalate to the Pd(0) complex. Subsequent reductive elimination furnishes the allyl\xe2\x80\x93aryl coupled product. The aforementioned proposed intermediates, including an arylsilver complex, have been isolated, structurally characterized, and determined to be chemically and kinetically competent to undergo the proposed elementary steps of the catalytic cycle."
Two new porphyrin-based supramolecular receptors for C60 offer new insights into the design of such assemblies for use in photovoltaic devices.
"Triplet 2-formyl phenylnitrene was generated by photolysis of 2-formyl phenylazide isolated in Ar, Kr, and Xe matrixes and characterized by IR, UV\xe2\x80\x93vis, and EPR spectroscopies. Upon generation at 10 K, the triplet nitrene spontaneously rearranges in the dark to singlet 6-imino-2,4-cyclohexadien-1-ketene on the time scale of several hours. The intramolecular [1,4] H atom shift from the nitrene to the imino ketene occurs by tunneling, on the triplet manifold, followed by intersystem crossing. This case constitutes the first direct evidence of a tunneling reaction involving a nitrene."
"An end-on superoxido complex with the formula {[CoIII(OH2)(trpy)][CoIII(OO\xe2\x80\xa2)(trpy)](\xce\xbc-bpp)}4+ (34+) (bpp\xe2\x80\x93 = bis(2-pyridyl)-3,5-pyrazolate; trpy = 2,2\xe2\x80\xb2;6\xe2\x80\xb2:2\xe2\x80\xb3-terpyridine) has been characterized by resonance Raman, electron paramagnetic resonance, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies. These results together with online mass spectrometry experiments using 17O and 18O isotopically labeled compounds prove that this compound is a key intermediate of the water oxidation reaction catalyzed by the peroxido-bridged complex {[CoIII(trpy)]2(\xce\xbc-bpp)(\xce\xbc-OO)}3+ (13+). DFT calculations agree with and complement the experimental data, offering a complete description of the transition states and intermediates involved in the catalytic cycle."
"Here we describe size-dependent electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of citrate-stabilized Au nanoparticles (NPs) onto indium-tin-oxide-coated glass (glass/ITO) electrodes as studied by linear sweep stripping voltammetry (LSSV) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). LSSV allows both the determination of the Au NP coverage and NP size from the peak area and the peak potential, respectively. Two-electrode EPD in aqueous solutions of Au NPs plus H2O2 reveal that a minimum potential of 1.5 V is needed for significant deposition of 4 nm diameter Au NPs as opposed to 2.0 V for 33 nm diameter Au NPs. EPD at 0.4 V in a solution of Au NPs prepared with a short 5 min reaction time led to the successful capture of 1\xe2\x80\x932 nm diameter Au NPs with appreciable coverage. In all cases, deposition did not occur in the absence of H2O2. Three-electrode experiments with a real reference electrode revealed the same size selective deposition with potential and that the amount of Au deposited depends on the deposition time and H2O2 concentration. The deposition occurs indirectly by oxidation of H2O2, which liberates protons and neutralizes the citrate stabilizer, leading to precipitation of the Au NPs onto the glass/ITO electrode. Studies on pH stability show that larger Au NPs aggregate at lower pH compared to smaller Au NPs. More importantly, though, 4 nm diameter Au NPs are much more catalytic for H2O2 oxidation, which is the main reason for the size selective deposition."
"Investigation of a series of oxidized nitridomanganese(V) salen complexes with different para ring substituents (R = CF3, tBu, and NMe2) demonstrates that nitride activation is dictated by remote ligand electronics. For R = CF3 and tBu, oxidation affords a Mn(VI) species and nitride activation, with dinitrogen homocoupling accelerated by the more electron-withdrawing CF3 substituent. Employing an electron-donating substituent (R = NMe2) results in a localized ligand radical species that is resistant to N coupling of the nitrides and is stable in solution at both 195 and 298 K."
"A highly enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed allylic alkylation of prochiral \xce\xb1,\xce\xb1-disubstituted aldehyde enolates with allyl benzoate is described. This protocol provides a novel approach for the synthesis of acyclic quaternary carbon stereogenic centers and it represents the first example of the direct enantioselective alkylation of an aldehyde enolate per se. The versatility of the \xce\xb1-quaternary aldehyde products is demonstrated through their conversion to a variety of useful motifs applicable to target-directed synthesis. Finally, mechanistic studies indicate that high levels of asymmetric induction are achieved from a mixture of prochiral (E)- and (Z)-enolates, which provides an exciting development for this type of transformation."
"In spite of widespread interest in rotaxane-based molecular machines and materials, rotaxanes have not been attached covalently to proteins. We describe the near-quantitative aqueous synthesis of [2]rotaxanes based on neutral and charged aqueous hosts\xe2\x80\x94cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) and cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT4+), respectively\xe2\x80\x94using the thiol-ene addition of cysteine and maleimide as a stoppering protocol. After verifying the high efficiency of the reaction using glutathione (GSH) as an oligopeptide stopper, we have employed cytochrome C (CytC) as a protein stopper to produce the first well-characterized protein-rotaxane bioconjugates. We anticipate that this methodology will enable the preparation of novel materials that combine the unique properties of proteins and mechanical bonds."
"Glycoproteins have vast structural diversity that plays an important role in many biological processes and have great potential as disease biomarkers. Here, we report a novel functionalized reverse phase protein array (RPPA), termed polymer-based reverse phase glycoprotein array (polyGPA), to capture and profile glycoproteomes specifically, and validate glycoproteins. Nitrocellulose membrane functionalized with globular hydroxyaminodendrimers was used to covalently capture preoxidized glycans on glycoproteins from complex protein samples such as biofluids. The captured glycoproteins were subsequently detected using the same validated antibodies as in RPPA. We demonstrated the outstanding specificity, sensitivity, and quantitative capabilities of polyGPA by capturing and detecting purified as well as endogenous \xce\xb1-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) in human plasma. We further applied quantitative N-glycoproteomics and the strategy to validate a panel of glycoproteins identified as potential biomarkers for bladder cancer by analyzing urine glycoproteins from bladder cancer patients or matched healthy individuals."
"Treatment of benzofurans with bis(pinacolato)diboron and Cs2CO3 under nickel-NHC catalysis resulted in the insertion of a boron atom into the C2\xe2\x80\x93O bond of benzofurans to afford the corresponding oxaborins. The scope of benzofuran substrates is wide, and the reactions proceeded without loss of functional groups such as fluoro, methoxy, and ester that are potentially reactive under nickel catalysis. The boron-inserted products proved to be useful building blocks and subsequently underwent a series of transformations, one of which led to the synthesis of fluorescent \xcf\x80-expanded oxaborins."
"Adopting the concept of procarrier for the first time, we demonstrated the controlled transport of chloride ions across lipid and cellular membranes. Procarriers containing highly hydrophilic appendages were initially inactive due to the lack of their partitioning into lipophilic membranes but were activated to transport chloride ions in the presence of specific enzymes that were able to hydrolyze off the appendages to generate an active carrier under specific conditions. Namely, the procarrier with an ester-bond-linked appendage was most activated by an esterase (PLE) at pH = 7.4, whereas the procarrier with a glycosyl-bond-linked appendage was activated only by a glycosylase (AOG) under slightly acidic conditions (pH = 5.5\xe2\x80\x936). In addition to controlling chloride transport, hydrophilic appendages greatly increase the water solubility of the procarrier, which may improve the deliverability of a hydrophobic active carrier into a plasma membrane."
"Many cell signaling events are coordinated by intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) that undergo multisite Serine/Threonine phosphorylation. The conformational properties of these IDRs prior to and following multisite phosphorylation are directly relevant to understanding their functions. Here, we present results from biophysical studies and molecular simulations that quantify the conformational properties of an 81-residue IDR from the S.\xc2\xa0cerevisiae transcription factor Ash1. We show that the unphosphorylated Ash1 IDR adopts coil-like conformations that are expanded and well-solvated. This result contradicts inferences regarding global compaction that are derived from heuristics based on amino acid compositions for IDRs with low proline contents. Upon phosphorylation at ten distinct sites, the global conformational properties of pAsh1 are indistinguishable from those of unphosphorylated Ash1. This insensitivity derives from compensatory changes to the pattern of local and long-range intrachain contacts. We show that the conformational properties of Ash1 and pAsh1 can be explained in terms of the linear sequence patterning of proline and charged residues vis-\xc3\xa0-vis all other residues. The sequence features of the Ash1 IDR are shared by many other IDRs that undergo multisite phosphorylation. Accordingly, we propose that our findings might be generalizable to other IDRs involved in cell signaling."
"Two-dimensional (2D) electrides, emerging as a new type of layered material whose electrons are confined in interlayer spaces instead of at atomic proximities, are receiving interest for their high performance in various (opto)electronics and catalytic applications. Experimentally, however, 2D electrides have been only found in a couple of layered nitrides and carbides. Here, we report new thermodynamically stable alkaline-earth based 2D electrides by using a first-principles global structure optimization method, phonon spectrum analysis, and molecular dynamics simulation. The method was applied to binary compounds consisting of alkaline-earth elements as cations and group VA, VIA, or VIIA nonmetal elements as anions. We revealed that the stability of a layered 2D electride structure is closely related to the cation/anion size ratio; stable 2D electrides possess a sufficiently large cation/anion size ratio to minimize electrostatic energy among cations, anions, and anionic electrons. Our work demonstrates a new avenue to the discovery of thermodynamically stable 2D electrides beyond experimental material databases and provides new insight into the principles of electride design."
"The M2 proton channel of influenza A virus is an integral membrane protein involved in the acidification of the viral interior, a step necessary for the release of the viral genetic material and replication of new virions. The aim of this study is to explore the mechanism of drug (un)binding to the M2 channel in order to gain insight into the structural and energetic features relevant for the development of novel inhibitors. To this end, we have investigated the binding of amantadine (Amt) to the wild type (wt) M2 channel and its V27A variant using multiple independent molecular dynamics simulations, exploratory conventional metadynamics, and multiple-walkers well-tempered metadynamics calculations. The results allow us to propose a sequential mechanism for the (un)binding of Amt to the wt M2 channel, which involves the adoption of a transiently populated intermediate (up state) leading to the thermodynamically favored down binding mode in the channel pore. Furthermore, they suggest that chloride anions play a relevant role in stabilizing the down binding mode of Amt to the wt channel, giving rise to a kinetic trapping that explains the experimentally observed pseudoirreversible inhibition of the wt channel by Amt. We propose that this trapping mechanism underlies the inhibitory activity of potent M2 channel blockers, as supported by the experimental confirmation of the irreversible binding of a pyrrolidine analogue from electrophysiological current assays. Finally, the results reveal that the thermodynamics and kinetics of Amt (un)binding is very sensitive to the V27A mutation, providing a quantitative rationale to the drastic decrease in inhibitory potency against the V27A variant. Overall, these findings pave the way to explore the inhibitory activity of Amt-related analogues in mutated M2 channel variants, providing guidelines for the design of novel inhibitors against resistant virus strains."
"Two new conjugated porphyrin-based systems (dimers 3 and 4) endowed with suitable crown ethers have been synthesized as receptors for a fullerene-ammonium salt derivative (1). Association constants in solution have been determined by UV\xe2\x80\x93vis titration experiments in CH2Cl2 at room temperature. The designed hosts are able to associate up to two fullerene-based guest molecules and present association constants as high as \xe2\x88\xbc5 \xc3\x97 108 M\xe2\x80\x931. Calculation of the allosteric cooperative factor \xce\xb1 for supramolecular complexes [3\xc2\xb712] and [4\xc2\xb712] showed a negative cooperative effect in both cases. The interactions accounting for the formation of the associates are based, first, on the complementary ammonium-crown ether interaction and, second, on the \xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93\xcf\x80 interactions between the porphyrin rings and the C60 moieties. Theoretical calculations have evidenced a significant decrease of the electron density in the porphyrin dimers 3 and 4 upon complexation of the first C60 molecule, in good agreement with the negative cooperativity found in these systems. This negative effect is partially compensated by the stabilizing C60\xe2\x80\x93C60 interactions that take place in the more stable syn-disposition of [4\xc2\xb712]."
"Establishing efficient synthetic pathways for microbial production of biochemicals is often hampered by competing pathways and/or insufficient precursor supply. Compartmentalization in cellular organelles can isolate synthetic pathways from competing pathways, and provide a compact and suitable environment for biosynthesis. Peroxisomes are cellular organelles where fatty acids are degraded, a process that is inhibited under typical fermentation conditions making them an interesting workhouse for production of fatty-acid-derived molecules. Here, we show that targeting synthetic pathways to peroxisomes can increase the production of fatty-acid-derived fatty alcohols, alkanes and olefins up to 700%. In addition, we demonstrate that biosynthesis of these chemicals in the peroxisomes results in significantly decreased accumulation of byproducts formed by competing enzymes. We further demonstrate that production can be enhanced up to 3-fold by increasing the peroxisome population. The strategies described here could be used for production of other chemicals, especially acyl-CoA-derived molecules."
"The development of nonaqueous redox flow batteries (NRFBs) has been impeded by a lack of electroactive compounds (anolytes and catholytes) with the necessary combination of (1) redox potentials that exceed the potential limits of water, (2) high solubility in nonaqueous media, and (3) high stability toward electrochemical cycling. In addition, ideal materials would maintain all three of these properties over multiple electron transfer events, thereby providing a proportional increase in storage capacity. This paper describes the mechanism-based design of a new class of metal-coordination complexes (MCCs) as anolytes for NRFBs. The tridentate bipyridylimino isoindoline (BPI) ligands of these complexes were designed to enable multielectron redox events. These molecules were optimized using a combination of systematic variation of the BPI ligand and the metal center along with mechanistic investigations of the decomposition pathways that occur during electrochemical cycling. Ultimately, these studies led to the identification of nickel BPI complexes that could undergo stable charge-discharge cycling (<5% capacity loss over 200 cycles) as well as a derivative that possesses the previously unprecedented combination of high solubility (>700 mM in CH3CN), multiple electron transfers at low redox potentials (\xe2\x80\x931.7 and \xe2\x80\x931.9 V versus Ag/Ag+), and high stability in the charged state for days at high concentration. Overall, the studies described herein have enabled the identification of a promising anolyte candidate for NRFBs and have also provided key insights into chemical design principles for future classes of MCC-based anolytes."
"Understanding the fundamental principles underlying supramolecular self-assembly may facilitate many developments, from novel antivirals to self-organized nanodevices. Icosahedral virus particles constitute paradigms to study self-assembly using a combination of theory and experiment. Unfortunately, assembly pathways of the structurally simplest virus capsids, those more accessible to detailed theoretical studies, have been difficult to study experimentally. We have enabled the in vitro self-assembly under close to physiological conditions of one of the simplest virus particles known, the minute virus of mice (MVM) capsid, and experimentally analyzed its pathways of assembly and disassembly. A combination of electron microscopy and high-resolution atomic force microscopy was used to structurally characterize and quantify a succession of transient assembly and disassembly intermediates. The results provided an experiment-based model for the reversible self-assembly pathway of a most simple (T = 1) icosahedral protein shell. During assembly, trimeric capsid building blocks are sequentially added to the growing capsid, with pentamers of building blocks and incomplete capsids missing one building block as conspicuous intermediates. This study provided experimental verification of many features of self-assembly of a simple T = 1 capsid predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. It also demonstrated atomic force microscopy imaging and automated analysis, in combination with electron microscopy, as a powerful single-particle approach to characterize at high resolution and quantify transient intermediates during supramolecular self-assembly/disassembly reactions. Finally, the efficient in vitro self-assembly achieved for the oncotropic, cell nucleus-targeted MVM capsid may facilitate its development as a drug-encapsidating nanoparticle for anticancer targeted drug delivery."
"The concurrence of enzymatic reaction and ligand\xe2\x80\x93receptor interactions is common for proteins, but rare for small molecules and has yet to be explored. Here we show that ligand\xe2\x80\x93receptor interaction modulates the morphology of molecular assemblies formed by enzyme-instructed assembly of small molecules. While the absence of ligand\xe2\x80\x93receptor interaction allows enzymatic dephosphorylation of a precursor to generate the hydrogelator that self-assembles to form long nanofibers, the presence of the ligand\xe2\x80\x93receptor interaction biases the pathway to form precipitous aggregates containing short nanofibers. While the hydrogelators self-assemble to form nanofibers or nanoribbons that are unable to bind with the ligand (i.e., vancomycin), the addition of surfactant breaks up the assemblies to restore the ligand\xe2\x80\x93receptor interaction. In addition, an excess amount of the ligands can disrupt the nanofibers and result in the precipitates. As the first example of the use of ligand\xe2\x80\x93receptor interaction to modulate the kinetics of enzymatic self-assembly, this work not only provides a solution to evaluate the interaction between aggregates and target molecules but also offers new insight for understanding the emergent behavior of sophisticated molecular systems having multiple and parallel processes."
"Perylene-tethered pillar[5]arenes and C60\xe2\x80\x93boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyads were synthesized acting as emitters and organic triplet photosensitizers, respectively, for the purpose of improving the efficiency of triplet\xe2\x80\x93triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC). The photophysical properties of the sensitizers (guests) and the emitters (hosts) were not greatly influenced by the chemical modifications except for a notable decrease in the fluorescence quantum yields of the perlyene emitters due to the high local concentration. The perylene-tethered pillar[5]arenes form stable 1:1 complexes with a nitrile-bearing C60\xe2\x80\x93BODIPY dyad, showing association constants as high as 4.0 \xc3\x97 104 M\xe2\x80\x931. Through host\xe2\x80\x93guest complexation, the efficiencies of both triplet\xe2\x80\x93triplet energy transfer and TTA were significantly enhanced, which overcompensated for the loss of the fluorescence quantum yield of the emitters (hosts). Thus, an improved TTA-UC efficiency of 3.2% was observed even at a diluted concentration of 6 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x935 M, demonstrating for the first time the effectiveness of the supramolecular motif for enhancing TTA-UC without varying the inherent photophysical properties of sensitizers and emitters."
"The mononuclear Mn(IV)-oxo complex [MnIV(O)(N4py)]2+, where N4py is the pentadentate ligand N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-N-bis(2-pyridyl)methylamine, has been proposed to attack C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds by an excited-state reactivity pattern [Cho, K.-B.; Shaik, S.; Nam, W.  J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2012, 3, 2851\xe2\x88\x922856 (DOI: 10.1021/jz301241z)]. In this model, a 4E excited state is utilized to provide a lower-energy barrier for hydrogen-atom transfer. This proposal is intriguing, as it offers both a rationale for the relatively high hydrogen-atom-transfer reactivity of [MnIV(O)(N4py)]2+ and a guideline for creating more reactive complexes through ligand modification. Here we employ a combination of electronic absorption and variable-temperature magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy to experimentally evaluate this excited-state reactivity model. Using these spectroscopic methods, in conjunction with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and complete-active space self-consistent-field calculations (CASSCF), we define the ligand-field and charge-transfer excited states of [MnIV(O)(N4py)]2+. Through a graphical analysis of the signs of the experimental C-term MCD signals, we unambiguously assign a low-energy MCD feature of [MnIV(O)(N4py)]2+ as the 4E excited state predicted to be involved in hydrogen-atom-transfer reactivity. The CASSCF calculations predict enhanced MnIII-oxyl character on the excited-state 4E surface, consistent with previous DFT calculations. Potential-energy surfaces, developed using the CASSCF methods, are used to determine how the energies and wave functions of the ground and excited states evolved as a function of Mn\xe2\x95\x90O distance. The unique insights into ground- and excited-state electronic structure offered by these spectroscopic and computational studies are harmonized with a thermodynamic model of hydrogen-atom-transfer reactivity, which predicts a correlation between transition-state barriers and driving force."
"Stability of detergent-solubilized G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is crucial for their purification in a biologically relevant state, and it is well-known that short chain detergents such as octylglucoside are more denaturing than long chain detergents such as dodecylmaltoside. However, the molecular basis for this phenomenon is poorly understood. To gain insights into the mechanism of detergent destabilization of GPCRs, we used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of thermostabilized adenosine receptor (A2AR) mutants embedded in either a lipid bilayer or detergent micelles of alkylmaltosides and alkylglucosides. A2AR mutants in dodecylmaltoside or phospholipid showed low flexibility and good interhelical packing. In contrast, A2AR mutants in either octylglucoside or nonylglucoside showed decreased \xce\xb1-helicity in transmembrane regions, decreased \xce\xb1-helical packing, and the interpenetration of detergent molecules between transmembrane \xce\xb1-helices. This was not observed in octylglucoside containing phospholipid. Cholesteryl hemisuccinate in dodecylmaltoside increased the energetic stability of the receptor by wedging into crevices on the hydrophobic surface of A2AR, increasing packing interactions within the receptor and stiffening the detergent micelle. The data suggest a three-stage process for the initial events in the destabilization of GPCRs by octylglucoside: (i) highly mobile detergent molecules form small micelles around the receptor; (ii) loss of \xce\xb1-helicity and decreased interhelical packing interactions in transmembrane regions are promoted by increased receptor thermal motion; (iii) transient separation of transmembrane helices allowed penetration of detergent molecules into the core of the receptor. The relative hydration of the headgroup and alkyl chain correlates with detergent harshness and suggests new avenues to develop milder versions of octylglucoside for receptor crystallization."
"In cancer plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT), plasmonic nanoparticles are used to convert light into localized heat, leading to cancer cell death. Among plasmonic nanoparticles, gold nanorods (AuNRs) with specific dimensions enabling them to absorb near-infrared laser light have been widely used. The detailed mechanism of PPTT therapy, however, still remains poorly understood. Typically, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been used to detect time-dependent changes in the intensity of the vibration frequencies of molecules that appear or disappear during different cellular processes. A complete proven assignment of the molecular identity of these vibrations and their biological importance has not yet been accomplished. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful technique that is able to accurately identify molecules in chemical mixtures by observing their m/z values and fragmentation patterns. Here, we complemented the study of changes in SERS spectra with MS-based metabolomics and proteomics to identify the chemical species responsible for the observed changes in SERS band intensities during PPTT. We observed an increase in intensity of the bands at around 1000, 1207, and 1580 cm\xe2\x80\x931, which were assigned in the literature to phenylalanine, albeit with dispute. Our metabolomics results showed increased levels of phenylalanine, its derivatives, and phenylalanine-containing peptides, providing evidence for more confidence in the SERS peak assignments. To better understand the mechanism of phenylalanine increase upon PPTT, we combined metabolomics and proteomics results through network analysis, which proved that phenylalanine metabolism was perturbed. Furthermore, several apoptosis pathways were activated via key proteins (e.g., HADHA and ACAT1), consistent with the proposed role of altered phenylalanine metabolism in inducing apoptosis. Our study shows that the integration of the SERS with MS-based metabolomics and proteomics can assist the assignment of signals in SERS spectra and further characterize the related molecular mechanisms of the cellular processes involved in PPTT."
"The widespread implementation of high-energy-density lithium metal batteries has long been fettered by lithium dendrite-related failure. Here we report a new strategy to address the issue of dendrite growth by a polyimide-coating layer with vertical nanoscale channels of high aspect ratio. Smooth, granular lithium metal was deposited on the modified electrode instead of typical filamentary growths. In a comparison with the bare planar electrode, the modified electrode achieved greatly enhanced Coulombic efficiency and longer cycle life. Homogeneous Li+ flux distribution above the modified electrode from the nanochannel confinement can account for a uniform Li nucleation and a nondendrite growth. We also demonstrated that the polyimide coating with microscale pores loses the confinement effects and fails to suppress lithium dendrites. This strategy of spatially defined lithium growth in vertical-aligned nanochannels provides a novel approach and a significant step toward stabilizing Li metal anodes."
"Metalloporphyrins not only are vital in biological systems but also are valuable catalysts in organic synthesis. On the other hand, catalytic properties of free base porphyrins have been less explored. They are mostly known as efficient photosensitizers for the generation of singlet oxygen via photoinduced energy transfer processes, but under light irradiation, they can also participate in electron transfer processes. Indeed, we have found that free base tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP) is an efficient photoredox catalyst for the reaction of aldehydes with diazo compounds leading to \xce\xb1-alkylated derivatives. The performance of a porphyrin catalyst can be optimized by tailoring various substituents at the periphery of the macrocycle at both the \xce\xb2 and meso positions. This allows for the fine tuning of their optical and electrochemical properties and hence their catalytic activity."
"Because of growing environmental concerns, the development of lead-free piezoelectric materials with enhanced properties has become of great interest. Here, we report a giant piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 550 pC/N and a high Curie temperature (TC) of 237 \xc2\xb0C in (1\xe2\x80\x93x\xe2\x80\x93y)K1\xe2\x80\x93wNawNb1\xe2\x80\x93zSbzO3\xe2\x80\x93xBiFeO3\xe2\x80\x93yBi0.5Na0.5ZrO3 (KNwNSz-xBF-yBNZ) ceramics by optimizing x, y, z, and w. Atomic-resolution polarization mapping by Z-contrast imaging reveals the intimate coexistence of rhombohedral (R) and tetragonal (T) phases inside nanodomains, that is, a structural origin for the R\xe2\x80\x93T phase boundary in the present KNN system. Hence, the physical origin of high piezoelectric performance can be attributed to a nearly vanishing polarization anisotropy and thus low domain wall energy, facilitating easy polarization rotation between different states under an external field."
"Mass transport of oxygen through an ionomer contained within the cathode catalyst layer in an anion exchange membrane fuel cell is critical for a functioning fuel cell, yet is relatively unexplored. Moreover, because water is a reactant in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, an adequate supply of water is required. In this work, ORR mass transport behavior is reported for methylated hexamethyl-p-terphenyl polymethylbenzimidazoles (HMT-PMBI), charge balanced by hydroxide ions (IEC from 2.1 to 2.5 mequiv/g), and commercial Fumatec FAA-3 membranes. Electrochemical mass transport parameters are determined by potential step chronoamperometry using a Pt microdisk solid-state electrochemical cell, in air at 60 \xc2\xb0C, with relative humidity controlled between 70% and 98%. The oxygen diffusion coefficient (DbO2), oxygen concentration (cbO2), and oxygen permeability (DbO2\xc2\xb7cbO2) were obtained by nonlinear curve fitting of the current transients using the Shoup\xe2\x80\x93Szabo equation. Mass transport parameters are correlated to water content of the ionomer membrane. It is found that the oxygen diffusion coefficients decreased by 2 orders of magnitude upon reducing the water content of the ionomer membrane by lowering the relative humidity. The limitation of the Shoup\xe2\x80\x93Szabo equation for extracting ORR mass transport parameters using thin ionomer films was evaluated by numerical modeling of the current transients, which revealed that a significant discrepancy (up to 29% under present conditions) was evident for highly hydrated membranes for which the oxygen diffusion coefficient was largest, and in which the oxygen depletion region reached the ionomer/gas interface during the chronoamperometric analysis."
"A concise asymmetric synthesis of an 11\xce\xb2-HSD-1 inhibitor has been achieved using inexpensive starting materials with excellent step-economy at low catalyst loadings. The catalytic enantioselective total synthesis of 1 was accomplished in 7 steps and 38% overall yield aided by the development of an innovative, sequential strategy involving Pd-catalyzed pyridinium C\xe2\x80\x93H arylation and Ir-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of the resulting fused tricyclic indenopyridinium salt highlighted by the use of a unique P,N-ligand (MeO-BoQPhos) with 1000 ppm of [Ir(COD)Cl]2."
"We report a simple one-pot protocol that affords functionalization of N-CH3 groups in N-methyl-N,N-dialkylamines with high selectivity over N-CH2R or N-CHR2 groups. The radical cation DABCO+\xe2\x80\xa2, prepared in situ by oxidation of DABCO with a triarylaminium salt, effects highly selective and contra-thermodynamic C\xe2\x80\x93H abstraction from N-CH3 groups. The intermediates that result react in situ with organometallic nucleophiles in a single pot, affording novel and highly selective homologation of N-CH3 groups. Chemoselectivity, scalability, and recyclability of reagents are demonstrated, and a mechanistic proposal is corroborated by computational and experimental results. The utility of the transformation is demonstrated in the late-stage site-selective functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals, allowing rapid derivatization for investigation of structure\xe2\x80\x93activity relationships."
"Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), quasi-one-dimensional graphene strips, have shown great potential for nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics, and photonics. Atomically precise GNRs can be \xe2\x80\x9cbottom-up\xe2\x80\x9d synthesized by surface-assisted assembly of molecular building blocks under ultra-high-vacuum conditions. However, large-scale and efficient synthesis of such GNRs at low cost remains a significant challenge. Here we report an efficient \xe2\x80\x9cbottom-up\xe2\x80\x9d chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for inexpensive and high-throughput growth of structurally defined GNRs with varying structures under ambient-pressure conditions. The high quality of our CVD-grown GNRs is validated by a combination of different spectroscopic and microscopic characterizations. Facile, large-area transfer of GNRs onto insulating substrates and subsequent device fabrication demonstrate their promising potential as semiconducting materials, exhibiting high current on/off ratios up to 6000 in field-effect transistor devices. This value is 3 orders of magnitude higher than values reported so far for other thin-film transistors of structurally defined GNRs. Notably, on-surface mass spectrometry analyses of polymer precursors provide unprecedented evidence for the chemical structures of the resulting GNRs, especially the heteroatom doping and heterojunctions. These results pave the way toward the scalable and controllable growth of GNRs for future applications."
"Conjugated polymers are complex multichromophore systems, with emission properties strongly dependent on the electronic energy transfer through active subunits. Although the packing of the conjugated chains in the solid state is known to be a key factor to tailor the electronic energy transfer and the resulting optical properties, most of the current solution-based processing methods do not allow for effectively controlling the molecular order, thus making the full unveiling of energy transfer mechanisms very complex. Here we report on conjugated polymer fibers with tailored internal molecular order, leading to a significant enhancement of the emission quantum yield. Steady state and femtosecond time-resolved polarized spectroscopies evidence that excitation is directed toward those chromophores oriented along the fiber axis, on a typical time scale of picoseconds. These aligned and more extended chromophores, resulting from the high stretching rate and electric field applied during the fiber spinning process, lead to improved emission properties. Conjugated polymer fibers are relevant to develop optoelectronic plastic devices with enhanced and anisotropic properties."
Scientists study the biosynthesis of a thiopeptide to better understand how to bioengineer modified peptides to form novel antibiotics.
"The biosynthesis of the thiopeptide thiomuracin is a well-orchestrated process involving a multitude of posttranslational modifications. We show that six Cys residues of a precursor peptide are first cyclodehydrated and oxidized to thiazoles in an ordered, but nonlinear fashion that is leader-peptide-dependent. Then four alcohols are glutamylated and converted to alkenes in a C-to-N terminal directional process that is leader-peptide-independent. Finally, two of these alkenes undergo a formal [4 + 2] cycloaddition to form a trithiazole-substituted pyridine macrocycle. We describe here the factors that govern the substrate specificity and order of biosynthetic events that turn a ribosomal peptide into a powerful antibiotic."
"Genomic and metagenomic investigations have recently led to the delineation of a novel class of natural products called ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). RiPPs are ubiquitous among living organisms and include pharmaceutically relevant compounds such as antibiotics and toxins. A prominent example is polytheonamide A, which exhibits numerous post-translational modifications, some of which were unknown in ribosomal peptides until recently. Among these post-translational modifications, C-methylations have been proposed to be catalyzed by two putative radical S-adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzymes, PoyB and PoyC. Here we report the in vitro activity of PoyC, the first B12-dependent rSAM enzyme catalyzing peptide C\xce\xb2-methylation. We show that PoyC catalyzes the formation of S-adenosylhomocysteine and 5\xe2\x80\xb2-deoxyadenosine and the transfer of a methyl group to l-valine residue. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that B12-rSAM enzymes have a tightly bound MeCbl cofactor that during catalysis transfers a methyl group originating from S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Collectively, our results shed new light on polytheonamide biosynthesis and the large and emerging family of B12-rSAM enzymes."
"The imine linkages of two layered, porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs), TPB-TP-COF ([C6H3(C6H4N)3]2[C6H4(CH)2]3, 1) and 4PE-1P-COF ([C2(C6H4N)4][C6H4(CH)2]2, 2), have been transformed into amide linkages to make the respective isostructural amide COFs 1\xe2\x80\xb2 and 2\xe2\x80\xb2 by direct oxidation with retention of crystallinity and permanent porosity. Remarkably, the oxidation of both imine COFs is complete, as assessed by FT-IR and 13C CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy and demonstrates (a) the first chemical conversion of a COF linkage and (b) how the usual \xe2\x80\x9ccrystallization problem\xe2\x80\x9d encountered in COF chemistry can be bypassed to access COFs, such as these amides, that are typically thought to be difficult to obtain by the usual de novo methods. The amide COFs show improved chemical stability relative to their imine progenitors."
"A thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-based electron acceptor, ATT-1, is designed and synthesized. ATT-1 exhibits a planar conjugated framework, broad absorption with a large absorption coefficient, and a slightly high LUMO energy level. Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on PTB7-Th electron donor and ATT-1 electron acceptor delivered power conversion efficiencies of up to 10.07%, which is among the best performances reported for non-fullerene BHJ solar cells using PTB7-Th as the electron donor."
"The ability to exert spatial and temporal control over a transition-metal catalyst offers diverse opportunities for the fabrication of functional materials. Using an external stimulus such as visible light to toggle a catalyst between an active and dormant state has proven to be an effective approach for controlled, radical methodologies. Outside of radical bond formation, there is a dearth of evidence that suggests traditional transition metal catalysis can similarly be controlled with visible light energy. Many cobalt complexes that catalyze the [2+2+2] cycloaddition are assisted by UV photolysis, but strict photocontrolled methods are unattainable due to high levels of thermally driven reactivity. Herein, we disclose the first light-controlled, cobalt-catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition via a dual cobalt and photoredox catalyst manifold. We demonstrate the power of this method with a spatially and temporally resolved technique for arene formation using photolithography."
"A catalytic hydroamidation of alkynes with isocyanates using alkyl bromides as hydride sources has been developed. The method turns parasitic \xce\xb2-hydride elimination into a strategic advantage, rapidly affording acrylamides with excellent chemo- and regioselectivity."
"Photoinitiated cationic polymerizations are widely used in industrial processes; however, gaining photocontrol over chain growth would expand the utility of these methods and facilitate the design of novel complex architectures. We report herein a cationic polymerization regulated by visible light. This polymerization proceeds under mild conditions: a combination of a metal-free photocatalyst, a chain-transfer agent, and light irradiation enables the synthesis of various poly(vinyl ether)s with good control over molecular weight and dispersity as well as excellent chain-end fidelity. Significantly, photoreversible cation formation in this system enables efficient control over polymer chain growth with light."
"A shape-persistent polyphenylene with a \xe2\x80\x9cspoked wheel\xe2\x80\x9d structure was synthesized as a subunit of an unprecedented two-dimensional polyphenylene that we name graphenylene. The synthesis was carried out through a sixfold intramolecular Yamamoto coupling of a dodecabromo-substituted dendritic polyphenylene precursor, which had a central hexaphenylbenzene unit as a template. Characterizations by NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry provided an unambiguous structural proof for the wheel-like molecule with a molar mass of 3815.4 g/mol. Remarkably, scanning tunneling microscopy visualization clearly revealed the defined spoked wheel structure of the molecule with six internal pores."
"This study represents the first example an environmentally benign, sustainable, and practical synthesis of substituted quinolines and pyrimidines using combinations of 2-aminobenzyl alcohols and alcohols as well as benzamidine and two different alcohols, respectively. These reactions proceed with high atom efficiency via a sequence of dehydrogenation and condensation steps that give rise to selective C\xe2\x80\x93C and C\xe2\x80\x93N bond formations, thereby releasing 2 equiv of hydrogen and water. A hydride Mn(I) PNP pincer complex recently developed in our laboratory catalyzes this process in a very efficient way. A total of 15 different quinolines and 14 different pyrimidines were synthesized in isolated yields of up to 91 and 90%, respectively."
"A novel enantioselective copper-catalyzed intermolecular cyanotrifluoromethylation of alkenes has been developed, in which a variety of CF3-containing alkylnitriles are furnished with excellent enantiomeric excess. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed (1) the reaction was initiated by a SET process between activated Togni\xe2\x80\x99s CF3+ reagent and a Cu(I) catalyst; (2) the released CF3 radical readily added to styrene to provide a benzylic radical, which was then trapped by a chiral Cu(II) cyanide species to deliver the desired alkylnitriles; (3) a low concentration of the CN anion was crucial to obtain high enantioselectivity."
"Recent work suggests that electrons can travel through DNA and other chiral molecules in a spin-selective manner, but little is known about the origin of this spin selectivity. Here we describe experiments on magnetized DNA-modified electrodes to explore spin-selective electron transport through hydrated duplex DNA. Our results show that the two spins migrate through duplex DNA with a different yield and that spin selectivity requires charge transport through the DNA duplex. Significantly, shifting the same duplex DNA between right-handed B- and left-handed Z-forms leads to a diode-like switch in spin selectivity; which spin moves more efficiently through the duplex depends upon the DNA helicity. With DNA, the supramolecular organization of chiral moieties, rather than the chirality of the individual monomers, determines the selectivity in spin, and thus a conformational change can switch the spin selectivity."
"The first total syntheses of aflavazole (6) and 14-hydroxyaflavinine (8), two sterically congested indole diterpenoids, were accomplished. AlI3-promoted alkyne Prins cyclization was exploited to construct their key structural motifs. An electrocyclization\xe2\x80\x93aromatization sequence assembled the pentasubstituted arene of 6, and a Stille\xe2\x80\x93Migita coupling furnished the tetrasubstituted olefin of 8. The benzylic and allylic C\xe2\x80\x93O bonds were reductively cleaved at the late stage of the syntheses, respectively."
"(\xe2\x88\x92)-Lomaiviticin A (1) is a C2-symmetric cytotoxin that contains two diazofluorene functional groups and which induces double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. Evidence suggests DNA cleavage is initiated by hydrogen atom abstraction from the deoxyribose backbone. Here we demonstrate the formation of the vinyl radicals 1\xc2\xb7 and 2\xc2\xb7 from 1 by 1,7-addition of thiols to the diazofluorenes. These radicals can affect hydrogen atom abstraction from methanol and acetone. The first addition of thiol to 1 proceeds at a much greater rate than the second. The diazosulfide 5 formed en route to 1\xc2\xb7 has been detected at \xe2\x88\x9250 \xc2\xb0C and undergoes decomposition to 1\xc2\xb7 with a half-life of 110 min at \xe2\x88\x9220 \xc2\xb0C under air. These data, which constitute the first direct evidence for the generation of 1\xc2\xb7 and 2\xc2\xb7 from 1, provide insights into the mechanism of DNA cleavage by 1."
"Precolibactins and colibactins represent a family of natural products that are encoded by the clb gene cluster and are produced by certain commensal, extraintestinal, and probiotic E. coli. clb+ E. coli induce megalocytosis and DNA double-strand breaks in eukaryotic cells, but paradoxically, this gene cluster is found in the probiotic Nissle 1917. Evidence suggests precolibactins are converted to genotoxic colibactins by colibactin peptidase (ClbP)-mediated cleavage of an N-acyl-d-Asn side chain, and all isolation efforts have employed \xce\x94clbP strains to facilitate accumulation of precolibactins. It was hypothesized that colibactins form unsaturated imines that alkylate DNA by cyclopropane ring opening (2 \xe2\x86\x92 3). However, as no colibactins have been isolated, this hypothesis has not been tested experimentally. Additionally, precolibactins A\xe2\x80\x93C (7\xe2\x80\x939) contain a pyridone that cannot generate the unsaturated imines that form the basis of this hypothesis. To resolve this, we prepared 13 synthetic colibactin derivatives and evaluated their DNA binding and alkylation activity. We show that unsaturated imines, but not the corresponding pyridone derivatives, potently alkylate DNA. The imine, unsaturated lactam, and cyclopropane are essential for efficient DNA alkylation. A cationic residue enhances activity. These studies suggest that precolibactins containing a pyridone are not responsible for the genotoxicity of the clb cluster. Instead, we propose that these are off-pathway fermentation products produced by a facile double cyclodehydration route that manifests in the absence of viable ClbP. The results presented herein provide a foundation to begin to connect metabolite structure with the disparate phenotypes associated with clb+ E. coli."
"Despite continuing interest in partly unfolded proteins as precursors for aggregation and adverse gain-of-function in human disease, there is yet little known about the local transitions of native structures that possibly lead to such intermediate states. To target this problem, we present here a protein-design strategy that allows real-time detection of rupture and swapping of complete secondary-structure elements in globular proteins\xe2\x80\x94molecular events that have previously been inaccessible experimental analysis. The approach is applied to the dynamic \xce\xb2-barrel of SOD1, associated with pathologic aggregation in the neurodegenerative disease ALS. Data show that rupture and re-insertion of individual \xce\xb2-strands do not take place locally but require the SOD1 barrel to unfold globally. The finding questions the very existence of partly unfolded intermediates in the SOD1 aggregation process and presents new clues to the mechanism by which hydrogen bonding maintains global structural integrity."
"Cyanide monolayers on Au{111} restructure from a hexagonal close-packed lattice to a mixed-orientation \xe2\x80\x9cribbon\xe2\x80\x9d structure through thermal annealing. The new surface structure loses most of the observed surface features characterizing the initial as-adsorbed system with \xe2\x80\x9cribbon\xe2\x80\x9d domain boundaries isolating rotationally offset surface regions where the orientation is guided by the underlying gold lattice. A blue shift to higher frequencies of the CN vibration to 2235\xc2\xa0cm\xe2\x80\x931 with respect to the as-adsorbed CN/Au{111} vibration at 2146 cm\xe2\x80\x931 is observed. In addition, a new low-frequency mode is observed at 145 cm\xe2\x80\x931, suggesting a chemical environment change similar to gold\xe2\x80\x93cyanide crystallization. We discuss this new structure with respect to a mixed cyanide/isocyanide monolayer and propose a bonding scheme consisting of Au-CN and Au-NC bound molecules that are oriented normal to the Au{111} surface."
"Protein synthesis (translation) is central to cellular function and antibiotic development. Interestingly, the key chemical step of translation, peptide bond formation, is among the slower enzymatic reactions. The reason for this remains controversial because of reliance on studies using highly modified, severely minimized, or unreactive substrate analogues. Here, we investigated this problem by fast kinetics using full-length aminoacyl-tRNA substrates with atomic substitutions that activated the ester electrophile. While trifluoro substitution of hydrogens in nonconserved positions of the peptidyl-site substrate dramatically increased the ester reactivity in solution assays, a large hastening of the combined rates of ribosomal accommodation and peptidyl transfer was observed only with a slowly reacting aminoacyl-site nucleophile, proline. With a fast-reacting A-site nucleophile, phenylalanine, effects did not correlate at all with electrophilicities. As effects were observed using the same, natural, aminoacyl-tRNA at the A site and all rates of accommodation/peptidyl transfer were pH dependent, we concluded that rate limitation was not by A-site accommodation but rather by peptidyl transfer and a hitherto unexpected step at the P site. This new slow step, which we term P-site accommodation, has implications for the activation or inhibition of ribosome function in vitro and in vivo."
"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in regulating various physiological and pathological processes. Developing fluorescent probes capable of detecting HDAC activity can help further elucidate the roles of HDACs in biology. In this study, we first developed a set of activity-based fluorescent probes by incorporating the Kac residue and the O-NBD group. Upon enzymatic removal of the acetyl group in the Kac residue, the released free amine reacted intramolecularly with the O-NBD moiety, resulting in turn-on fluorescence. These designed probes are capable of detecting HDAC activity in a continuous fashion, thereby eliminating the extra step of fluorescence development. Remarkably, the amount of turn-on fluorescence can be as high as 50-fold, which is superior to the existing one-step HDAC fluorescent probes. Inhibition experiments further proved that the probes can serve as useful tools for screening HDAC inhibitors. Building on these results, we moved on and designed a dual-purpose fluorescent probe by introducing a diazirine photo-cross-linker into the probe. The resulting probe was not only capable of reporting enzymatic activity but also able to directly identify and capture the protein targets from the complex cellular environment. By combining a fluorometric method and in-gel fluorescence scanning technique, we found that epigenetic readers and erasers can be readily identified and differentiated using a single probe. This is not achievable with traditional photoaffinity probes. In light of the prominent properties and the diverse functions of this newly developed probe, we envision that it can provide a robust tool for functional analysis of HDACs and facilitate future drug discovery in epigenetics."
"The realization of artificial photosynthesis carries the promise of cheap and abundant energy, however, significant advances in the rational design of water oxidation catalysts are required. Detailed information on the structure of the catalyst under reaction conditions and mechanisms of O\xe2\x80\x93O bond formation should be obtained. Here, we used a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), stopped flow freeze quench on a millisecond\xe2\x80\x93second time scale, X-ray absorption (XAS), resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) to follow the dynamics of the Ru-based single site catalyst, [RuII(NPM)(4-pic)2(H2O)]2+ (NPM = 4-t-butyl-2,6-di(1\xe2\x80\xb2,8\xe2\x80\xb2-naphthyrid-2\xe2\x80\xb2-yl)pyridine, pic = 4-picoline), under the water oxidation conditions. We report a unique EPR signal with g-tensor, gx = 2.30, gy = 2.18, and gz = 1.83 which allowed us to observe fast dynamics of oxygen atom transfer from the RuIV\xe2\x95\x90O oxo species to the uncoordinated nitrogen of the NPM ligand. In few seconds, the NPM ligand modification results in [RuIII(NPM-NO)(4-pic)2(H2O)]3+ and [RuIII(NPM-NO,NO)(4-pic)2]3+ complexes. A proposed [RuV(NPM)(4-pic)2\xe2\x95\x90O]3+ intermediate was not detected under the tested conditions. We demonstrate that while the proximal base might be beneficial in O\xe2\x80\x93O bond formation via nucleophilic water attack on an oxo species as shown by DFT, the noncoordinating nitrogen is impractical as a base in water oxidation catalysts due to its facile conversion to the N\xe2\x80\x93O group. This study opens new horizons for understanding the real structure of Ru catalysts under water oxidation conditions and points toward the need to further investigate the role of the N\xe2\x80\x93O ligand in promoting water oxidation catalysis."
"Generally, the long-range electronic communication between spatially orthogonal orbitals is inefficient and limited to field and inductive effects. In this work, we provide experimental evidence that such communication can be achieved via intramolecular electron transfer between two degenerate and mutually orthogonal frontier molecular orbitals (MOs) at the transition state. Interaction between orthogonal orbitals is amplified when the energy gap between these orbitals approaches zero, or at an \xe2\x80\x9corbital crossing\xe2\x80\x9d. The crossing between two empty or two fully occupied MOs, which do not lead to stabilization, can be \xe2\x80\x9cactivated\xe2\x80\x9d when one of the empty MOs is populated (i.e., electron injection) or one of the filled MOs is depopulated (i.e., hole injection). In reductive cycloaromatization reactions, such crossings define transition states with energies defined by both the in-plane and out-of-plane \xcf\x80-systems. Herein, we provide experimental evidence for the utility of this concept using orbital crossings in reductive C1\xe2\x80\x93C5 cycloaromatization reactions of enediynes. Communication with remote substituents via orbital crossings greatly enhances regioselectivity of the ring closure step in comparison to the analogous radical cyclizations. We also present photophysical data pertaining to the efficiency of electron injection into the benzannelated enediynes."
"Ever since the axial chiral catalysts were developed for asymmetric reactions with excellent chiral discrimination and high efficiencies, the interest in the supramolecular catalyst has also been extensively investigated. Here, with a hint from the typical molecular catalyst, we developed a series of metal-coordinated nanotube (M-helical nanotube, M-HN) catalysts for asymmetric reactions. The M-HN catalyst was fabricated on the basis of the self-assembly of an l-glutamic acid terminated bolaamphiphile, which formed a single-walled nanotube. On one hand, through the coordination of transition metal ions with the carboxylic acid groups on the nanotube surface, a wide variety of single-walled M-HN catalysts could be fabricated, in which the coordination sites could serve as the catalytic sites. On the other hand, using a slight amount of these catalysts, significant reactivity and enantioselectivity were realized for certain asymmetric reactions under mild conditions. Remarkably, Bi(III)-HN could catalyze the asymmetric Mukaiyama aldol reaction with high enantioselectivity (up to 97% ee) in an aqueous system; Cu(II)-HN catalyzed the asymmetric Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder reaction with up to 91% ee within 60 min. It was suggested that a synergetic effect of the aligned multicatalytic sites and stereochemical selectivity of the M-HN lead to an excellent catalytic performance. Through this work, we proposed a new concept of a single-walled nanotube as catalyst and showed the first example of nanotube catalysts presenting high reactivity and enantioselectivity that rivaled a chiral molecular catalyst."
"A novel co-reactant-free electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) system is developed where Ru(bpy)32+ emission is obtained on boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes. The method exploits the unique ability of BDD to operate at very high oxidation potential in aqueous solutions and to promote the conversion of inert SO42\xe2\x80\x93 into the reactive co-reactant S2O82\xe2\x80\x93. This novel procedure is rather straightforward, not requiring any particular electrode geometry, and since the co-reactant is only generated in situ, the interference with biological samples is minimized. The underlying mechanism is similar to that of the Ru(bpy)32+/S2O82\xe2\x80\x93 system; however, the intensity of the emitted signal increases linearly with [SO42\xe2\x80\x93] up to \xe2\x88\xbc0.6 M, with possible implications for analytical uses of the proposed procedure."
"Herein, the combined application of characterization tools, such as Raman spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry, and optical and atomic force microscopy, confirms the reductive silylation of synthetic carbon allotropes as a new covalent functionalization strategy for the formation of heteroatom\xe2\x80\x93carbon bonds. In particular, our study gives interesting insights into the topology-driven retrofunctionalization of nanotubide and graphenide derivatives."
"The ability to form triplet excited states upon two-photon excitation is important for several applications of metalloporphyrins, including two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM) and two-photon photodynamic therapy (PDT). Here we analyzed one-photon (1P) and degenerate two-photon (2P) absorption properties of several phosphorescent Pt (II) porphyrins, focusing on the effects of aromatic \xcf\x80-extension and peripheral substitution on triplet emissivity and two-photon absorption (2PA). Our 2PA measurements for the first time made use of direct time-resolved detection of phosphorescence, having the ability to efficiently reject laser background through microsecond time gating. \xcf\x80-Extension of the porphyrin macrocycle by way of syn-fusion with two external aromatic fragments, such as in syn-dibenzo- (DBP) and syn-dinaphthoporphyrins (DNP), lowers the symmetry of the porphyrin skeleton. As a result, DBPs and DNPs exhibit stronger 2PA into the one-photon-allowed B (Soret) and Q states than fully symmetric (D4h) nonextended porphyrins. However, much more 2P-active states lie above the B state and cannot be accessed due to the interfering linear absorption. Alkoxycarbonyl groups (CO2R) in the benzo-rings dramatically enhance 2PA near the B state level. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations in combinations with the sum-over-states (SOS) formalism revealed that the enhancement is due to the stabilization of higher-lying 2P-active states, which are dominated by the excitations involving orbitals extending onto the carbonyl groups. Furthermore, calculations predicted even stronger stabilization of the 2P-allowed gerade-states in symmetric Pt octaalkoxycarbonyl-tetrabenzoporphyrins. Experiments confirmed that the 2PA cross-section of PtTBP(CO2Bu)8 near 810 nm reaches above 500 GM in spite of its completely centrosymmetric structure. Combined with exceptionally bright phosphorescence (\xcf\x95phos = 0.45), strong 2PA makes Pt(II) complexes of \xcf\x80-extended porphyrins a valuable class of chromophores for 2P applications. Another important advantage of these porphyrinoids is their compact size and easily scalable synthesis."
"Phosphorodiamidate morpholinos (PMOs) and PMO\xe2\x80\x93DNA chimeras have been prepared on DNA synthesizers using phosphoramidite chemistry. This was possible by first generating boranephosphoroamidate morpholino internucleotide linkages followed by oxidative substitution with four different amines: N,N-dimethylamine, N-methylamine, ammonia, and morpholine. When compared to a natural DNA duplex, the amino modified PMO was found to have a higher melting temperature with either complementary DNA or RNA, whereas the remaining PMO analogues having morpholino, dimethylamino, or N-methylamino phosphorodiamidate linkages had melting temperatures that were either comparable or reduced. Additionally the N,N-dimethylamino PMO\xe2\x80\x93DNA chimeras were found to stimulate RNaseH1 activity. Treatment of HeLa cells with fluorescently labeled PMO chimeras demonstrated that these analogues were efficiently taken up by cells in the presence of a lipid transfection reagent. Because of the simplistic synthesis procedures, various PMO analogues are now readily available and should therefore open new pathways for research into the antisense, diagnostic, and nanotechnology oligonucleotide fields."
"Chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 (CIGS) semiconductors are potential candidates for use in photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation due to their excellent optical absorption properties and high conduction band edge position. In the present research, CIGS thin film was successfully prepared on a transparent substrate (F:SnO2 glass) using a solution-based process and applied for a photocathode in solar water splitting, which shows control of the surface state associated with sulfurization/selenization process significantly influences on the PEC activity. A ZnS passivation surface layer was introduced, which effectively suppresses charge recombination by surface states of CIGS. The CIGS/ZnS/Pt photocathode exhibited highly enhanced PEC activity (\xe2\x88\xbc24 mA\xc2\xb7cm\xe2\x80\x932 at \xe2\x88\x920.3 V vs RHE). The performances of our CIGS photocathode on the transparent substrate were also characterized under front/back light illumination, and the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) drastically changed depending on the illumination directions showing decreased IPCE especially under UV region with back illumination. The slow minority carrier (electron) transportation is suggested as a limiting factor for the PEC activity of the CIGS photocathode."
"The rational and predictable enhancement of protein stability is an important goal in protein design. Most efforts target the folded state, however stability is the free energy difference between the folded and unfolded states thus both are suitable targets. Strategies directed at the unfolded state usually seek to decrease chain entropy by introducing cross-links or by replacing glycines. Cross-linking has led to mixed results. Replacement of glycine with an l-amino acid, while reducing the entropy of the unfolded state, can introduce unfavorable steric interactions in the folded state, since glycine is often found in conformations that require a positive \xcf\x86 angle such as helical C-capping motifs or type I\xe2\x80\xb2 and II\xe2\x80\xb3 \xce\xb2-turns. l-Amino acids are strongly disfavored in these conformations, but d-amino acids are not. However, there are few reported examples and conflicting results have been obtained when glycines are replaced with d-Ala. We critically examine the effect of Gly-to-d-Ala substitutions on protein stability using experimental approaches together with molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. The data, together with a survey of high resolution structures, show that the vast majority of proteins can be stabilized by substitution of C-capping glycines with d-Ala. Sites suitable for substitutions can be identified via sequence alignment with a high degree of success. Steric clashes in the native state due to the new side chain are rarely observed, but are likely responsible for the destabilizing or null effect observed for the small subset of Gly-to-d-Ala substitutions which are not stabilizing. Changes in backbone solvation play less of a role. Favorable candidates for d-Ala substitution can be identified using a rapid algorithm based on molecular mechanics."
"Microcin C and related antibiotics are Trojan-horse peptide-adenylates. The peptide part is responsible for facilitated transport inside the sensitive cell, where it gets processed to release a toxic warhead\xe2\x80\x94a nonhydrolyzable aspartyl-adenylate, which inhibits aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. Adenylation of peptide precursors is carried out by MccB THIF-type NAD/FAD adenylyltransferases. Here, we describe a novel microcin C-like compound from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The B.\xc2\xa0amyloliquefaciens MccB demonstrates an unprecedented ability to attach a terminal cytidine monophosphate to cognate precursor peptide in cellular and cell free systems. The cytosine moiety undergoes an additional modification\xe2\x80\x94carboxymethylation\xe2\x80\x94that is carried out by the C-terminal domain of MccB and the MccS enzyme that produces carboxy-SAM, which serves as a donor of the carboxymethyl group. We show that microcin C-like compounds carrying terminal cytosines are biologically active and target aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, and that the carboxymethyl group prevents resistance that can occur due to modification of the warhead. The results expand the repertoire of known enzymatic modifications of peptides that can be used to obtain new biological activities while avoiding or limiting bacterial resistance."
"A new and highly regioselective direct C\xe2\x80\x93H arylation polymerization (DARP) methodology enables the reproducible and sustainable synthesis of high-performance \xcf\x80-conjugated photovoltaic copolymers. Unlike traditional Stille polycondensation methods for producing photovoltaic copolymers, this DARP protocol eliminates the need for environmentally harmful, toxic organotin compounds. This DARP protocol employs low loadings of commercially available catalyst components, Pd2(dba)3\xc2\xb7CHCl3 (0.5 mol%) and P(2-MeOPh)3 (2 mol%), sterically tuned carboxylic acid additives, and an environmentally friendly solvent, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. Using this DARP protocol, several representative copolymers are synthesized in excellent yields and high molecular masses. The DARP-derived copolymers are benchmarked versus Stille-derived counterparts by close comparison of optical, NMR spectroscopic, and electrochemical properties, all of which indicate great chemical similarity and no significant detectable structural defects in the DARP copolymers. The DARP- and Stille-derived copolymer and fullerene blend microstructural properties and morphologies are characterized with AFM, TEM, and XRD and are found to be virtually indistinguishable. Likewise, the charge generation, recombination, and transport characteristics of the fullerene blend films are found to be identical. For the first time, polymer solar cells fabricated using DARP-derived copolymers exhibit solar cell performances rivalling or exceeding those achieved with Stille-derived materials. For the DARP copolymer PBDTT-FTTE, the power conversion efficiency of 8.4% is a record for a DARP copolymer."
"Morphology is critical component to achieve high device performance hybrid perovskite solar cells. Here, we develop a vapor induced intermediate phase (VIP) strategy to manipulate the morphology of perovskite films. By exposing the perovskite precursor films to different saturated solvent vapor atmospheres, e.g., dimethylformamide and dimethylsufoxide, dramatic film morphological evolution occurs, associated with the formation of different intermediate phases. We observe that the crystallization kinetics is significantly altered due to the formation of these intermediate phases, yielding highly crystalline perovskite films with less defect states and high carrier lifetimes. The perovskite solar cells with the reconstructed films exhibits the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 19.2% under 1 sun AM 1.5G irradiance, which is among the highest planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. Also, the perovskite solar cells with VIP processing shows less hysteresis behavior and a stabilized power output over 18%. Our work opens up a new direction for morphology control through intermediate phase formation, and paves the way toward further enhancing the device performances of perovskite solar cells."
"In conventional semiconductor solar cells, carriers are extracted at the band edges and the excess electronic energy (E*) is lost as heat. If E* is harvested, power conversion efficiency can be as high as twice the Shockley\xe2\x80\x93Queisser limit. To date, materials suitable for hot carrier solar cells have not been found due to efficient electron/optical-phonon scattering in most semiconductors, but our recent experiments revealed long-lived hot carriers in single-crystal hybrid lead bromide perovskites. Here we turn to polycrystalline methylammonium lead iodide perovskite, which has emerged as the material for highly efficient solar cells. We observe energetic electrons with excess energy \xe2\x9f\xa8E*\xe2\x9f\xa9 \xe2\x89\x88 0.25 eV above the conduction band minimum and with lifetime as long as \xe2\x88\xbc100 ps, which is 2\xe2\x80\x933 orders of magnitude longer than those in conventional semiconductors. The energetic carriers also give rise to hot fluorescence emission with pseudo-electronic temperatures as high as 1900 K. These findings point to a suppression of hot carrier scattering with optical phonons in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite. We address mechanistic origins of this suppression and, in particular, the correlation of this suppression with dynamic disorder. We discuss potential harvesting of energetic carriers for solar energy conversion."
"Single-molecular spectroscopy reveals that photoluminescence (PL) of a single quantum dot blinks, randomly switching between bright and dim/dark states under constant photoexcitation, and quantum dots photobleach readily. These facts cast great doubts on potential applications of these promising emitters. After \xe2\x88\xbc20 years of efforts, synthesis of nonblinking quantum dots is still challenging, with nonblinking quantum dots only available in red-emitting window. Here we report synthesis of nonblinking quantum dots covering most part of the visible window using a new synthetic strategy, i.e., confining the excited-state wave functions of the core/shell quantum dots within the core quantum dot and its inner shells (\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\xaf\xe2\x88\xbc5 monolayers). For the red-emitting ones, the new synthetic strategy yields nonblinking quantum dots with small sizes (\xe2\x88\xbc8 nm in diameter) and improved nonblinking properties. These new nonblinking quantum dots are found to be antibleaching. Results further imply that the PL blinking and photobleaching of quantum dots are likely related to each other."
"A new class of small gold nanoclusters with molecular characteristics has been constructed using 1,1\xe2\x80\xb2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) as the stabilizing ligand. The identities of the small gold nanoclusters have been fully characterized by NMR, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Octa- and undecagold clusters are found to display different UV\xe2\x80\x93vis absorption behavior. The ligation of the bidentate ligands and halides or pseudohalides has resulted in the symmetry breaking of these nanoclusters with C1 symmetry. The small gold nanoclusters with different coordinating halides or pseudohalides show distinct reactivities and stabilities in ligand/anion exchange experiments. The current research has provided insights into the origin of chirality in the diphosphine-stabilized small gold nanoclusters."
"We report the encapsulation of platinum species in highly siliceous chabazite (CHA) crystallized in the presence of N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantammonium and a thiol-stabilized Pt complex. When compared to Pt/SiO2 or Pt-containing Al-rich zeolites, the materials in this work show enhanced stability toward metal sintering in a variety of industrial conditions, including H2, O2, and H2O. Remarkably, temperatures in the range 650\xe2\x80\x93750 \xc2\xb0C can be reached without significant sintering of the noble metal. Detailed structural determinations by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrate subtle control of the supported metal structures from \xe2\x88\xbc1 nm nanoparticles to site-isolated single Pt atoms via reversible interconversion of one species into another in reducing and oxidizing atmospheres. The combined used of microscopy and spectroscopy is critical to understand these surface-mediated transformations. When tested in hydrogenation reactions, Pt/CHA converts ethylene (\xe2\x88\xbc80%) but not propylene under identical conditions, in contrast to Pt/SiO2, which converts both at similar rates. These differences are attributed to the negligible diffusivity of propylene through the small-pore zeolite and provide final evidence of the metal encapsulation."
"Spin-crossover (SCO) is generally regarded as a spectacular molecular magnetism in 3d4\xe2\x80\x933d7 metal complexes and holds great promise for various applications such as memory, displays, and sensors. In particular, SCO materials can be multifunctional when a classical light- or temperature-induced SCO occurs along with other cooperative structural and/or electrical transport alterations. However, such a cooperative SCO has rarely been observed in condensed matter under hydrostatic pressure (an alternative external stimulus to light or temperature), probably due to the lack of synergy between metal neighbors under compression. Here, we report the observation of a pressure-driven, cooperative SCO in the two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb antiferromagnets MnPS3 and MnPSe3 at room temperature. Applying pressure to this confined 2D system leads to a dramatic magnetic moment collapse of Mn2+ (d5) from S = 5/2 to S = 1/2. Significantly, a number of collective phenomena were observed along with the SCO, including a large lattice collapse (\xe2\x88\xbc20% in volume), the formation of metallic bonding, and a semiconductor-to-metal transition. Experimental evidence shows that all of these events occur in the honeycomb lattice, indicating a strongly cooperative mechanism that facilitates the occurrence of the abrupt pressure-driven SCO. We believe that the observation of this cooperative pressure-driven SCO in a 2D system can provide a rare model for theoretical investigations and lead to the discovery of more pressure-responsive multifunctional materials."
"We report the development of a new class of phosphorescent zwitterionic bis(heteroleptic) Ir(III) compounds containing pyridyl ligands with weakly coordinating nido-carboranyl substituents. Treatment of phenylpyridine-based Ir(III) precursors with C-substituted ortho-carboranylpyridines in 2-ethoxyethanol results in a facile carborane deboronation and the formation of robust and highly luminescent metal complexes. The resulting nido-carboranyl fragments associate with the cationic Ir(III) center through primarily electrostatic interactions. These compounds phosphoresce at blue wavelengths (450\xe2\x80\x93470 nm) both in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix and in solution at 77 K. These complexes display structural stability at temperatures beyond 300 \xc2\xb0C and quantum yields greater than 40%. Importantly, the observed quantum yields correspond to a dramatic 10-fold enhancement over the previously reported Ir(III) congeners featuring carboranyl-containing ligands in which the boron cluster is covalently attached to the metal. Ultimately, this work suggests that the use of a ligand framework containing a weakly coordinating anionic component can provide a new avenue for designing efficient Ir(III)-based phosphorescent emitters."
"Precise control over the topology of plasmonic metal\xe2\x80\x93semiconductor heteronanostructures is essential for fully harnessing their plasmonic function and hence for designing innovative solar energy conversion platforms. Here, we present a rational synthesis strategy for the realization of plasmonic metal\xe2\x80\x93semiconductor heteronanocrystals with intended configurations through the site-selective overgrowth of semiconductor Cu2O on desired sites of anisotropic Au nanocrystals. Both the exploitation of structural characteristics of Au nanocrystals and the selective stabilization of their surfaces are keys to the construction of heteronanocrystals with a specific configuration. Our approach can provide an opportunity to precisely explore the link between the solar energy conversion efficiency and the structure of heteronanocrystals as well as to obtain important insights into the underpinning mechanism. Heteronanocrystals produced by Cu2O overgrowth preferentially on the multiple high-curvature sites of Au nanocrystals exhibited prominent photocatalytic hydrogen production activity due to efficient charge separation by strong plasmon excitation at the Au\xe2\x80\x93Cu2O interface and subsequent sustainable hot electron transfer from Au to Cu2O."
"Molybdenum complexes with the general formula Mo(NR)(CHR\xe2\x80\xb2)(OR\xe2\x80\xb3)(Cl)(MeCN) (R = t-Bu or 1-adamantyl; OR\xe2\x80\xb3 = a 2,6-terphenoxide) recently have been found to be highly active catalysts for cross-metathesis reactions between Z-internal olefins and Z-1,2-dichloroethylene or Z-(CF3)CH\xe2\x95\x90CH(CF3). In this paper we report methods of synthesizing new potential catalysts with the general formula M(NR)(CHR\xe2\x80\xb2)(OR\xe2\x80\xb3)(Cl)(L) in which M = Mo or W, NR = N-2,6-diisopropylphenyl or NC6F5, and L is a phosphine, a pyridine, or a nitrile. We also test and compare all catalysts in the cross-metathesis of Z-1,2-dichloroethylene and cyclooctene. Our investigations indicate that tungsten complexes are inactive in the test reaction either because the donor is bound too strongly or because acetonitrile inserts into a W\xe2\x95\x90C bond. The acetonitrile or pivalonitrile Mo(NR)(CHR\xe2\x80\xb2)(OR\xe2\x80\xb3)(Cl)(L) complexes are found to be especially reactive because the 14e Mo(NR)(CHR\xe2\x80\xb2)(OR\xe2\x80\xb3)Cl core is accessible through dissociation of the nitrile to a significant extent. Pivalonitrile can be removed (>95%) from Mo(NAr)(CHCMe2Ph)(OHMT)(Cl)(t-BuCN) (Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl; OHMT = 2,6-dimesitylphenoxide) to give 14e Mo(NAr)(CHCMe2Ph)(OHMT)Cl in solution as a mixture of syn and anti (60:40 at 0.015 M) nitrile-free isomers, but these 14e complexes have not yet been isolated in pure form. The syn isomer of Mo(NAr)(CHCMe2Ph)(OHMT)Cl binds pivalonitrile most strongly. Other Mo(NR)(CHR\xe2\x80\xb2)(OR\xe2\x80\xb3)(Cl)(L) complexes can be activated through addition of B(C6F5)3. High stereoselectivities (>98% Z,Z) of ClCH\xe2\x95\x90CH(CH2)6CH\xe2\x95\x90CHCl are not restricted to tert-butylimido or adamantylimido complexes; 96.2% Z selectivity is observed with boron-activated Mo(NC6F5)(CHR\xe2\x80\xb2)(OHIPT)(Cl)(PPhMe2). So far no Mo\xe2\x95\x90CHCl complexes, which are required intermediates in the test reaction, have been observed in NMR studies at room temperature."
"Molecular ferroelectrics are attracting much attention as valuable complements to conventional ceramic ferroelectrics owing to their solution processability and nontoxicity. Encouragingly, the recent discovery of a multiaxial molecular ferroelectric, tetraethylammonium perchlorate, is expected to be able to solve the problem that in the technologically relevant thin-film form uniaxial molecular ferroelectrics have been found to perform considerably more poorly than in bulk. However, it can show good polarization\xe2\x80\x93electric field (P\xe2\x80\x93E) hysteresis loops only at very low frequency, severely hampering practical applications such as ferroelectric random access memory. Here, we present a biaxial molecular ferroelectric thin film of [Hdabco]ClO4 (dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) (1), where a perfect ferroelectric hysteresis loop can be observed even at 10 kHz. It is the first example of a molecular ferroelectric thin film whose polarization can be switched at such a high frequency. Moreover, using piezoresponse force microscopy, we clearly observed the coexistence of 180\xc2\xb0 and non-180\xc2\xb0 ferroelectric domains and provided direct experimental proof that 180\xc2\xb0 ferroelectric switching and non-180\xc2\xb0 ferroelastic switching are both realized; that is, a flexible alteration of the polarization axis direction can occur in the thin film by applying an electric field. These results open a new avenue for applications of molecular ferroelectrics and will inspire further exploration of high-performance multiaxial molecular ferroelectric thin films."
"The combination of two or more reactive centers working in concert on a substrate to facilitate the reaction is now considered state of the art in catalysis, yet there still remains a tremendous challenge. Few heterogeneous systems of this sort have been exploited, as the active sites spatially separated within the rigid framework are usually difficult to cooperate. It is now shown that this roadblock can be surpassed. The underlying principle of the strategy presented here is the integration of catalytic components with excellent flexibility and porous heterogeneous catalysts, as demonstrated by the placement of linear ionic polymers in close proximity to surface Lewis acid active sites anchored on the walls of a covalent organic framework (COF). Using the cycloaddition of the epoxides and CO2 as a model reaction, dramatic activity improvements have been achieved for the composite catalysts in relation to the individual catalytic component. Furthermore, they also clearly outperform the benchmark catalytic systems formed by the combination of the molecular organocatalysts and heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysts, while affording additional recyclability. The extraordinary flexibility and enriched concentration of the catalytically active moieties on linear polymers facilitate the concerted catalysis, thus leading to superior catalytic performance. This work therefore uncovers an entirely new strategy for designing bifunctional catalysts with double-activation behavior and opens a new avenue in the design of multicapable systems that mimic biocatalysis."
A computational study shows that the mechanism behind an important photodimerization reaction in DNA occurs in the singlet state.
"The expanding \xe2\x80\x9ctoolbox\xe2\x80\x9d of biocatalysts opens new opportunities to redesign synthetic strategies to target molecules by incorporating a key enzymatic step into the synthesis. Herein, we describe a general biocatalytic approach for the enantioselective preparation of 2,6-disubstituted piperidines starting from easily accessible pro-chiral ketoenones. The strategy represents a new biocatalytic disconnection, which relies on an \xcf\x89-TA-mediated aza-Michael reaction. Significantly, we show that the reversible enzymatic process can power the shuttling of amine functionality across a molecular framework, providing access to the desired aza-Michael products."
"Water\xe2\x80\x93protein chemical exchange in membrane-bound proteins is an important parameter for understanding how proteins interact with their aqueous environment, but has been difficult to observe in membrane-bound biological systems. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of probing specific water\xe2\x80\x93protein chemical exchange in membrane-bound proteins in solid-state MAS NMR. By spin-locking the 1H magnetization along the magic angle, the 1H spin diffusion is suppressed such that a water\xe2\x80\x93protein chemical exchange process can be monitored indirectly by dipolar-dephased 15N signals through polarization transfer from 1H. In the example of the Influenza A full length M2 protein, the buildup of dipolar-dephased 15N signals from the tetrad of His37 side chains have been observed as a function of spin-lock time. This confirms that hydronium ions are in exchange with protons in the His37 NH bonds at the heart of the M2 proton conduction mechanism, with an exchange rate constant of \xe2\x88\xbc1750 s\xe2\x80\x931 for pH 6.2 at \xe2\x88\x9210 \xc2\xb0C."
"We describe a metal-free, photocatalytic hydrodefluorination (HDF) of polyfluoroarenes (FA) using pyrene-based photocatalysts (Py). The weak \xe2\x80\x9c\xcf\x80-hole\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x9d interaction between Py and FA promotes the electron transfer against unfavorable energetics (\xce\x94GET up to 0.63 eV) and initiates the subsequent HDF. The steric hindrance of Py and FA largely dictates the HDF reaction rate, pointing to an inner-sphere electron transfer pathway. This work highlights the importance of the size and shape of the photocatalyst and the substrate in controlling the electron transfer mechanism and rates as well as the overall photocatalytic processes."
"The continuous, real-time monitoring of specific molecular targets in unprocessed clinical samples would enable many transformative medical applications. Electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors appear to be a promising approach to this end because of their selectivity (performance in complex samples, such as serum) and reversible, single-step operation. E-AB sensors suffer, however, from often-severe baseline drift when challenged in undiluted whole blood. In response we report here a dual-reporter approach to performing E-AB baseline drift correction. The approach incorporates two redox reporters on the aptamer, one of which serves as the target-responsive sensor and the other, which reports at a distinct, nonoverlapping redox potential, serving as a drift-correcting reference. Taking the difference in their relative signals largely eliminates the drift observed for these sensors in flowing, undiluted whole blood, reducing drift of up to 50% to less than 2% over many hours of continuous operation under these challenging conditions."
"Dysregulated metabolism is a hallmark of many diseases, including cancer. Methods to fluorescently detect metabolites have the potential to enable new approaches to cancer detection and imaging. However, fluorescent sensing methods for naturally occurring cellular metabolites are relatively unexplored. Here we report the development of a chemical approach to detect the oncometabolite fumarate. Our strategy exploits a known bioorthogonal reaction, the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of nitrileimines and electron-poor olefins, to detect fumarate via fluorescent pyrazoline cycloadduct formation. We demonstrate hydrazonyl chlorides serve as readily accessible nitrileimine precursors, whose reactivity and spectral properties can be tuned to enable detection of fumarate and other dipolarophile metabolites. Finally, we show this reaction can be used to detect enzyme activity changes caused by mutations in fumarate hydratase, which underlie the familial cancer predisposition syndrome hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. Our studies define a novel intersection of bioorthogonal chemistry and metabolite reactivity that may be harnessed to enable biological profiling, imaging, and diagnostic applications."
"The first direct catalytic asymmetric synthesis of \xce\xb3-amino ketones was realized by the development of a highly diastereoselective and enantioselective C\xe2\x80\x93C bond-forming umpolung reaction of imines and enones under the catalysis of a new cinchona alkaloid-derived phase-transfer catalyst. In a loading ranging from 0.02 to 2.5 mol %, the catalyst activates a broad range of trifluoromethyl imines and aldimines as nucleophiles to engage in chemo-, regio-, diastereo- and enantioselective C\xe2\x80\x93C bond-forming reactions with acyclic and cyclic enones, thereby converting these readily available prochiral starting materials into highly enantiomerically enriched chiral \xce\xb3-amino ketones in synthetically useful yields. Enabled by this unprecedented umpolung reaction of imines, conceptually new and concise routes were developed for the asymmetric synthesis of nitrogen-heterocycles such as pyrrolidines and indolizidines."
"Compositional engineering of a mixed cation/mixed halide perovskite in the form of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 is one of the most effective strategies to obtain record-efficiency perovskite solar cells. However, the perovskite self-organization upon crystallization and the final elemental distribution, which are paramount for device optimization, are still poorly understood. Here we map the nanoscale charge carrier and elemental distribution of mixed perovskite films yielding 20% efficient devices. Combining a novel in-house-developed high-resolution helium ion microscope coupled with a secondary ion mass spectrometer (HIM-SIMS) with Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), we demonstrate that part of the mixed perovskite film intrinsically segregates into iodide-rich perovskite nanodomains on a length scale of up to a few hundred nanometers. Thus, the homogeneity of the film is disrupted, leading to a variation in the optical properties at the micrometer scale. Our results provide unprecedented understanding of the nanoscale perovskite composition."
"High-energy rechargeable Li metal batteries are hindered by dendrite growth due to the use of a liquid electrolyte. Solid polymer electrolytes, as promising candidates to solve the above issue, are expected to own high Li ion conductivity without sacrificing mechanical strength, which is still a big challenge to realize. In this study, a bifunctional solid polymer electrolyte exactly having these two merits is proposed with an interpenetrating network of poly(ether\xe2\x80\x93acrylate) (ipn-PEA) and realized via photopolymerization of ion-conductive poly(ethylene oxide) and branched acrylate. The ipn-PEA electrolyte with facile processing capability integrates high mechanical strength (ca. 12 GPa) with high room-temperature ionic conductance (0.22 mS cm\xe2\x80\x931), and significantly promotes uniform Li plating/stripping. Li metal full cells assembled with ipn-PEA electrolyte and cathodes within 4.5 V vs Li+/Li operate effectively at a rate of 5 C and cycle stably at a rate of 1 C at room temperature. Because of its fabrication simplicity and compelling characteristics, the bifunctional ipn-PEA electrolyte reshapes the feasibility of room-temperature solid-state Li metal batteries."
"The research field on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is seeing frequent record breaking in the power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, organic\xe2\x80\x93inorganic hybrid halide perovskites and organic additives in common hole-transport materials (HTMs) exhibit poor stability against moisture and heat. Here we report the successful fabrication of all-inorganic PSCs without any labile or expensive organic components. The entire fabrication process can be operated in ambient environment without humidity control (e.g., a glovebox). Even without encapsulation, the all-inorganic PSCs present no performance degradation in humid air (90\xe2\x80\x9395% relative humidity, 25 \xc2\xb0C) for over 3 months (2640 h) and can endure extreme temperatures (100 and \xe2\x88\x9222 \xc2\xb0C). Moreover, by elimination of expensive HTMs and noble-metal electrodes, the cost was significantly reduced. The highest PCE of the first-generation all-inorganic PSCs reached 6.7%. This study opens the door for next-generation PSCs with long-term stability under harsh conditions, making practical application of PSCs a real possibility."
"Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) can generate a ruthenium\xe2\x80\x93hydride intermediate that catalyzes the reduction of O2 to H2O2, which endows it with potent anticancer properties. A catalyst that could access a Ru\xe2\x80\x93H intermediate using oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as the H\xe2\x80\x93 source, however, could draw upon a supply of reducing equivalents 1000-fold more abundant than NADH, which would enable significantly greater H2O2 production. Herein, it is demonstrated, using the reduction of ABTS\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x93 to ABTS2\xe2\x80\x93, that NAD+ can function as a reductant. Mechanistic evidence is presented that suggests a Ru\xe2\x80\x93H intermediate is formed via \xce\xb2-hydride elimination from a ribose subunit in NAD+. The insight gained from the heretofore unknown ability of NAD+ to function as a reductant and H\xe2\x80\x93 donor may lead to undiscovered biological carbohydrate oxidation pathways and new chemotherapeutic strategies."
The trans-decalin structure formed by intramolecular Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder cycloaddition is widely present among bioactive natural products isolated from fungi. We elucidated the concise three-enzyme biosynthetic pathway of the cytotoxic myceliothermophin and biochemically characterized the Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alderase that catalyzes the formation of trans-decalin from an acyclic substrate. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism rationalize both the substrate and stereoselectivity of the enzyme.
"Electrophilic small molecules are an important class of chemical probes and drugs that produce biological effects by irreversibly modifying proteins. Examples of electrophilic drugs include covalent kinase inhibitors that are used to treat cancer and the multiple sclerosis drug dimethyl fumarate. Optimized covalent drugs typically inactivate their protein targets rapidly in cells, but ensuing time-dependent, off-target protein modification can erode selectivity and diminish the utility of reactive small molecules as chemical probes and therapeutics. Here, we describe an approach to confer kinetic selectivity to electrophilic drugs. We show that an analogue of the covalent Bruton\xe2\x80\x99s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor Ibrutinib bearing a fumarate ester electrophile is vulnerable to enzymatic metabolism on a time-scale that preserves rapid and sustained BTK inhibition, while thwarting more slowly accumulating off-target reactivity in cell and animal models. These findings demonstrate that metabolically labile electrophilic groups can endow covalent drugs with kinetic selectivity to enable perturbation of proteins and biochemical pathways with greater precision."
"Ladderane lipids produced by anammox bacteria constitute some of the most structurally fascinating yet poorly studied molecules among biological membrane lipids. Slow growth of the producing organism and the inherent difficulty of purifying complex lipid mixtures have prohibited isolation of useful amounts of natural ladderane lipids. We have devised a highly selective total synthesis of ladderane lipid tails and a full phosphatidylcholine to enable biophysical studies on chemically homogeneous samples of these molecules. Additionally, we report the first proof of absolute configuration of a natural ladderane."
"In artificial molecular devices, flexible, linear chains typically exhibit very weak capability in inhibiting molecular motion. Herein, we describe the dynamic properties of a series of molecular turnstiles consisting of a rigid frame and a phenyl rotator flanked with linear alkoxymethyl substituents. The long, flexible substituents act as elastic baffles to inhibit the rotations of the rotator at medium to fast speeds on the NMR time scale. When the rotator moves slowly, the substituents become more relaxed, thus obtaining an opportunity to completely thread through the cavity of the turnstiles. These findings reveal a basic but missing correlation between steric hindrance and speed of motion for flexible, linear chains in dynamic molecular devices, thus opening up a new direction toward molecular machines with more elaborate dynamic functions."
"Two-dimensional (2D) metal carbides and nitrides, called MXenes, have attracted great interest for applications such as energy storage. We demonstrate their potential as Schottky-barrier-free metal contacts to 2D semiconductors, providing a solution to the contact-resistance problem in 2D electronics. On the basis of first-principles calculations, we find that the surface chemistry strongly affects Fermi level of MXenes: O termination always increases the work function with respect to that of bare surface, OH always decreases it, whereas F exhibits either trend depending on the specific material. This phenomenon originates from the effect of surface dipoles, which together with the weak Fermi level pinning, enable Schottky-barrier-free hole (or electron) injection into 2D semiconductors through van der Waals junctions with some of the O-terminated (or all the OH-terminated) MXenes. Furthermore, we suggest synthetic routes to control surface terminations based on calculated formation energies. This study enhances understanding of the correlation between surface chemistry and electronic/transport properties of 2D materials, and also gives predictions for improving 2D electronics."
"Photocatalytic enantioselective epoxidation of terminal olefins using a mononuclear non-heme chiral manganese catalyst, [(R,R-BQCN)MnII]2+, and water as an oxygen source yields epoxides with relatively high enantioselectivities (e.g., up to 60% enantiomeric excess). A synthetic mononuclear non-heme chiral Mn(IV)\xe2\x80\x93oxo complex, [(R,R-BQCN)MnIV(O)]2+, affords similar enantioselectivities in the epoxidation of terminal olefins under stoichiometric reaction conditions. Mechanistic details of each individual step of the photoinduced catalysis, including formation of the Mn(IV)\xe2\x80\x93oxo intermediate, are discussed on the basis of combined results of laser flash photolysis and other spectroscopic methods."
We introduce a new biochemically responsive Mn-based MRI contrast agent that provides a 9-fold change in relaxivity via switching between the Mn3+ and Mn2+ oxidation states. Interchange between oxidation states is promoted by a \xe2\x80\x9cJanus\xe2\x80\x9d ligand that isomerizes between binding modes that favor Mn3+ or Mn2+. It is the only ligand that supports stable complexes of Mn3+ and Mn2+ in biological milieu. Rapid interconversion between oxidation states is mediated by peroxidase activity (oxidation) and l-cysteine (reduction). This Janus system provides a new paradigm for the design of biochemically responsive MRI contrast agents.
"The reaction of 3 equiv of Li\xe2\x80\x93C6H3-2,6-(C6H4-4-tBu)2 (Terph\xe2\x80\x93Li) with UI3(1,4-dioxane)1.5 led to the formation of the homoleptic uranium(III) tris(aryl) complex (Terph)3U (1). The U\xe2\x80\x93C bonds are reactive: treatment with excess iPrN\xe2\x95\x90C\xe2\x95\x90NiPr yielded the double-insertion product [TerphC(NiPr)2]2U(Terph) (2). Complexes 1 and 2 were characterized by X-ray crystallography, which showed that the U\xe2\x80\x93C bond length in 2 (2.624(4) \xc3\x85) is \xe2\x88\xbc0.1 \xc3\x85 longer than the average U\xe2\x80\x93C bond length in 1 (2.522(2) \xc3\x85). Thermal decomposition of 1 yielded Terph\xe2\x80\x93H as the only identifiable product; the process is unimolecular with activation parameters \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 21.5 \xc2\xb1 0.3 kcal/mol and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x927.5 \xc2\xb1 0.8 cal\xc2\xb7mol\xe2\x80\x931 K\xe2\x80\x931, consistent with intramolecular proton abstraction. The protonolysis chemistry of 1 was also explored, which led to the uranium(IV) alkoxide complex U(OCPh3)4(DME) (3\xc2\xb7DME)."
"Herein we present a novel strategy based on palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation by taking advantage of the nucleophilic addition of external fluoride onto gem-difluoroalkenes as the initiation step. The merit of this protocol is highly appealing, as it enables a formal allylation of trifluoroethylarene derivatives through the in situ generation of \xce\xb2-trifluorocarbanions, which otherwise are deemed to be problematic in deprotonative allylation. Furthermore, this strategy distinguishes itself by high modularity, operational simplicity, and wide substrate scope with respect to allyl carbonates, giving rise to a broad array of homoallyltrifluoromethane derivatives, which otherwise would not be easily obtained using existing synthetic methods."
"We report the synthesis and reactivity of unusual T-shaped (LXL)Au(I)-pincer complexes, based on a carbazole framework flanked by two mesoionic carbenes (MICs). In contrast to other Au(I) complexes, these complexes react with electrophiles. Protonation and alkylation occur either at the metal or the ligand, depending on steric factors. Of particular interest, protonation at gold leads to an unprecedented cationic Au(III) hydride, which gives a 1H NMR resonance at \xce\xb4 \xe2\x88\x928.34 ppm. The reactivity of this \xe2\x80\x9chydride\xe2\x80\x9d, however, shows protic and not hydridic behavior."
"Enantioselective 1,1-diarylation of terminal alkenes enabled by the combination of Pd catalysis with a chiral anion phase transfer (CAPT) strategy is reported herein. The reaction of substituted benzyl acrylates with aryldiazonium salts and arylboronic acids gave the corresponding 3,3-diarylpropanoates in moderate to good yields with high enantioselectivies (up to 98:2 er). Substituents on the benzyl acrylate and CAPT catalyst significantly affect the enantioselectivity, and multidimensional parametrization identified correlations suggesting structural origins for the high stereocontrol."
"An enantioselective intermolecular coupling of oxygen nucleophiles and allylic alcohols to give \xce\xb2-aryloxycarbonyl compounds is disclosed using a chiral pyridine oxazoline-ligated palladium catalyst under mild conditions. As opposed to the formation of traditional Wacker-type products, enantioselective migratory insertion is followed by \xce\xb2-hydride elimination toward the adjacent alcohol. Deuterium labeling experiments suggest a syn-migratory insertion of the alkene into the Pd\xe2\x80\x93O bond. A broad scope of phenols, various allylic alcohols, and an alkyl hydroperoxide are viable coupling partners in this process."
"(Phosphino)phosphaketenes (>P\xe2\x80\x94P\xe2\x95\x90C\xe2\x95\x90O) behave as (phosphino)phosphinidene-carbonyl adducts (>P\xe2\x80\x94P\xe2\x86\x90:C\xe2\x95\x90O). CO scrambling was observed using 13C labeled CO, and exchange reactions with phosphines afford the corresponding (phosphino)phosphinidene\xe2\x80\x93phosphine adducts (>P\xe2\x80\x94P\xe2\x86\x90:PR3). The latter react with isonitriles and singlet carbenes giving (phosphino)phosphinidene\xe2\x80\x93isonitrile (>P\xe2\x80\x94P\xe2\x86\x90:CNR) and \xe2\x88\x92carbene adducts (>P\xe2\x80\x94P\xe2\x86\x90:C<). Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, it is shown that these \xe2\x80\x9cligand\xe2\x80\x9d exchange reactions occur via an associative mechanism as classically observed with transition metal complexes."
"We provide herein a mechanistic analysis of aryl sulfoxide excited state processes, inspired by our recent report of aryl sulfoxide based fluorescent chemosensors. The use of aryl sulfoxides as reporting elements in chemosensor development is a significant deviation from previous approaches, and thus warrants closer examination. We demonstrate that metal ion binding suppresses nonradiative excited state decay by blocking formation of a previously unrecognized charge transfer excited state, leading to fluorescence enhancement. This charge transfer state derives from the initially formed locally excited state followed by intramolecular charge transfer to form a sulfoxide radical cation/aryl radical anion pair. With the aid of computational studies, we map out ground and excited state potential energy surface details for aryl sulfoxides, and conclude that fluorescence enhancement is almost entirely the result of excited state effects. This work expands previous proposals that excited state pyramidal inversion is the major nonradiative decay pathway for aryl sulfoxides. We show that pyramidal inversion is indeed relevant, but that an additional and dominant nonradiative pathway must also exist. These conclusions have implications for the design of next generation sulfoxide based fluorescent chemosensors."
"Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into organic molecules is a very complicated and important reaction. Two possible pathways, the fast-hydrogenation (FH) path and the fast-deoxygenation (FdO) path, have been proposed on the most popular photocatalyst TiO2. We have carried out first-principles calculations to investigate both pathways on the perfect and defective anatase TiO2(101) surfaces to provide comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism. For the FH path, it is found that oxygen vacancy on defective surface can greatly lower the barrier of the deoxygenation processes, which makes it a more active site than the surface Ti. For the FdO path, our calculation suggests that it can not proceed on the perfect surface, nor can it proceed on the defective surface due to their unfavorable energetics. Based on the fact that the FH path can proceed both at the surface Ti site and the oxygen vacancy site, we have proposed a simple mechanism that is compatible with various experiments. It can properly rationalize the selectivity of the reaction and greatly simplify the picture of the reaction. The important role played by oxygen vacancy in the new mechanism is highlighted and a strategy for design of more efficient photocatalysts is proposed accordingly."
"Quinones participate in diverse electron transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer processes in chemistry and biology. To understand the relationship between these redox processes, an experimental study was carried out to probe the 1\xc2\xa0e\xe2\x80\x93 and 2\xc2\xa0e\xe2\x80\x93/2\xc2\xa0H+ reduction potentials of a number of common quinones. The results reveal a non-linear correlation between the 1\xc2\xa0e\xe2\x80\x93 and 2\xc2\xa0e\xe2\x80\x93/2\xc2\xa0H+ reduction potentials. This unexpected observation prompted a computational study of 134 different quinones, probing their 1\xc2\xa0e\xe2\x80\x93 reduction potentials, pKa values, and 2\xc2\xa0e\xe2\x80\x93/2\xc2\xa0H+ reduction potentials. The density functional theory calculations reveal an approximately linear correlation between these three properties and an effective Hammett constant associated with the quinone substituent(s). However, deviations from this linear scaling relationship are evident for quinones that feature intramolecular hydrogen bonding, halogen substituents, charged substituents, and/or sterically bulky substituents. These results, particularly the different substituent effects on the 1\xc2\xa0e\xe2\x80\x93 versus 2\xc2\xa0e\xe2\x80\x93/2\xc2\xa0H+ reduction potentials, have important implications for designing quinones with tailored redox properties."
"The formation of cyclobutane thymine dimers is one of the most important DNA carcinogenic photolesions induced by ultraviolet irradiation. The long debated question whether thymine dimerization after direct light excitation involves singlet or triplet states is investigated here for the first time using nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the precursor of this [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction is the singlet doubly \xcf\x802\xcf\x80*2 excited state, which is spectroscopically rather dark. Excitation to the bright 1\xcf\x80\xcf\x80* or dark 1n\xcf\x80* excited states does not lead to thymine dimer formation. In all cases, intersystem crossing to the triplet states is not observed during the simulated time, indicating that ultrafast dimerization occurs in the singlet manifold. The dynamics simulations also show that dimerization takes place only when conformational control happens in the doubly excited state."
"The highly active iridium \xe2\x80\x9cblue solution\xe2\x80\x9d chemical and electrochemical water oxidation catalyst obtained from Cp*IrL(OH) precursors (L = 2-pyridyl-2-propanoate) has been difficult to characterize as no crystal structure can be obtained because of the multiplicity of geometrical isomers present. Other data suggest complete loss of the Cp* ligand and the formation of a LIr-O-IrL unit. We have now developed a route to a series of well-defined Ir(IV,IV) mono-\xce\xbc-oxo dimers, containing the closely related L2Ir-O-IrL2 unit. Unlike the catalyst, these model compounds are separable by silica gel chromatography and readily form single crystals. We report three stereoisomers with the formula ClL2Ir-O-IrL2Cl, which are fully characterized, including by X-ray crystallography, and are compared to the \xe2\x80\x9cblue solution\xe2\x80\x9d. To the best of our knowledge, these species represent the first examples of structurally characterized dinuclear \xce\xbc-oxo Ir(IV,IV) compounds without metal\xe2\x80\x93carbon bonds."
"Laser-initiated decomposition of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can lead to medical, military, and other applications. In medicine, CNTs give rise to efficient remedies against diseases and malignant cells, since they encapsulate drug molecules, can be delivered inside living organisms, and absorb light that penetrates through biological tissues. As explosives, pyrotechnics, and propellants, CNTs can be activated remotely by a visible or infrared laser, avoiding the need for a detonating cord. The reported non-equilibrium investigation demonstrates the possibility of photoinduced polynitro-CNT explosion and provides a detailed chemical mechanism of the decomposition process, explicitly in the time domain. Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (MD) performed with real-time time-dependent tight-binding density functional theory demonstrates that the photogenerated exciton deposits its energy into a broad range of phonon modes within less than a picosecond, resulting in a rapid polynitro-CNT heating. Following the heating, reactive MD demonstrates an explosion, during which the local temperature of polynitro-CNTs and its fragments rises as high as 4000 K. Photoexcitation of nitro groups by a high-energy laser is not required; the energy can be delivered to polynitro-CNTs using near-infrared light within the biological window. Furthermore, the explosion is possible both with and without an external oxygen source. Anaerobic explosion could be particularly beneficial in confined biological and nanoscale environments. The products of the polynitro-CNT decomposition are nontoxic: carbon dioxide and molecular nitrogen. The in silico demonstration of the laser-induced polynitro-CNT explosion, its chemical mechanism, and the time scales of physical and chemical transformations can be tested experimentally using time-resolved laser techniques."
"The impact of nanotechnology on analytical science is hardly overlooked. In the search for ever-increasing sensitivity in biomedical sensors, nanoparticles have been playing a unique role as, for instance, ultrabright labels, and unravelling the intimate mechanisms which govern their functioning is mandatory for the design of ultrasentitive devices. Herein, we investigated the mechanism of electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) in a family of core\xe2\x80\x93shell silica\xe2\x80\x93PEG nanoparticles (DDSNs), variously doped with a Ru(bpy)32+ triethoxysilane derivative, and displaying homogeneous morphological, hydrodynamic, and photophysical properties. ECL experiments, performed in the presence of 2-(dibutylamino)ethanol (DBAE) as coreactant, showed two parallel mechanisms of ECL generation: one mechanism (I) which involves exclusively the radicals deriving from the coreactant oxidation and a second one (II) involving also the direct anodic oxidation of the Ru(II) moieties. The latter mechanism includes electron (hole) hopping between neighboring redox centers as evidenced in our previous studies and supported by a theoretical model we have recently proposed. Quite unexpectedly, however, we found that the efficiency of the two mechanisms varies in opposite directions within the DDSNs series, with mechanism I or mechanism II prevailing at low and high doping levels, respectively. Since mechanism II has an intrinsically lower efficiency, the ECL emission intensity was also found to grow linearly with doping only at relatively low doping levels while it deviates negatively at higher ones. As the \xce\xb6-potential of DDSNs increases with the doping level from negative to slightly positive values, as a likely consequence of the accumulating cationic charge within the silica core, we attributed the observed change in the ECL generation mechanism along the DDSN series to a modulation of the electrostatic and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions between the DDSNs and the radical cationic species involved in the ECL generation. The results we report therefore show that the ECL intensity of a nanosized system cannot be merely incremented acting on doping, since other parameters come into play. We think that these results could serve as valuable indications to design more efficient ECL nano- and microsized labels for ultrasensitive bioanalysis."
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important gene regulators that bind with target genes and repress target gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The identification of target genes associated with miRNAs inside different cells is a major challenge in miRNA chemical biology due to the lack of functional miRNAs bearing appropriate tags. Here we report photoclickable miRNAs as appropriately pretagged miRNAs that keep the intracellular function of miRNAs and allow the addition of molecular handles through photoclick reaction. The photoclickable miRNAs upon transfection inside cells were able to form functional complexes with target genes and repress target gene expression. Target genes associated with the photoclickable miRNAs in the complexes were then tagged with the molecular handle through photoclick reaction for pull-down and identification. Using photoclickable miR-106a, miR-27, and miR-122, we first verified that their intracellular function was comparable to that of intact miRNAs, which showed obvious advantage over corresponding biotinylated miRNAs. After attaching the biotin handle to the associated complexes containing the photoclickable miRNAs through the tetrazole-ene photoclick reaction, target genes previously bound with these miRNAs inside cells were successfully pulled town and analyzed. The application of this strategy was demonstrated by the identification of several new target genes of miR-122, followed by revealing a novel regulatory pathway in HepG2 cells with regard to the role of PEG10 in miR-122-promoted cell apoptosis."
"By using a high-pressure reaction, we prepared a new oxynitride ZnTaO2N that crystallizes in a centrosymmetric (R3\xcc\x85c) high-temperature LiNbO3-type structure (HTLN-type). The stabilization of the HTLN-type structure down to low temperatures (at least 20 K) makes it possible to investigate not only the stability of this phase, but also the phase transition to a noncentrosymmetric (R3c) LiNbO3-type structure (LN-type) which is yet to be clarified. Synchrotron and neutron diffraction studies in combination with transmission electron microscopy show that Zn is located at a disordered 12c site instead of 6a, implying an order\xe2\x80\x93disorder mechanism of the phase transition. It is found that the closed d-shell of Zn2+, as well as the high-valent Ta5+ ion, is responsible for the stabilization of the HTLN-type structure, affording a novel quasitriangular ZnO2N coordination. Interestingly, only 3% Zn substitution for MnTaO2N induces a phase transition from LN- to HTLN-type structure, implying the proximity in energy between the two structural types, which is supported by the first-principles calculations."
"Particle/particle interfaces play a crucial role in the functionality and performance of nanocrystalline materials such as mesoporous metal oxide electrodes. Defects at these interfaces are known to impede charge separation via slow-down of transport and increase of charge recombination, but can be passivated via electrochemical doping (i.e., incorporation of electron/proton pairs), leading to transient but large enhancement of photoelectrode performance. Although this process is technologically very relevant, it is still poorly understood. Here we report on the electrochemical characterization and the theoretical modeling of electron traps in nanocrystalline rutile TiO2 films. Significant changes in the electrochemical response of porous films consisting of a random network of TiO2 particles are observed upon the electrochemical accumulation of electron/proton pairs. The reversible shift of a capacitive peak in the voltammetric profile of the electrode is assigned to an energetic modification of trap states at particle/particle interfaces. This hypothesis is supported by first-principles theoretical calculations on a TiO2 grain boundary, providing a simple model for particle/particle interfaces. In particular, it is shown how protons readily segregate to the grain boundary (being up to 0.6 eV more stable than in the TiO2 bulk), modifying its structure and electron-trapping properties. The presence of hydrogen at the grain boundary increases the average depth of traps while at the same time reducing their number compared to the undoped situation. This provides an explanation for the transient enhancement of the photoelectrocatalytic activity toward methanol photooxidation which is observed following electrochemical hydrogen doping of rutile TiO2 nanoparticle electrodes."
"Despite the huge success of enantioselective Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid catalysis, experimental data about structures and activation modes of substrate/catalyst complexes in solution are very rare. Here, for the first time, detailed insights into the structures of imine/Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid catalyst complexes are presented on the basis of NMR data and underpinned by theoretical calculations. The chiral Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid catalyst R-TRIP (3,3\xe2\x80\xb2-bis(2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl)-1,1\xe2\x80\xb2-binaphthyl-2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-diyl hydrogen phosphate) was investigated together with six aromatic imines. For each investigated system, an E-imine/R-TRIP complex and a Z-imine/R-TRIP complex were observed. Each of these complexes consists of two structures, which are in fast exchange on the NMR time scale; i.e., overall four structures were found. Both identified E-imine/R-TRIP structures feature a strong hydrogen bond but differ in the orientation of the imine relative to the catalyst. The exchange occurs by tilting the imine inside the complex and thereby switching the oxygen that constitutes the hydrogen bond. A similar situation is observed for all investigated Z-imine/R-TRIP complexes. Here, an additional exchange pathway is opened via rotation of the imine. For all investigated imine/R-TRIP complexes, the four core structures are highly preserved. Thus, these core structures are independent of electron density and substituent modulations of the aromatic imines. Overall, this study reveals that the absolute structural space of binary imine/TRIP complexes is large and the variations of the four core structures are small. The high mobility is supposed to promote reactivity, while the preservation of the core structures in conjunction with extensive \xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93\xcf\x80 and CH\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interactions leads to high enantioselectivities and tolerance of different substrates."
"The stringent distance dependence of F\xc3\xb6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) has limited the ability of an energy donor to donate excitation energy to an acceptor over a F\xc3\xb6rster critical distance (R0) of 2\xe2\x80\x936 nm. This poses a fundamental size constraint (<8 nm or \xe2\x88\xbc4R0) for experimentation requiring particle-based energy donors. Here, we describe a spatial distribution function model and theoretically validate that the particle size constraint can be mitigated through coupling FRET with a resonant energy migration process. By combining excitation energy migration and surface trapping, we demonstrate experimentally an over 600-fold enhancement over acceptor emission for large nanocrystals (30 nm or \xe2\x88\xbc15R0) with surface-anchored molecular acceptors. Our work shows that the migration-coupled approach can dramatically improve sensitivity in FRET-limited measurement, with potential applications ranging from facile photochemical synthesis to biological sensing and imaging at the single-molecule level."
"The transition-metal-catalyzed \xce\xb1-arylation of carbonyl compounds is a widely practiced method for C\xe2\x80\x93C bond formation. Several enantioselective versions of this process have been reported, but intermolecular, enantioselective coupling reactions of aryl electrophiles with \xce\xb1-fluoro carbonyl compounds have yet to be disclosed. We report enantioselective coupling of aryl and heteroaryl bromides and triflates with \xce\xb1-fluoroindanones catalyzed by palladium complexes of a BINOL-derived monophosphine and Segphos, respectively. The enolates were generated directly from \xce\xb1-fluoroindanones in the presence of potassium phosphate base during the reactions. We also report that reactions of \xce\xb1-fluorotetralones occur in high yields and enantioselectivities when conducted with enolates generated by elimination of trifluoroacetate from trifluoromethyl \xce\xb2-diketone hydrates. These reactions were catalyzed by palladium complexes of the commercially available bisphosphine Difluorphos. Thus, the formation of enantioenriched \xce\xb1-aryl-\xce\xb1-fluoroketones can be readily achieved by C\xe2\x80\x93C bond formation when the appropriate palladium catalyst and \xce\xb1-fluoro enolate precursor were used."
"Alkanethiolate protected gold nanoparticles are one of the most widely used systems in modern science and technology, where the emergent electronic properties of the gold core are valued for use in applications such as plasmonic solar cells, photocatalysis, and photothermal heating. Though choice in alkane chain length is not often discussed as a way in which to control the electronic properties of these nanoparticles, we show that the chain length of the alkyl tail exerts clear control over the electronic properties of the gold core, as determined by conduction electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The control exerted by chain length is reported on by changes to the g-factor of the metallic electrons, which we can relate to the average surface potential on the gold core. We propose that the surface potential is modulated by direct charge donation from the ligand to the metal, resulting from the formation of a chemical bond. Furthermore, the degree of charge transfer is controlled by differences between the dielectric constant of the medium and the ligand shell. Together, these observations are used to construct a simple electrostatic model that provides a framework for understanding how surface chemistry can be used to modulate the electronic properties of gold nanoparticles."
"Hydrogen transfer is the major route in catalytic conversion of methanol to olefins (MTO) for the formation of nonolefinic byproducts, including alkanes and aromatics. Two separate, noninterlinked hydrogen transfer pathways have been identified. In the absence of methanol, hydrogen transfer occurs between olefins and naphthenes via protonation of the olefin and the transfer of the hydride to the carbenium ion. A hitherto unidentified hydride transfer pathway involving Lewis and Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid sites dominates as long as methanol is present in the reacting mixture, leading to aromatics and alkanes. Experiments with purely Lewis acidic ZSM-5 showed that methanol and propene react on Lewis acid sites to HCHO and propane. In turn, HCHO reacts with olefins stepwise to aromatic molecules on Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid sites. The aromatic molecules formed at Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid sites have a high tendency to convert to irreversibly adsorbed carbonaceous deposits and are responsible for the critical deactivation in the methanol to olefin process."
"Various hypotheses have been proposed regarding how chain length, linkage type, position on substrate, and susceptibility to deubiquitinases (DUBs) affect processing of different substrates by proteasome. Here we report a new strategy for the chemical synthesis of ubiquitinated proteins to generate a set of well-defined conjugates bearing an oxime bond between the chain and the substrate. We confirmed that this isopeptide replacement is resistant to DUBs and to shaving by proteasome. Analyzing products generated by proteasomes ranked how chain length governed degradation outcome. Our results support that (1) the cleavage of the proximal isopeptide bond is not a prerequisite for proteasomal degradation, (2) by overcoming trimming at the proteasome, tetraUb is a fundamentally different signal than shorter chains, and (3) the tetra-ubiquitin chain can be degraded with the substrate. Together these results highlight the usefulness of chemistry to dissect the contribution of proteasome-associated DUBs and the complexity of the degradation process."
"We report on the protonation state of Helicobacter pylori catalase compound II. UV/visible, M\xc3\xb6ssbauer, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies have been used to examine the intermediate from pH 5 to 14. We have determined that HPC-II exists in an iron(IV) hydroxide state up to pH 11. Above this pH, the iron(IV) hydroxide complex transitions to a new species (pKa = 13.1) with M\xc3\xb6ssbauer parameters that are indicative of an iron(IV)-oxo intermediate. Recently, we discussed a role for an elevated compound II pKa in diminishing the compound I reduction potential. This has the effect of shifting the thermodynamic landscape toward the two-electron chemistry that is critical for catalase function. In catalase, a diminished potential would increase the selectivity for peroxide disproportionation over off-pathway one-electron chemistry, reducing the buildup of the inactive compound II state and reducing the need for energetically expensive electron donor molecules."
"Polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes continue to hold great promise as synthetic biology platforms for the production of novel therapeutic agents, biofuels, and commodity chemicals. Dehydratase (DH) catalytic domains play an important role during polyketide biosynthesis through the dehydration of the nascent polyketide intermediate to provide olefins. Our understanding of the detailed mechanistic and structural underpinning of DH domains that control substrate specificity and selectivity remains limited, thus hindering our efforts to rationally re-engineer PKSs. The curacin pathway houses a rare plurality of possible double bond permutations containing conjugated olefins as well as both cis- and trans-olefins, providing an unrivaled model system for polyketide dehydration. All four DH domains implicated in curacin biosynthesis were characterized in vitro using synthetic substrates, and activity was measured by LC-MS/MS analysis. These studies resulted in complete kinetic characterization of the all-trans-trienoate-forming CurK-DH, whose kcat of 72 s\xe2\x80\x931 is more than 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of any previously reported PKS DH domain. A novel stereospecific mechanism for diene formation involving a vinylogous enolate intermediate is proposed for the CurJ and CurH DHs on the basis of incubation studies with truncated substrates. A synthetic substrate was co-crystallized with a catalytically inactive Phe substitution in the His-Asp catalytic dyad of CurJ-DH to elucidate substrate\xe2\x80\x93enzyme interactions. The resulting complex suggested the structural basis for dienoate formation and provided the first glimpse into the enzyme\xe2\x80\x93substrate interactions essential for the formation of olefins in polyketide natural products. This examination of both canonical and non-canonical dehydration mechanisms reveals hidden catalytic activity inherent in some DH domains that may be leveraged for future applications in synthetic biology."
"The development of upscalable oxygen evolving electrocatalysts from earth-abundant metals able to operate in neutral or acidic environments and low overpotentials remains a fundamental challenge for the realization of artificial photosynthesis. In this study, we report a highly active phase of heterobimetallic cyanide-bridged electrocatalysts able to promote water oxidation under neutral, basic (pH < 13), and acidic conditions (pH > 1). Cobalt\xe2\x80\x93iron Prussian blue-type thin films, formed by chemical etching of Co(OH)1.0(CO3)0.5\xc2\xb7nH2O nanocrystals, yield a dramatic enhancement of the catalytic performance toward oxygen production, when compared with previous reports for analogous materials. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and structural studies confirm the excellent performance, stability, and corrosion resistance, even when compared with state-of-the-art metal oxide catalysts under moderate overpotentials and in a remarkably large pH range, including acid media where most cost-effective water oxidation catalysts are not useful. The origin of the superior electrocatalytic activity toward water oxidation appears to be in the optimized interfacial matching between catalyst and electrode surface obtained through this fabrication method."
"Targeting organelles by modulating the redox potential of mitochondria is a promising approach to kill cancer cells that minimizes acquired drug resistance. However, it lacks selectivity because mitochondria perform essential functions for (almost) all cells. We show that enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA), a bioinspired molecular process, selectively generates the assemblies of redox modulators (e.g., triphenyl phosphinium (TPP)) in the pericellular space of cancer cells for uptake, which allows selectively targeting the mitochondria of cancer cells. The attachment of TPP to a pair of enantiomeric, phosphorylated tetrapeptides produces the precursors (L-1P or D-1P) that form oligomers. Upon dephosphorylation catalyzed by ectophosphatases (e.g., alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) overexpressed on cancer cells (e.g., Saos2), the oligomers self-assemble to form nanoscale assemblies only on the surface of the cancer cells. The cancer cells thus uptake these assemblies of TPP via endocytosis, mainly via a caveolae/raft-dependent pathway. Inside the cells, the assemblies of TPP-peptide conjugates escape from the lysosome, induce dysfunction of mitochondria to release cytochrome c, and result in cell death, while the controls (i.e., omitting TPP motif, inhibiting ALP, or removing phosphate trigger) hardly kill the Saos2 cells. Most importantly, the repeated stimulation of the cancers by the precursors, unexpectedly, sensitizes the cancer cells to the precursors. As the first example of the integration of subcellular targeting with cell targeting, this study validates the spatial control of the assemblies of nonspecific cytotoxic agents by EISA as a promising molecular process for selectively killing cancer cells without inducing acquired drug resistance."
"Although major progress has recently been achieved through ex situ methods, there is still a lack of understanding of the behavior of the active center in non-precious metal Fe\xe2\x80\x93N/C catalysts under operating conditions. Utilizing nitrite, nitric oxide, and hydroxylamine as molecular probes, we show that the active site for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is different under acidic and alkaline conditions. An in-depth investigation of the ORR in acid reveals a behavior which is similar to that of iron macrocyclic complexes and suggests a contribution of the metal center in the catalytic cycle. We also show that this catalyst is highly active toward nitrite and nitric oxide electroreduction under various pH values with ammonia as a significant byproduct. This study offers fundamental insight into the chemical behavior of the active site and demonstrates a possible use of these materials for nitrite and nitric oxide sensing applications or environmental nitrite destruction."
"The multiplication of excitons in organic semiconductors via singlet fission offers the potential for photovoltaic cells that exceed the Shockley\xe2\x80\x93Quiesser limit for single-junction devices. To fully utilize the potential of singlet fission sensitizers in devices, it is necessary to understand and control the diffusion of the resultant triplet excitons. In this work, a new processing method is reported to systematically tune the intermolecular order and crystalline structure in films of a model singlet fission chromophore, 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-Pn), without the need for chemical modifications. A combination of transient absorption spectroscopy and quantitative materials characterization enabled a detailed examination of the distance- and time-dependence of triplet exciton diffusion following singlet fission in these nanocrystalline TIPS-Pn films. Triplet\xe2\x80\x93triplet annihilation rate constants were found to be representative of the weighted average of crystalline and amorphous phases in TIPS-Pn films comprising a mixture of phases. Adopting a diffusion model used to describe triplet\xe2\x80\x93triplet annihilation, the triplet diffusion lengths for nanocrystalline and amorphous films of TIPS-Pn were estimated to be \xe2\x88\xbc75 and \xe2\x88\xbc14 nm, respectively. Importantly, the presence of even a small fraction (<10%) of the amorphous phase in the TIPS-Pn films greatly decreased the ultimate triplet diffusion length, suggesting that pure crystalline materials may be essential to efficiently harvest multiplied triplets even when singlet fission occurs on ultrafast time scales."
"Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a unique polymer material with enormous applicability in many industrial and scientific fields. Here, its use as macromolecular crowder to mimic the cellular environment in vitro is the focus of the present study. We show that femtosecond mid-IR pump\xe2\x80\x93probe spectroscopy using three different IR probes, HDO, HN3, and azido-derivatized crowder, provides complete and stereoscopic information on water structure and dynamics in the cytoplasm-like macromolecular crowding environment. Our experimental results suggest two distinct subpopulations of water molecules: those that interact with other water molecules and those that are part of a hydration shell of crowder on its surface. Interestingly, water dynamics even in highly crowded environment remains bulk-like in spite of significant perturbation to the tetrahedral H-bonding network of water molecules. That is possible because of the formation of water aggregates (pools) even in water-deficient PEGDME-water solutions. In such a crowded environment, the conformationally accessible phase space of the macromolecular crowder is reduced, similar to biopolymers in highly crowded cytoplasm. Nonetheless, the hydration water on the surface of crowders slows down considerably with increased crowding. Most importantly, we do not observe any coalescing of surface hydration water (of the crowder) with bulk-like water to generate collective hydration dynamics at any crowder concentration, contrary to recent reports. We anticipate that the present triple-IR-probe approach is of exceptional use in studying how conformational states of crowders correlate with structural and dynamical changes of water, which is critical in understanding their key roles in biological and industrial applications."
"Because of their loosely bound electrons, electrides offer physical properties useful in chemical synthesis and electronics. For these applications and others, nanosized electrides offer advantages, but to-date no electride has been synthesized as a nanomaterial. We demonstrate experimentally that Ca2N, a layered electride in which layers of atoms are separated by layers of a 2D electron gas (2DEG), can be exfoliated into two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets using liquid exfoliation. The 2D flakes are stable in a nitrogen atmosphere or in select organic solvents for at least one month. Electron microscopy and elemental analysis reveal that the 2D flakes retain the crystal structure and stoichiometry of the parent 3D Ca2N. In addition, the 2D flakes exhibit metallic character and an optical response that agrees with DFT calculations. Together these findings suggest that the 2DEG is preserved in the 2D material. With this work, we bring electrides into the nanoregime and experimentally demonstrate a 2D electride, Ca2N."
"Detection and quantification of redox transformations involved in water oxidation electrocatalysis is often not possible using conventional techniques. Herein, use of large amplitude Fourier transformed ac voltammetry and comprehensive analysis of the higher harmonics has enabled us to access the redox processes responsible for catalysis. An examination of the voltammetric data for water oxidation in borate buffered solutions (pH 9.2) at electrodes functionalized with systematically varied low loadings of cobalt (CoOx), manganese (MnOx), and nickel oxides (NiOx) has been undertaken, and extensive experiment-simulation comparisons have been introduced for the first time. Analysis shows that a single redox process controls the rate of catalysis for Co and Mn oxides, while two electron transfer events contribute in the Ni case. We apply a \xe2\x80\x9cmolecular catalysis\xe2\x80\x9d model that couples a redox transformation of a surface-confined species (effective reversible potential, Eeff0) to a catalytic reaction with a substrate in solution (pseudo-first-order rate constant, k1f), accounts for the important role of a Br\xc3\xb8nsted base, and mimics the experimental behavior. The analysis revealed that Eeff0 values for CoOx, MnOx, and NiOx lie within the range 1.9\xe2\x80\x932.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, and k1f varies from 2 \xc3\x97 103 to 4 \xc3\x97 104 s\xe2\x80\x931. The k1f values are much higher than reported for any water electrooxidation catalyst before. The Eeff0 values provide a guide for in situ spectroscopic characterization of the active states involved in catalysis by metal oxides."
"This manuscript describes the design, synthesis, characterization, and reactivity studies of organometallic NiIII complexes of general structure TpNiIII(R)(R1) (Tp = tris(pyrazolyl)borate). With appropriate selection of the R and R1 ligands, the complexes are stable at room temperature and can be characterized by cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. Upon heating, many of these NiIII compounds undergo C(sp2)\xe2\x80\x93C(sp2) or C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93C(sp2) bond-forming reactions that are challenging at lower oxidation states of nickel."
"We present the assembly of asymmetric two-layer hybrid DNA-based hydrogels revealing stimuli-triggered reversibly modulated shape transitions. Asymmetric, linear hydrogels that include layer-selective switchable stimuli-responsive elements that control the hydrogel stiffness are designed. Trigger-induced stress in one of the layers results in the bending of the linear hybrid structure, thereby minimizing the elastic free energy of the systems. The removal of the stress by a counter-trigger restores the original linear bilayer hydrogel. The stiffness of the DNA hydrogel layers is controlled by thermal, pH (i-motif), K+ ion/crown ether (G-quadruplexes), chemical (pH-doped polyaniline), or biocatalytic (glucose oxidase/urease) triggers. A theoretical model relating the experimental bending radius of curvatures of the hydrogels with the Young\xe2\x80\x99s moduli and geometrical parameters of the hydrogels is provided. Promising applications of shape-regulated stimuli-responsive asymmetric hydrogels include their use as valves, actuators, sensors, and drug delivery devices."
"Copolymerizations of ethylene with vinyltrialkoxysilanes are reported using both a \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d cationic Pd(II) aryldiimine catalyst, t-1 (aryl = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl), and a \xe2\x80\x9csandwich-type\xe2\x80\x9d aryldiimine catalyst, s-2 (aryl = 8-tolylnaphthyl). Incorporation levels of vinyltrialkoxysilanes between 0.25 and 2.0 mol % were achieved with remarkably little rate retardation relative to ethylene homopolymerizations. In the case of the traditional catalyst system, molecular weights decrease as the level of comonomer increases and only one trialkoxysilyl group is incorporated per chain. Molecular weight distributions of ca. 2 are observed. For the sandwich catalyst, higher molecular weights are observed with many more trialkoxysilyl groups incorporated per chain. Polymers with molecular weight distributions of ca. 1.2\xe2\x80\x931.4 are obtained. Detailed NMR mechanistic studies have revealed the formation of intermediate \xcf\x80-complexes of the type (diimine)Pd(alkyl)(vinyltrialkoxysilane)+. 1,2-Migratory insertions of these complexes occur with rates similar to ethylene insertion and result in formation of observable five-membered chelate intermediates. These chelates are rapidly opened with ethylene forming alkyl ethylene complexes, a requirement for chain growth. An unusual \xce\xb2-silyl elimination mechanism was shown to be responsible for chain transfer and formation of low molecular weight copolymers in the traditional catalyst system, t-1. This chain transfer process is retarded in the sandwich system. Relative binding affinities of ethylene and vinyltrialkoxysilanes to the cationic palladium center have been determined. The quantitative mechanistic studies reported fully explain the features of the bulk polymerization results."
"Supported gold (Au) nanocatalysts hold great promise for heterogeneous catalysis; however, their practical application is greatly hampered by poor thermodynamic stability. Herein, a general synthetic strategy is reported where discrete metal nanoparticles are made resistant to sintering, preserving their catalytic activities in high-temperature oxidation processes. Taking advantage of the unique coating chemistry of dopamine, sacrificial carbon layers are constructed on the material surface, stabilizing the supported catalyst. Upon annealing at high temperature under an inert atmosphere, the interactions between support and metal nanoparticle are dramatically enhanced, while the sacrificial carbon layers can be subsequently removed through oxidative calcination in air. Owing to the improved metal\xe2\x80\x93support contact and strengthened electronic interactions, the resulting Au nanocatalysts are resistant to sintering and exhibit excellent durability for catalytic combustion of propylene at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the facile synthetic strategy can be extended to the stabilization of other supported catalysts on a broad range of supports, providing a general approach to enhancing the thermal stability and sintering resistance of supported nanocatalysts."
"The combination of Pt0 complexes and indium trihalides leads to compounds that form equilibria in solution between their In\xe2\x80\x93X oxidative addition (OA) products (PtII indyl complexes) and their metal-only Lewis pair (MOLP) isomers (LnPt\xe2\x86\x92InX3). The position of the equilibria can be altered reversibly by changing the solvent, while the equilibria can be reversibly and irreversibly driven toward the MOLP products by addition of further donor ligands. The results mark the first observation of an equilibrium between MOLP and OA isomers, as well as the most polar bond ever observed to undergo reversible oxidative addition to a metal complex. In addition, we present the first structural characterization of MOLP and oxidative addition isomers of the same compound. The relative energies of the MOLP and OA isomers were calculated by DFT methods, and the possibility of solvent-mediated isomerization is discussed."
"A mixed-valent Cu(I)Cu(II) complex, [CuI,II2(UN-O\xe2\x80\x93)]2+ (1), reacts with NO(g) at \xe2\x88\x9280 \xc2\xb0C to form [CuI,II2(UN-O\xe2\x80\x93)(NO)]2+ (2), best described as a mixed-valent nitrosyl complex that has a \xce\xbd(N\xe2\x80\x93O) band at 1670 cm\xe2\x80\x931 in its infrared (IR) spectrum. Complex 2 undertakes a one-electron oxidation via the addition of O2(g) to generate a new intermediate, best described as a superoxide and nitrosyl adduct, [CuII2(UN-O\xe2\x80\x93)(NO)(O2\xe2\x80\x93)]2+ (3), based on its distinctively blue-shifted \xce\xbd(N\xe2\x80\x93O) band at 1853 cm\xe2\x80\x931. Over the course of 20 min at \xe2\x88\x9280 \xc2\xb0C, 3 is converted to the peroxynitrite (PN) complex [CuII2(UN-O\xe2\x80\x93)(\xe2\x88\x92OON\xe2\x95\x90O)]2+ (4), which was characterized by low-temperature electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and IR spectroscopy; \xce\xbd(N\xe2\x80\x93O) absorptions at 1520 and 1640 cm\xe2\x80\x931 have been assigned as cis- and trans-conformers of the PN ligand in 4. Alternatively, the superoxide complex [CuII2(UN-O\xe2\x80\x93)(O2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x93)]2+ (5) is found to react with NO(g) to generate the same intermediate superoxide and nitrosyl adduct 3 (based on IR criteria), which likewise converts to the same PN complex 4. The O\xe2\x80\x93O bond in 4 undergoes heterolysis in dichloromethane solvent and is postulated to produce nitronium ion, leading to ortho-nitration of 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (DTBP). However, in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran as solvent, the O\xe2\x80\x93O bond undergoes homolysis to generate \xe2\x80\xa2NO2 (detected spectrophotometrically) and a putative higher-valent complex, [CuII,III2(UN-O\xe2\x80\x93)(O2\xe2\x80\x93)]2+, that abstracts a H-atom from DTBP to give [CuII2(UN-O\xe2\x80\x93)(OH)]2+ and a phenoxyl radical. The latter may dimerize to form the bis-phenol observed experimentally or couple with the \xe2\x80\xa2NO2 present, leading to o-phenol nitration."
"The stability of chemical bonds can be studied experimentally by rupturing single molecule junctions under applied voltage. Here, we compare voltage-induced bond rupture in two Si\xe2\x80\x93Si backbones: one has no alternate conductive pathway whereas the other contains an additional naphthyl pathway in parallel to the Si\xe2\x80\x93Si bond. We show that in contrast to the first system, the second can conduct through the naphthyl group when the Si\xe2\x80\x93Si bond is ruptured using an applied voltage. We investigate this voltage induced Si\xe2\x80\x93Si bond rupture by ab initio density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations that ultimately demonstrate that the excitation of molecular vibrational modes by tunneling electrons leads to homolytic Si\xe2\x80\x93Si bond rupture."
"CH3OH on a single-crystal rutile TiO2(110) surface is a widely studied model system for heterogeneous photocatalysis. Using spin-polarized density functional theory with a hybrid functional (HSE06), we study the photocatalytic oxidation of CH3OH adsorbed at a coordinately unsaturated Ti site as an excited-state process with triplet spin multiplicity. The oxidation to CH2O is stepwise and involves a CH3O intermediate. The first O\xe2\x80\x93H dissociation step follows an excitonic interfacial proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism where the hole\xe2\x80\x93electron (h\xe2\x80\x93e) pair generated during the excitation is bound, and the h is transferred to the adsorbate. The O\xe2\x80\x93H dissociation paths associated with other h\xe2\x80\x93e pairs are unreactive, and the moderate experimental efficiency is due to the different reactivity of the h\xe2\x80\x93e pairs. The excited-state CH3O intermediate further deactivates through a seam of intersection between the ground and excited states. It can follow three different paths, regeneration of adsorbed CH3OH or formation of the ground-state CH3O anion or an adsorbed CH2O radical anion. The third channel corresponds to photochemical CH2O formation from CH3OH, where a single photon induces one electron oxidation and transfer of two protons. These results expand the current view on the photocatalysis of CH3OH on TiO2(110) by highlighting the role of excitons and showing that adsorbed CH3OH may also be an active species in the photocatalytic oxidation to CH2O."
"Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a critical process due to its fundamental role in electrocatalysis. Practically, the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for HER in alkaline media is of great importance for the conversion of renewable energy to hydrogen fuel via photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, both mechanistic exploration and materials development for HER under alkaline conditions are very limited. Precious Pt metal, which still serves as the state-of-the-art catalyst for HER, is unable to guarantee a sustainable hydrogen supply. Here we report an anomalously structured Ru catalyst that shows 2.5 times higher hydrogen generation rate than Pt and is among the most active HER electrocatalysts yet reported in alkaline solutions. The identification of new face-centered cubic crystallographic structure of Ru nanoparticles was investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging, and its formation mechanism was revealed by spectroscopic characterization and theoretical analysis. For the first time, it is found that the Ru nanocatalyst showed a pronounced effect of the crystal structure on the electrocatalytic activity tested under different conditions. The combination of electrochemical reaction rate measurements and density functional theory computation shows that the high activity of anomalous Ru catalyst in alkaline solution originates from its suitable adsorption energies to some key reaction intermediates and reaction kinetics in the HER process."
"(Z,Z)-3,5-Octadiene-1,7-diynes 15a\xe2\x88\x92e were synthesized by condensation of enynyl aldehydes 12a\xe2\x88\x92e with allenylborane 11 to furnish enynyl alcohols 14a\xe2\x88\x92e followed by the elimination step of the Peterson olefination reaction. Desilylation of 15a with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) followed by two consecutive electrocyclizations resulted in the formation of the corresponding benzocyclobutadiene 17a, leading to the four angular dimers 18a\xe2\x88\x92d. The use of cyclopentadiene to capture 17a afforded the Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder adduct 19. Treatment of 15b with TBAF produced only one angular dimer 21. On the other hand, the presence of a phenyl substituent on the four-membered ring directed the dimerization of benzocyclobutadiene 17c toward the linear dimer 23, which then underwent a facile thermal rearrangement to dibenzocyclooctadiene 24. Interestingly, benzocyclobutadienes 17d and 17e having an alkenyl substituent on the four-membered ring dimerized via a formal [4 + 4] cycloaddition to the 1,5-cyclooctadienes 26 and 32, respectively.

"A general, high-yielding approach leads to the synthesis of oligo-rotaxanes, mechanically interlocked with a single linear axle threading multiple different rings arranged in a precise order."
"Tryptophan lyase (NosL) is a radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 3-methyl-2-indolic acid from l-tryptophan. In this paper, we demonstrate that the 5\xe2\x80\xb2-deoxyadenosyl radical is considerably more versatile in its chemistry than previously anticipated: hydrogen atom abstraction from N\xce\xb1-cyclopropyltryptophan occurs at C\xce\xb1 rather than the amino group with NosL Y90A and replacing the substrate amine with a ketone or an alkene changes the chemistry from hydrogen atom abstraction to double bond addition. In addition, the 5\xe2\x80\xb2-deoxyadenosyl radical can add to the [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S] cluster and dithionite can be used to trap radicals at the active site."
"To demonstrate that measurements of X-ray linear dichroism are effective for determining bond orientations in disordered materials, we report the first observation of X-ray linear dichroism at the iodine L1-edge. The iodine-containing molecular solid studied in this work was the inclusion compound containing 4,4\xe2\x80\xb2-diiodobiphenyl guest molecules in the perhydrotriphenylene host structure. In this material, the guest substructure does not exhibit three-dimensional ordering, and thus diffraction-based techniques do not provide insights on the orientational properties of the guest molecules. Iodine L1-edge X-ray absorption spectra, recorded as a function of orientation of a single crystal of the material, exhibit significant dichroism (whereas no dichroism is observed at the iodine L2- and L3-edges). From quantitative analysis of the X-ray dichroism, the orientational properties of the C\xe2\x80\x93I bonds within this material are established. The results pave the way for applying X-ray dichroism to determine molecular orientational properties of other materials, especially for partially ordered materials such as liquid crystals, confined liquids, and disordered crystalline phases, for which diffraction techniques may not be applicable."
"We introduce a hybrid organic\xe2\x80\x93inorganic system consisting of epitaxial NaYF4:Yb3+/X3+@NaYbF4@NaYF4:Nd3+ (X = null, Er, Ho, Tm, or Pr) core/shell/shell (CSS) nanocrystal with organic dye, indocyanine green (ICG) on the nanocrystal surface. This system is able to produce a set of narrow band emissions with a large Stokes-shift (>200 nm) in the second biological window of optical transparency (NIR-II, 1000\xe2\x80\x931700 nm), by directional energy transfer from light-harvesting surface ICG, via lanthanide ions in the shells, to the emitter X3+ in the core. Surface ICG not only increases the NIR-II emission intensity of inorganic CSS nanocrystals by \xe2\x88\xbc4-fold but also provides a broadly excitable spectral range (700\xe2\x80\x93860 nm) that facilitates their use in bioapplications. We show that the NIR-II emission from ICG-sensitized Er3+-doped CSS nanocrystals allows clear observation of a sharp image through 9 mm thick chicken breast tissue, and emission signal detection through 22 mm thick tissue yielding a better imaging profile than from typically used Yb/Tm-codoped upconverting nanocrystals imaged in the NIR-I region (700\xe2\x80\x93950 nm). Our result on in vivo imaging suggests that these ICG-sensitized CSS nanocrystals are suitable for deep optical imaging in the NIR-II region."
"Organic\xe2\x80\x93inorganic hybrid perovskite single-crystalline thin films (SCTFs) are promising for enhancing photoelectric device performance due to high carrier mobility, long diffusion length, and carrier lifetime. However, bulk perovskite single crystals available today are not suitable for practical device application due to the unfavorable thickness. Herein, we report a facile space-confined solution-processed strategy to on-substrate grow various hybrid perovskite SCTFs in a size of submillimeter with adjustable thicknesses from nano- to micrometers. These SCTFs exhibit photoelectric properties comparable to bulk single crystals with low defect density and good air stability. The clear thickness-dependent colors allow fast visual selection of SCTFs with a suitable thickness for specific device application. The present substrate-independent growth of perovskite SCTFs opens up opportunities for on-chip fabrication of diverse high-performance devices."
"Selective functionalization of ubiquitous C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H bonds using visible light is a highly challenging yet desirable goal in organic synthesis. The development of such processes relies on both rational design and serendipitous discoveries from innovative tools such as screening technologies. Applying a mechanism-based screening strategy, we herein report photoredox-mediated hydrogen atom transfer catalysis for the selective activation of otherwise unactivated C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H bonds, followed by their trifluoromethylthiolation, which has high potential as a late-stage functionalization tool. The generality of this method is exhibited through incorporation of the trifluoromethylthio group in a large number of C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H bonds with high selectivity without the need for an excess of valuable substrate."
"Photocatalysis is a promising technology for renewable energy production. Many photocatalysis have realized the visible-light-driven catalytic activity. However, it is still difficult to achieve the enhanced photocatalytic activity with tunable wavelength. We have designed tunable wavelength enhanced photoelectrochemical cells by tuning the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks, which can be controlled by the aspect ratios of the Au nanorods, for both the cathode with the hydrogen evolution reaction and the anode with the electrooxidation of methanol reaction. The optimal photocatalytic activity of the hydrogen evolution and electrooxidation of the methanol can be realized only when the illuminating wavelength matches with the SPR peaks, which is quite selective to the illuminating wavelength. The blue shift of the SPR peak increases the photoelectrocatalytic effect whereas the red shift enhances the photothermal effect. Such studies provide a useful way for improving the photocatalytic activity and the selectivity of the photocatalytic reactions by adjusting the illuminating wavelength."
"Unsubstituted and structurally well-defined poly(para-phenylene) (PPP) has been long-desired as an organic semiconductor prototype of conjugated polymers. To date, several attempts to synthesize unsubstituted, pristine, high-molecular-weight PPP have failed. Here we solved this synthetic problem by a versatile precursor route. Suzuki polymerization of kinked disubstituted 1,4-dimethoxycyclohexadienylene monomers yielded a well-soluble, nonaromatic precursor polymer. Its solubility allowed processing by spin-coating into nanometer-thick films. Subsequent additive-free thermal treatment induced aromatization and led to exclusively para-connected, highly fluorescent PPP with a length of about 75 phenylene units."
"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne virus recently linked to intrauterine growth restriction including abnormal fetal brain development. The recent outbreak of ZIKV reached pandemic level resulting in an alarming public health emergency. At present, there is limited understanding of the infectious mechanism and no approved therapy. Nonstructural protein 5 is essential for capping and replication of viral RNA and comprises a methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase domain. Here we used molecular modeling to obtain the structure of ZIKV MTase and molecular docking to identify the additional hydrophobic region uniquely conserved in flavivirus MTase that can be used as a druggable site. Subsequently, a virtual screening with a library of 28\xe2\x80\xaf341 compounds identified 10 best hits showing decisive contacts with the MTase. In vitro efficacy analysis of these compounds against ZIKV, by plaque reduction assay, has confirmed four of the top scored ligands (Life Chemicals ID: F3043-0013, F0922-0796, F1609-0442, and F1750-0048) having EC50 (50% effective concentration) values of 4.8 \xc2\xb1 2.3, 12.5 \xc2\xb1 7.4, 17.5 \xc2\xb1 8.4, and 17.6 \xc2\xb1 3.1 \xce\xbcM respectively, identifying lead compounds for anti-ZIKV drug development."
"Two-dimensional (2D) metallic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as 1T-TiSe2, are ideal systems for exploring the fundamentals in condensed matter physics. However, controlled synthesis of these ultrathin materials has not been achieved. Here, we explored the synthesis of charge density wave (CDW)-bearing 2D TiSe2 with chemical vapor transport (CVT) by extending this bulk crystal growth approach to the surface growth of TiSe2 by introducing suitable growth substrates and dramatically slowing down the growth rate. Sub-10 nm TiSe2 flakes were successfully obtained, showing comparable quality to the mechanically exfoliated thin flakes. A CDW state with 2 \xc3\x97 2 superstructure was clearly observed on these ultrathin flakes by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and the phase transition temperature of these flakes was investigated by transport measurements, confirming the existence of CDW states. Our work opens up a new approach to synthesizing 2D CDW and superconductive TMDCs for exploring new fundamentals and applications in novel electronics."
"Toward the preparation of a coordination complex of the heterodiatomic molecule PN, P\xe2\x89\xa1N-V(N[tBu]Ar)3 (1, Ar = 3,5-Me2C6H3), we report the use of ClPA (A = C14H10, anthracene) as a formal source of phosphorus(I) in its reaction with Na[NV(N[tBu]Ar)3] (Na[4]) to yield trimeric cyclo-triphosphane [PNV(N[tBu]Ar)3]3 (3) with a core composed exclusively of phosphorus and nitrogen. In the presence of NapS2 (peri-1,8-naphthalene disulfide), NapS2P-NV(N[tBu]Ar)3 (6) is instead generated in 80% yield, suggesting trapping of transient 1. Upon mild heating, 3 readily fragments into dimeric [PNV(N[tBu]Ar)3]2 (2), while in the presence of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene or cis-4-octene, the respective phosphirene (Ar[tBu]N)3VN-PC2(SiMe3)2 (7) or phosphirane (Ar[tBu]N)3VN-P(C8H16) (8) compounds are generated. Kinetic data were found to be consistent with unimolecular decay of 3, and [2+1]-cycloaddition with radical clocks ruled out a triplet intermediate, consistent with intermediate 1 reacting as a singlet phosphinidene. In addition, both 7 and 8 were shown to reversibly exchange cis-4-octene and bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene, serving as formal sources of 1, a reactivity manifold traditionally reserved for transition metals."
"Highly directional white-light generation was recently reported for the organotin sulfide cluster [(StySn)4S6] (Sty = p-styryl). This effect was tentatively attributed to the amorphous nature of the material in combination with the specific combination of an inversion-symmetry-free T/E cluster core (T = tetrel, E = chalcogen) with the attachment of ligands that allow \xcf\x80 delocalization of the electron density. Systematic variation of T and the organic ligand (R) that runs from T = Si through Ge to Sn and from R = methyl through phenyl and p-styryl to 1-naphthyl provides a more comprehensive view. According to powder X-ray data, only [(PhSi)4S6] is single-crystalline among the named combinations. Here we demonstrate the fine-tuneability of the nonlinear response, i.e., changing from white-light generation to second-harmonic generation as well as controlling the white-light properties. These are investigated as a function of T, \xcf\x80 delocalization of the electron density within R, and the order within the molecular solids."
"The physical characteristics of composite materials are dictated by both the chemical composition and spatial configuration of each constituent phase. A major challenge in nanoparticle-based composites is developing methods to precisely dictate particle positions at the nanometer length scale, as this would allow complete control over nanocomposite structure\xe2\x80\x93property relationships. In this work, we present a new class of building blocks called nanocomposite tectons (NCTs), which consist of inorganic nanoparticles grafted with a dense layer of polymer chains that terminate in molecular recognition units capable of programmed supramolecular bonding. By tuning various design factors, including the particle size and polymer length, we can use the supramolecular interactions between NCTs to controllably alter their assembly behavior, enabling the formation of well-ordered body-centered cubic superlattices consisting of inorganic nanoparticles surrounded by polymer chains. NCTs therefore present a modular platform that enables the construction of composite materials where the composition and three-dimensional arrangement of different constituents within the composite can be independently controlled."
"Using bulky amides as the structure-directing agents (SDAs) is an alternative synthetic strategy for the exploration of crystalline large pore (\xe2\x89\xa512-membered ring) zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Specifically, by using the bulky amides, dibutylformamide (DBF) and dipropylformamide (DPF) as solvent and imidazole (Im) as a ligand, two ZIFs mimicking the CAN and AlPO-5 (AFI) zeotypes with 12-membered ring (MR) pore openings were synthesized, and denoted as CAN-[Zn(Im)2] and AFI-[Zn(Im)2], respectively. These two materials are the first known examples of Zn(Im)2 polymorphs with 12-MR pores and AFI-[Zn(Im)2] has the largest pore apertures reported to date for ZIF materials. The concept that the bulky amides used were not simply acting as the solvent, but were in fact acting as SDAs or templates during the synthesis of the large pore ZIFs, was suggested by the closeness of the geometrical fit between the guest DBF and the can cages (composite building units) of the CAN-[Zn(Im)2]."
"To obtain stable and ultrafine Pt nanoclusters, a trigonal prismatic coordination cage with the sulfur atoms on the edges was solvothermally synthesized to confine them. In the structure of {Ni24(TC4A-SO2)6(TDC)12 (H2O)6} (H4TC4A-SO2 = p-tert-butylsulfonylcalix[4]arene; H2TDC = 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid), three Ni4-(TC4A-SO2) SBUs are bridged by three TDC ligands into a triangle and two such triangles are pillared by three pairs of TDC ligands to form a trigonal prism. The cage cavity has 12 sulfur atoms on the surface. Because of the porous structure and strong covalent interaction between metal and sulfur, ultrafine Pt nanoclusters composed of less than \xe2\x88\xbc18 Pt atoms can be facilely confined in the present trigonal prismatic cage (Pt@CIAC-121). The as-synthesized Pt NCs exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity than commercial Pt/C toward hydrogen evolution reaction."
Asymmetric arylation of alkylnitriles forms quaternary stereocenters in good enantiocontrol for the first time. A lithium heterodimer consisting of an alkylnitrile anion and a disilylamide ion is the actual species responsible for the stereodetermining transmetalation in the catalytic cycle.
"The first use of vicinal diols, ketols, or diones as 22\xcf\x80 components in metal-catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition is described. Using ruthenium(0) catalysts, 1,6-diynes form ruthenacyclopentadienes that engage transient diones in successive carbonyl addition. Transfer hydrogenolysis of the resulting ruthenium(II) diolate mediated by the diol or ketol reactant releases the cycloadduct with regeneration of ruthenium(0) and the requisite dione."
"Recently reported Pd-mediated one-pot ketone synthesis from an unactivated alkyl bromide and a thioester has been extended to a macrocyclic ketone synthesis. In situ generation of alkylzinc halide via single electron transfer (SET), using NbCpCl4 and CrCl3, was the key for the success of macrocyclization. A new convergent synthesis of eribulin has been achieved, using (1) catalytic asymmetric Ni/Cr-mediated coupling to form the C19\xe2\x80\x93C20 bond, (2) base-induced cyclization to form the methylenetetrahydrofuran ring, and (3) Pd-mediated one-pot ketone synthesis to form the macrocyclic ketone."
"The color variations of light emitted by some natural and mutant luciferases are normally attributed to collective factors referred to as microenvironment effects; however, the exact nature of these interactions between the emitting molecule (oxyluciferin) and the active site remains elusive. Although model studies of noncomplexed oxyluciferin and its variants have greatly advanced the understanding of its photochemistry, extrapolation of the conclusions to the real system requires assumptions about the polarity and proticity of the active site. To decipher the intricate excited-state dynamics, global and target analysis is performed here for the first time on the steady-state and time-resolved spectra of firefly oxyluciferin complexed with luciferase from the Japanese firefly (Luciola cruciata). The experimental steady-state and time-resolved luminescence spectra of the oxyluciferin/luciferase complex in solution are compared with the broadband time-resolved firefly bioluminescence recorded in vivo. The results demonstrate that de-excitation of the luminophore results in a complex cascade of photoinduced proton transfer processes and can be interpreted by the pH dependence of the emitted light. It is confirmed that proton transfer is the central event in the spectrochemistry of this system for which any assignment of the pH-dependent emission to a single chemical species would be an oversimplification."
"Aggregation and amyloid fibril formation of peptides and proteins is a widespread phenomenon. It has serious implications in a range of areas from biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications to medical disorders. The aim of this study was to develop a better understanding of the mechanism of aggregation and amyloid fibrillation of an important pharmaceutical, human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 is a 31-residue hormone peptide that plays an important role regulating blood glucose levels, analogues of which are used for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Amyloid fibril formation of GLP-1 was monitored using thioflavin T fluorescence as a function of peptide concentration between pH 7.5 and 8.2. Results from these studies establish that there is a highly unusual pH-induced switch in GLP-1 aggregation kinetics. At pH 8.2, the kinetics are consistent with a nucleation\xe2\x80\x93polymerization mechanism for fibril formation. However, at pH 7.5, highly unusual kinetics are observed, where the lag time increases with increasing peptide concentration. We attribute this result to the formation of off-pathway species together with an initial slow, unimolecular step where monomer converts to a different monomeric form that forms on-pathway oligomers and ultimately fibrils. Estimation of the pKa values of all the ionizable groups in GLP-1 suggest it is the protonation/deprotonation of the N-terminus that is responsible for the switch with pH. In addition, a range of biophysical techniques were used to characterize (1) the start point of the aggregation reaction and (2) the structure and stability of the fibrils formed. These results show that the off-pathway species form under conditions where GLP-1 is most prone to form oligomers."
"The hexachlorocerate(III) anion, [CeIIICl6]3\xe2\x80\x93, was found to be a potent photoreductant in acetonitrile solution with an estimated excited-state reduction potential of \xe2\x88\x923.45 V versus Cp2Fe0/+. Despite a short lifetime of 22.1(1) ns, the anion exhibited a photoluminescence quantum yield of 0.61(4) and fast quenching kinetics toward organohalogens allowing for its application in the photocatalytic reduction of aryl chloride substrates."
"Sequence-specific peptides have been demonstrated to self-assemble into structurally defined nanoscale objects including nanofibers, nanotubes, and nanosheets. The latter structures display significant promise for the construction of hybrid materials for functional devices due to their extended planar geometry. Realization of this objective necessitates the ability to control the structural features of the resultant assemblies through the peptide sequence. The design of a amphiphilic peptide, 3FD-IL, is described that comprises two repeats of a canonical 18 amino acid sequence associated with straight \xce\xb1-helical structures. Peptide 3FD-IL displays 3-fold screw symmetry in a helical conformation and self-assembles into nanosheets based on hexagonal packing of helices. Biophysical evidence from TEM, cryo-TEM, SAXS, AFM, and STEM measurements on the 3FD-IL nanosheets support a structural model based on a honeycomb lattice, in which the length of the peptide determines the thickness of the nanosheet and the packing of helices defines the presence of nanoscale channels that permeate the sheet. The honeycomb structure can be rationalized on the basis of geometrical packing frustration in which the channels occupy defect sites that define a periodic superlattice. The resultant 2D materials may have potential as materials for nanoscale transport and controlled release applications."
"HIV-1 Protease (HIV-1 PR) is one of the three enzymes essential for the replication process of HIV-1 virus, which explains why it has been the main target for design of drugs against acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This work is focused on exploring the proteolysis reaction catalyzed by HIV-1 PR, with special attention to the dynamic and electrostatic effects governing its catalytic power. Free energy surfaces for all possible mechanisms have been computed in terms of potentials of mean force (PMFs) within hybrid QM/MM potentials, with the QM subset of atoms described at semiempirical (AM1) and DFT (M06-2X) level. The results suggest that the most favorable reaction mechanism involves formation of a gem-diol intermediate, whose decomposition into the product complex would correspond to the rate-limiting step. The agreement between the activation free energy of this step with experimental data, as well as kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), supports this prediction. The role of the protein dynamic was studied by protein isotope labeling in the framework of the Variational Transition State Theory. The predicted enzyme KIEs, also very close to the values measured experimentally, reveal a measurable but small dynamic effect. Our calculations show how the contribution of dynamic effects to the effective activation free energy appears to be below 1 kcal\xc2\xb7mol\xe2\x80\x931. On the contrary, the electric field created by the protein in the active site of the enzyme emerges as being critical for the electronic reorganization required during the reaction. These electrostatic properties of the active site could be used as a mold for future drug design."
"New approaches in molecular nanoscopy are greatly desired for interrogation of biological, organic, and inorganic objects with sizes below the diffraction limit. Our current work investigates emergent monolayer-protected gold quantum dots (nanoclusters, NCs) composed of 25 Au atoms by utilizing two-photon-excited fluorescence (TPEF) near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) at single NC concentrations. Here, we demonstrate an approach to synthesize and isolate single NCs on solid glass substrates. Subsequent investigation of the NCs using TPEF NSOM reveals that, even when they are separated by distances of several tens of nanometers, we can excite and interrogate single NCs individually. Interestingly, we observe an enhanced two-photon absorption (TPA) cross section for single Au25 NCs that can be attributed to few-atom local field effects and to local field-induced microscopic cascading, indicating their potential for use in ultrasensitive sensing, disease diagnostics, cancer cell therapy, and molecular computers. Finally, we report room-temperature aperture-based TPEF NSOM imaging of these NCs for the first time at 30 nm point resolution, which is a \xe2\x88\xbc5-fold improvement compared to the previous best result for the same technique. This report unveils the unique combination of an unusually large TPA cross section and the high photostability of Au NCs to (non-destructively) investigate stable isolated single NCs using TPEF NSOM. This is the first reported optical study of monolayer-protected single quantum clusters, opening some very promising opportunities in spectroscopy of nanosized objects, bioimaging, ultrasensitive sensing, molecular computers, and high-density data storage."
"DNA-induced rate acceleration has been identified as one of the key elements for the success of the DNA-based catalysis concept. Here we report on a novel DNA-based catalytic Friedel\xe2\x80\x93Crafts conjugate addition/enantioselective protonation reaction in water, which represents the first example of a reaction that critically depends on the >700- to 990-fold rate acceleration caused by the presence of a DNA scaffold. The DNA-induced rate acceleration observed is the highest reported due to the environment presented by a biomolecular scaffold for any hybrid catalyst, to date. Based on a combination of kinetics and binding studies, it is proposed that the rate acceleration is in part due to the DNA acting as a pseudophase, analogous to micelles, in which all reaction components are concentrated, resulting in a high effective molarity. The involvement of additional second coordination sphere interactions is suggested by the enantioselectivity of the product. The results presented here show convincingly that the DNA-based catalysis concept, thanks to the DNA-accelerating effect, can be an effective approach to achieving a chemically challenging reaction in water."
"Amphiphilic porphyrins are of great interest in the field of supramolecular chemistry because they can be fabricated into highly ordered architectures that are stabilized by \xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93\xcf\x80 stacking of porphine rings as well as by non-covalent interactions between their hydrophilic substituents. Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) has two flexible propionic acid tails and is one of the most common amphiphilic porphyrins. However, unlike other PPIX analogues, PPIX does not form stable extended nanostructures, and the reason for this is still not understood. Here, we employ ion mobility mass spectrometry in combination with infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy to investigate early aggregates of PPIX. The ion mobility results show that growth occurs via single-stranded face-to-face stacking of PPIX. From the infrared spectroscopy on well-defined aggregates, it can be concluded that pairing of the carboxylic acid groups of the tails is a stabilizing element and that such a pairing occurs across a third residue from residue n to residue n+2. The tetramer appears to be especially stable, because all of its propionic acid tails are optimally paired and no free tails to promote further growth are present, which possibly prevents PPIX from forming larger, well-ordered assemblies."
"Long-term stability of the properties of nanocrystals (NCs) is of paramount importance for any applicative development. However, these are jeopardized by chemical and structural alterations of the NCs induced by the environment and the working conditions. Among the species that alter the NCs properties, water molecules are of tremendous importance. We used 17O solid-state NMR spectroscopy to follow this process and the dynamics of O atoms in metal oxide NCs. Using ZnO as reference material, different chemical environments for the O atoms are characterized and a dynamic exchange process between the NCs and the O atoms from water is evidenced. The exchange does not involve only surface atoms but also ones located deeper inside the ZnO core of the NCs. Finally, a postsynthesis process based on watering/drying cycles is proposed that may greatly improve the long-term stability of metal oxide NCs."
"We present an operationally simple iterative coupling strategy for the synthesis of oligomeric homo- and hetero[n]rotaxanes with precise control over the position of each macrocycle. The exceptional yield of the AT-CuAAC reaction, combined with optimized conditions that allow the rapid synthesis of the target oligomers, opens the door to the study of precision-engineered oligomeric interlocked molecules."
"Poly-p-phenylene wires are critically important as charge-transfer materials in photovoltaics. A comparative analysis of a series of poly-p-phenylene (RPPn) wires, capped with isoalkyl (iAPPn), alkoxy (ROPPn), and dialkylamino (R2NPPn) groups, shows unexpected evolution of oxidation potentials, i.e., decrease (\xe2\x88\x92260 mV) for iAPPn, while increase for ROPPn (+100 mV) and R2NPPn (+350 mV) with increasing number of p-phenylenes. Moreover, redox/optical properties and DFT calculations of R2NPPn/R2NPPn+\xe2\x80\xa2 further show that the symmetric bell-shaped hole distribution distorts and shifts toward one end of the molecule with only 4 p-phenylenes in R2NPPn+\xe2\x80\xa2, while shifting of the hole occurs with 6 and 8 p-phenylenes in ROPPn+\xe2\x80\xa2 and iAPPn+\xe2\x80\xa2, respectively. Availability of accurate experimental data on highly electron-rich dialkylamino-capped R2NPPn together with ROPPn and iAPPn allowed us to demonstrate, using our recently developed Marcus-based multistate model (MSM), that an increase of oxidation potentials in R2NPPn arises due to an interplay between the electronic coupling (Hab) and energy difference between the end-capped groups and bridging phenylenes (\xce\x94\xce\xb5). A comparison of the three series of RPPn with varied \xce\x94\xce\xb5 further demonstrates that decrease/increase/no change in oxidation energies of RPPn can be predicted based on the energy gap \xce\x94\xce\xb5 and coupling Hab, i.e., decrease if \xce\x94\xce\xb5 < Hab (i.e., iAPPn), increase if \xce\x94\xce\xb5 > Hab (i.e., R2NPPn), and minimal change if \xce\x94\xce\xb5 \xe2\x89\x88 Hab (i.e., ROPPn). MSM also reproduces the switching of the nature of electronic transition in higher homologues of R2NPPn+\xe2\x80\xa2 (n \xe2\x89\xa5 4). These findings will aid in the development of improved models for charge-transfer dynamics in donor\xe2\x80\x93bridge\xe2\x80\x93acceptor systems."
"Hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid catalysis. However, the hydrogen bond properties responsible for the activation of the substrate are still under debate. Here, we report an in depth study of the properties and geometries of the hydrogen bonds in (R)-TRIP imine complexes (TRIP: 3,3\xe2\x80\xb2-Bis(2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl)-1,1\xe2\x80\xb2-binaphthyl-2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-diylhydrogen phosphate). From NMR spectroscopic investigations 1H and 15N chemical shifts, a Steiner\xe2\x80\x93Limbach correlation, a deuterium isotope effect as well as quantitative values of 1JNH, 2hJPH and 3hJPN were used to determine atomic distances (rOH, rNH, rNO) and geometry information. Calculations at SCS-MP2/CBS//TPSS-D3/def2-SVP-level of theory provided potential surfaces, atomic distances and angles. In addition, scalar coupling constants were computed at TPSS-D3/IGLO-III. The combined experimental and theoretical data reveal mainly ion pair complexes providing strong hydrogen bonds with an asymmetric single well potential. The geometries of the hydrogen bonds are not affected by varying the steric or electronic properties of the aromatic imines. Hence, the strong hydrogen bond reduces the degree of freedom of the substrate and acts as a structural anchor in the (R)-TRIP imine complex."
"While DNA is mostly a primary carrier of genetic information and displays a regular duplex structure, RNA can form very complicated and conserved 3D structures displaying a large variety of functions, such as being an intermediary carrier of the genetic information, translating such information into the protein machinery of the cell, or even acting as a chemical catalyst. At the base of such functional diversity is the subtle balance between different backbone, nucleobase, and ribose conformations, finely regulated by the combination of hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions. Although an apparently simple chemical modification, the presence of the 2\xe2\x80\xb2OH in RNA has a profound effect in the ribonucleotide conformational balance, adding an extra layer of complexity to the interactions network in RNA. In the present work, we have combined database analysis with extensive molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics, and hybrid QM/MM simulations to provide direct evidence on the dramatic impact of the 2\xe2\x80\xb2OH conformation on sugar puckering. Calculations provide evidence that proteins can modulate the 2\xe2\x80\xb2OH conformation to drive sugar repuckering, leading then to the formation of bioactive conformations. In summary, the 2\xe2\x80\xb2OH group seems to be a primary molecular switch contributing to specific protein\xe2\x80\x93RNA recognition."
"We report that K2Bi8Se13 exhibits multiple conduction bands that lie close in energy and can be activated through doping, leading to a highly enhanced Seebeck coefficient and a high power factor with elevated temperature. Meanwhile, the large unit cell, complex low symmetry crystal structure, and nondirectional bonding lead to the very low lattice thermal conductivity of K2Bi8Se13, ranging between 0.42 and 0.20 W m\xe2\x80\x931 K\xe2\x80\x931 in the temperature interval 300\xe2\x80\x93873 K. Experimentally, we further support the low thermal conductivity of K2Bi8Se13 using phonon velocity measurements; the results show a low average phonon velocity (1605 ms\xe2\x80\x931), small Young\xe2\x80\x99s modulus (37.1 GPa), large Gr\xc3\xbcneisen parameter (1.71), and low Debye temperature (154 K). A detailed investigation of the microstructure and defects was carried out using electron diffraction and transmission microscopy which reveal the presence of a K2.5Bi8.5Se14 minor phase intergrown along the side of the K2Bi8Se13 phase. The combination of enhanced power factor and low thermal conductivity results in a high ZT value of \xe2\x88\xbc1.3 at 873 K in electron doped K2Bi8Se13 material."
"Artificial nanochannels, inheriting smart gating functions of biological ion channels, promote the development of artificial functional nanofluidic devices for high-performance biosensing and electricity generation. However, gating states of the artificial nanochannels have been mainly realized through chemical modification of the channels with responsive molecules, and their gating states cannot be further regulated once the nanochannel is modified. In this work, we employed a new supramolecular layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly method to achieve reversible and adjustable multiple gating features in nanofluidic diodes. Initially, a self-assembly precursor was modified into a single conical nanochannel, then host molecule-cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and guest molecule, a naphthalene derivative, were self-assembled onto the precursor through an LbL method driven by host-enhanced \xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x93\xcf\x80 interaction, forming supramolecular monolayer or multilayers on the inner surface of the channel. These self-assemblies with different layer numbers possessed remarkable charge effects and steric effects, exhibiting a capability to regulate the surface charge density and polarity, the effective diameter, and the geometric asymmetry of the single nanochannel, realizing reversible gating of the single nanochannel among multiple rectification and ion-conduction states. As an example of self-assembly of supramolecular networks in nanoconfinements, this work provides a new approach for enhancing functionalities of artificial nanochannels by LbL supramolecular self-assemblies. Meanwhile, since the host molecule, CB[8], used in this work can interact with different kinds of biomolecules and stimuli-responsive chemical species, this work can be further extended to build a novel stable multiple-state research platform for a variety of uses such as sensing and controllable release."
"Reported here is a new theranostic agent, 1, which consists of a Gd3+-texaphyrin core conjugated to a doxorubicin prodrug via a disulfide bond. Conjugate 1 was designed to undergo cleavage in the presence of glutathione (GSH), a species typically upregulated in cancer cells. As prepared, conjugate 1 displays no appreciable fluorescence. However, when exposed to excess GSH an increase in the fluorescence intensity at 592 nm is observed that is ascribed to release of free doxorubicin. To improve the solubility and enhance the tumor targeting of 1, it was loaded into folate-receptor-targeted liposomes to produce FL-1 (for folate liposome loaded with 1). As inferred from both fluorescence turn on studies and independent HPLC analyses, FL-1 was found to undergo selective uptake and cleavage to release free Dox in the KB and CT26 cell lines, which express folate receptors on the cell surface, relative to the HepG2 and NIH3T3 cell lines, which show low expression of those receptors. FL-1 was found to produce a greater antiproliferative effect in the case of the KB and CT26 cell lines as compared to that in the HepG2 and NIH3T3 cell lines. FL-1 was also found to provide enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in vivo under conditions of T1 contrast in the early stage of metastatic cancer progression. Finally, time-dependent tumor regrowth studies involving both subcutaneous and metastatic liver cancer mouse models revealed that FL-1 is capable of reducing the tumor burden in vivo."
"We report herein the design, synthesis, and characterization of a two-segment fluorogenic analogue of vitamin\xc2\xa0K, B-VKQ, prepared by coupling vitamin\xc2\xa0K3, also known as menadione (a quinone redox center), to a boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) fluorophore (a lipophilic reporter segment). Oxidation\xe2\x80\x93reduction reactions, spectroelectrochemical studies, and enzymatic assays conducted in the presence of DT-diaphorase illustrate that the new probe shows reversible redox behavior on par with that of vitamin\xc2\xa0K, provides a high-sensitivity fluorescence signal, and is compatible with biological conditions, opening the door to monitor remotely (i.e., via imaging) redox processes in real time. In its oxidized form, B-VKQ is non-emissive, while upon reduction to the hydroquinone form, B-VKQH2, BODIPY fluorescence is restored, with emission quantum yield values of ca. 0.54 in toluene. Density functional theory studies validate a photoinduced electron transfer intramolecular switching mechanism, active in the non-emissive quinone form and deactivated upon reduction to the emissive dihydroquinone form. Our results highlight the potential of B-VKQ as a fluorogenic probe to study electron transfer and transport in model systems and biological structures with optimal sensitivity and desirable chemical specificity. Use of such a probe may enable a better understanding of the role that vitamin\xc2\xa0K plays in biological redox reactions ubiquitous in key cellular processes, and help elucidate the mechanism and pathological significance of these reactions in biological systems."
"In this paper, we demonstrate how photochemically enhancing the permeability of metal\xe2\x80\x93organic assemblies results in a significant enhancement of the electrochemical activity of metal complexes located within the assembly. The molecular assemblies consist of different layers of redox-active metal complexes ([M(mbpy-py)3][PF6]2; M = Ru or Os) that are separated by redox-inactive spacers consisting of 1,4-bis[2-(4-pyridyl)ethenyl]benzene (BPEB) and PdCl2 of variable thicknesses (0\xe2\x80\x9313.4 nm). UV-irradiation (\xce\xbb = 254 nm) of our assemblies induces a photochemical reaction in the redox-inactive spacer increasing the permeability of the assembly. The observed increase was evident by trapping organic (nBu4NBF4) and inorganic (NiCl2) salts inside the assemblies, and by evaluating the electrochemical response of quinones absorbed inside the molecular assemblies before and after UV irradiation. The increase in permeability is reflected by higher currents and a change in the directionality of electron transfer, i.e., from mono- to bidirectional, between the redox-active metal complexes and the electrode surface. The supramolecular structure of the assemblies dominates the overall electron transfer properties and overrules possible electron transfer mediated by the extensive \xcf\x80-conjugation of its individual organic components."
"A family of isostructural, mononuclear CoII complexes with distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination environments is reported. The degree of distortion as well as the overall symmetry of the molecules varies among the members of the series. Different experimental procedures resulted in the isolation of solvomorphs (pseudopolymorphs with different solvent content) for some of the family members. Importantly, their disparate packing arrangements lead to very different dynamic magnetic behavior. The results of magnetostructural correlations and ab initio calculations reveal that the deciding factor for SMM behavior is not the degree of distortion which, a priori, would be expected to be the case, but rather the interactions between neighboring molecules in the solid state."
"High-resolution slow photoelectron velocity-map imaging spectra of cryogenically cooled X\xcc\x832B2 H2CC\xe2\x80\x93 and D2CC\xe2\x80\x93 in the region of the vinylidene triplet excited states are reported. Three electronic bands are observed and, with the assistance of electronic structure calculations and quantum dynamics on ab initio-based near-equilibrium potential energy surfaces, are assigned as detachment to the  3B2 (T1), b\xcc\x83 3A2 (T2), and \xc3\x83 1A2 (S1) excited states of neutral vinylidene. This work provides the first experimental observation of the \xc3\x83 singlet excited state of H2CC. While regular vibrational structure is observed for the \xc3\xa3 and \xc3\x83 electronic bands, a number of irregular features are resolved in the vicinity of the b\xcc\x83 band vibrational origin. High-level ab initio calculations suggest that this anomalous structure arises from a conical intersection between the \xc3\xa3 and b\xcc\x83 triplet states near the b\xcc\x83 state minimum, which strongly perturbs the vibrational levels in the two electronic states through nonadiabatic coupling. Using the adiabatic electron affinity of H2CC previously measured to be 0.490(6) eV by Ervin and co-workers [J. Chem. Phys. 1989, 91, 5974], term energies for the excited neutral states of H2CC are found to be T0(\xc3\xa3 3B2) = 2.064(6), T0(b\xcc\x83 3A2) = 2.738(6), and T0(\xc3\x83 1A2) = 2.991(6) eV."
"Organic photodetectors (OPDs) are attractive for their high optical absorption coefficient, broad wavelength tunability, and compatibility with lightweight and flexible devices. Here we describe a new molecular design that enables high performance organic photodetectors. We use a rigid, conjugated macrocycle as the electron acceptor in devices to obtain high photocurrent and low dark current. We make a direct comparison between the devices made with the macrocyclic acceptor and an acyclic control molecule; we find that the superior performance of the macrocycle originates from its rigid, conjugated, and cyclic structure. The macrocycle\xe2\x80\x99s rigid structure reduces the number of charged defects originating from deformed sp2 carbons and covalent defects from photo/thermoactivation. With this molecular design, we are able to suppress dark current density while retaining high responsivity in an ultrasensitive nonfullerene OPD. Importantly, we achieve a detectivity of \xe2\x88\xbc1014 Jones at near zero bias voltage. This is without the need for extra carrier blocking layers commonly employed in fullerene-based devices. Our devices are comparable to the best fullerene-based photodetectors, and the sensitivity at low working voltages (<0.1 V) is a record for nonfullerene OPDs."
"We present a general strategy to synthesize metastable layered materials via topochemical deintercalation of thermodynamically stable phases. Through kinetic control of the deintercalation reaction, we have prepared two hypothesized metastable compounds, CoSe and CoS, with the anti-PbO type structure from the starting compounds KCo2Se2 and KCo2S2, respectively. Thermal stability, crystal structure from X-ray and neutron diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and electrical resistivity are studied for these new layered chalcogenides; both CoSe and CoS are found to be weak itinerant ferromagnets with Curie temperatures close to 10 K. Due to the weak van der Waals forces between the layers, CoSe is found to be a suitable host for further intercalation of guest species such as Li-ethylenediamine. From first-principles calculations, we explain why the Co chalcogenides are ferromagnets instead of superconductors as in their iron analogues. Bonding analysis of the calculated electronic density of states both explains their phase stability and predicts the limits of our deintercalation technique. Our results have broad implications for the rational design of new two-dimensional building blocks for functional materials."
"Despite the great interest in artificial ion channel design, only a small number of channel-forming molecules are currently available for addressing challenging problems, particularly in the biological systems. Recent advances in chloride-mediated cell death, aided by synthetic ion carriers, encouraged us to develop chloride selective supramolecular ion channels. The present work describes vicinal diols, tethered to a rigid 1,3-diethynylbenzene core, as pivotal moieties for the barrel-rosette ion channel formation, and the activity of such channels was tuned by controlling the lipophilicity of designed monomers. Selective transport of chloride ions via an antiport mechanism and channel formation in the lipid bilayer membranes were confirmed for the most active molecule. A theoretical model of the supramolecular barrel-rosette, favored by a network of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, has been proposed. The artificial ion-channel-mediated transport of chloride into cells and subsequent disruption of cellular ionic homeostasis were evident. Perturbation of chloride homeostasis in cells instigates cell death by inducing the caspase-mediated intrinsic pathway of apoptosis."
"Lasso peptides are a class of bioactive ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), with a threaded knot structure that is formed by an isopeptide bond attaching the N-terminus of the peptide to a side chain carboxylate. Some lasso peptide biosynthetic clusters harbor an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes the isopeptide bond to yield the linear peptide. We describe here the 2.4 \xc3\x85 resolution structure of a lasso peptide isopeptidase revealing a topologically novel didomain architecture consisting of an open \xce\xb2-propeller appended to an \xce\xb1/\xce\xb2 hydrolase domain. The 2.2 \xc3\x85 resolution cocrystal structure of an inactive variant in complex with a lasso peptide reveals deformation of the substrate, and reorganization of the enzyme active site, which exposes and orients the isopeptide bond for hydrolysis. Structure-based mutational analysis reveals how this enzyme recognizes the lasso peptide substrate by shape complementarity rather than through sequence specificity. The isopeptidase gene can be used to facilitate genome mining, as a network-based mining strategy queried with this sequence identified 87 putative lasso peptide biosynthetic clusters, 65 of which have not been previously described. Lastly, we validate this mining approach by heterologous expression of two clusters encoded within the genome of Asticcaucalis benevestitus, and demonstrate that both clusters produce lasso peptides."
"The reactions of the open-cage fullerene, MMK-9, with an open 12-membered ring on its surface and silver(I) salts have been examined. The structure of MMK-9 itself has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. MMK-9 reacts with silver trifluoroacetate in air to form the dimer, {MMK-9(OCH3)5Ag(AgO2CCF3)}2. Remarkably, five MeO groups have added to the surface of the open cage in a pattern that surrounds a pentagon immediately adjacent to the opening in the cage. Dioxygen has been implicated as the oxidant in this unusual addition of five groups to the open cage. Two silver ions connected to each other by a short argentophillic interaction reside at the core of the centrosymmetric dimer. The reaction of silver nitrate with MMK-9 yields the crystalline polymer, [{MMK-9(OCH3)5Ag(AgOCH3)}2\xc2\xb7H2O]n. This polymer consists of dimeric {MMK-9(OCH3)5Ag}2 units that are connected into strands through silver ions, which are chelated by the amine functions of one open cage and bound in \xce\xb72-fashion to a pair of carbon atoms on an adjacent open cage."
"Deoxygenative coupling of CO to value-added C\xe2\x89\xa52 products is challenging and mechanistically poorly understood. Herein, we report a mechanistic investigation into the reductive coupling of CO, which provides new fundamental insights into a multielectron bond-breaking and bond-making transformation. In our studies, the formation of a bis(siloxycarbyne) complex precedes C\xe2\x80\x93O bond cleavage. At \xe2\x88\x9278 \xc2\xb0C, over days, C\xe2\x80\x93C coupling occurs without C\xe2\x80\x93O cleavage. However, upon warming to 0 \xc2\xb0C, C\xe2\x80\x93O cleavage is observed from this bis(siloxycarbyne) complex. A siloxycarbyne/CO species undergoes C\xe2\x80\x93O bond cleavage at lower temperatures, indicating that monosilylation, and a more electron-rich Mo center, favors deoxygenative pathways. From the bis(siloxycarbyne), isotopic labeling experiments and kinetics are consistent with a mechanism involving unimolecular silyl loss or C\xe2\x80\x93O cleavage as rate-determining steps toward carbide formation. Reduction of Mo(IV) CO adducts of carbide and silylcarbyne species allowed for the spectroscopic detection of reduced silylcarbyne/CO and mixed silylcarbyne/siloxycarbyne complexes, respectively. Upon warming, both of these silylcarbynes undergo C\xe2\x80\x93C bond formation, releasing silylated C2O1 fragments and demonstrating that the multiple bonded terminal Mo\xe2\x89\xa1C moiety is an intermediate on the path to deoxygenated, C\xe2\x80\x93C coupled products. The electronic structures of Mo carbide and carbyne species were investigated quantum mechanically. Overall, the present studies establish the elementary reactions steps by which CO is cleaved and coupled at a single metal site."
"We report on the fabrication of a siloxane-encapsulated quantum dot (QD) film (QD-silox film), which exhibits stable emission intensity for over 1 month even at elevated temperature and humidity. QD-silox films are solidified via free radical addition reaction between oligosiloxane resin and ligand molecules on QDs. We prepare the QD-oligosiloxane resin by sol\xe2\x80\x93gel condensation reaction of silane precursors with QDs blended in the precursor solution, forgoing ligand-exchange of QDs. The resulting QD-oligosiloxane resin remains optically clear after 40 days of storage, in contrast to other QD-containing resins which turn turbid and ultimately form sediments. QDs also disperse uniformly in the QD-silox film, whose photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) remains nearly unaltered under harsh conditions; for example, 85 \xc2\xb0C/5% relative humidity (RH), 85 \xc2\xb0C/85% RH, strongly acidic, and strongly basic environments for 40 days. The QD-silox film appears to remain equally emissive even after being immersed into boiling water (100 \xc2\xb0C). Interestingly, the PL QY of the QD-silox film noticeably increases when the film is exposed to a moist environment, which opens a new, facile avenue to curing dimmed QD-containing films. Given its excellent stability, we envision that the QD-silox film is best suited in display applications, particularly as a PL-type down-conversion layer."
"Heterocyclic skeletons play major roles in pharmaceuticals and biological processes. Cycloaddition reactions are most suitable synthetic tools to efficiently construct chemically diverse sets of heterocycles with great structural complexity owing to the simultaneous or sequential formation of two or more bonds, often with a high degree of selectivity. Herein, we report an unprecedented formal cycloaddition of N-Boc-N-hydroxy amido sulfones as the nitrone precursors with terminal-hydroxy \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated carbonyls in the presence of Song\xe2\x80\x99s chiral oligoethylene glycol as a cation-binding catalyst and KF as a base to afford a wide range of highly enantio- and diastereo-enriched six-membered dioxazinane and seven-membered dioxazepane heterocycles. In this process, nitrones as well as terminal-hydroxy \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated carbonyls serve as \xe2\x80\x9camphiphilic\xe2\x80\x9d building units, and the reaction proceeds through a tandem pathway sequence of oxa-Mannich reaction/oxa-Michael reaction/tautomerization/protonation. The cation-binding catalysis in a densely confined chiral space in situ formed by the incorporation of potassium salt is the key to this successful catalysis. This strategy opens a new pathway for the asymmetric synthesis of diverse heterocyclic skeletons of great complexity."
"The manganese-nitronyl-nitroxide two-dimensional coordination polymer {[Mn2(NITIm)3]ClO4}n (1) (NITImH = 2-(2-imidazolyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-3-oxide-1-oxyl) undergoes an unusual hysteretic thermo-induced valence tautomeric transition near room temperature, during which the manganese(II) ions are oxidized to manganese(III) and two of the three deprotonated radicals (NITIm\xe2\x80\x93) are reduced to their diamagnetic aminoxyl form (denoted NITRed2\xe2\x80\x93). Upon cooling, the high-temperature species {[MnII2(NITIm)3]ClO4}n (1HT) turns into the low-temperature species {[MnIII2(NITRed)2(NITIm)]ClO4}n (1LT) around 274 K, while on heating the process is reversed at about 287 K. This valence tautomeric phenomenon is supported by temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), crystal structure determination, UV\xe2\x80\x93vis absorption, X-ray absorption (XAS), and emission (XES) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies in the solid state."
"Narrowly dispersed, silica-supported Cu nanoparticles (ca. 2 nm) prepared via surface organometallic chemistry from a mesityl complex [Cu5Mes5] are highly active for the hydrogenation of a broad range of alkynes. High-throughput experimentation allows for identifying the optimal ligand and reaction conditions to turn these supported Cu nanoparticles into highly chemo- and stereoselective catalysts for the preparation of Z-olefins (overall, 23 examples). For instance, PCy3-modified Cu nanoparticles semihydrogenate 1-phenyl-1-propyne to cis-\xce\xb2-methylstyrene (20 bar H2, 40 \xc2\xb0C) with turnover number and turnover frequency of ca. 540 and 1.9 min\xe2\x80\x931, respectively, and with 94% selectivity at full conversion."
"Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) regulate energy expenditure in living cells by inducing proton leakage across the mitochondrial inner membrane, thereby uncoupling adenosine diphosphate phosphorylation from nutrient oxidation. The proton transport activity of UCP1 and UCP2 requires activation by fatty acids. We report here the first examples of synthetic neutral anion receptors performing this biologically important fatty acid-activated function in phospholipid bilayers. We have shown that a tripodal thiourea possesses poor H+/OH\xe2\x80\x93 transport activity without fatty acids, but in the presence of long-chain fatty acids is \xe2\x80\x9cswitched on\xe2\x80\x9d as a proton transporter with an activity close to that of a commonly used protonophore. The fatty acid-enhanced proton transport was also observed for other hydrogen and halogen bond-based synthetic anion transporters. We propose that these compounds induce proton permeability by catalyzing transbilayer movement (\xe2\x80\x9cflip-flop\xe2\x80\x9d) of anionic forms of fatty acids, so allowing the fatty acids to complete a proton transport cycle. Several lines of evidence have been provided to support such a fatty acid cycling mechanism. Our findings open up new applications of anion receptor chemistry and provide important clues for understanding biological activities of synthetic anion transporters and potentially the uncoupling mechanism of naturally occurring membrane proteins."
Fluoride has been overlooked as a target in the development of synthetic anion transporters despite natural fluoride transport channels being recently discovered. In this paper we report the direct measurement of fluoride transport across lipid bilayers facilitated by a series of strapped calix[4]pyrroles and show that these compounds facilitate transport via an electrogenic mechanism (determined using valinomycin and monensin coupled transport assays and an additional osmotic response assay). An HPTS transport assay was used to quantify this electrogenic process and assess the interference of naturally occurring fatty acids with the transport process and Cl\xe2\x80\x93 over H+/OH\xe2\x80\x93 transport selectivity.
"We compared the chemical reactivity of D2d(23)-C84 and that of Sc2C2@D2d(23)-C84, both having the same carbon cage geometry, in the photolysis of 2-adamantane-2,3\xe2\x80\xb2-[3H]-diazirine, to clarify metal-atom doping effects on the chemical reactivity of the carbon cage. Experimental and computational studies have revealed that the chemical reactivity of the D2d(23)-C84 carbon cage is altered drastically by endohedral Sc2C2 doping. The reaction of empty D2d(23)-C84 with the diazirine under photoirradiation yields two adamantylidene (Ad) adducts. NMR spectroscopic studies revealed that the major Ad monoadduct (C84(Ad)-A) has a fulleroid structure and that the minor Ad monoadduct (C84(Ad)-B) has a methanofullerene structure. The latter was also characterized using X-ray crystallography. C84(Ad)-A is stable under photoirradiation, but it interconverted to C84(Ad)-B by heating at 80 \xc2\xb0C. In contrast, the reaction of endohedral Sc2C2@D2d(23)-C84 with diazirine under photoirradiation affords four Ad monoadducts (Sc2C2@C84(Ad)-A, Sc2C2@C84(Ad)-B, Sc2C2@C84(Ad)-C, and Sc2C2@C84(Ad)-D). The structure of Sc2C2@C84(Ad)-C was characterized using X-ray crystallography. Thermal interconversion of Sc2C2@C84(Ad)-A and Sc2C2@C84(Ad)-B to Sc2C2@C84(Ad)-C was also observed. The reaction mechanisms of the Ad addition and thermal interconversion were elucidated from theoretical calculations. Calculation results suggest that C84(Ad)-B and Sc2C2@C84(Ad)-C are thermodynamically favorable products. Their different chemical reactivities derive from Sc2C2 doping, which raises the HOMO and LUMO levels of the D2d(23)-C84 carbon cage."
"High-power sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with long-term cycling attract increasing attention for large-scale energy storage. However, traditional SIBs toward practical applications still suffer from low rate capability and poor cycle induced by pulverization and amorphorization of anodes at high rate (over 5 C) during the fast ion insertion/extraction process. The present work demonstrates a robust strategy for a variety of (Sb\xe2\x80\x93C, Bi\xe2\x80\x93C, Sn\xe2\x80\x93C, Ge\xe2\x80\x93C, Sb\xe2\x80\x93Bi\xe2\x80\x93C) freestanding metal\xe2\x80\x93carbon framework thin films via a space-confined superassembly (SCSA) strategy. The sodium-ion battery employing the Sb\xe2\x80\x93C framework exhibits an unprecedented performance with a high specific capacity of 246 mAh g\xe2\x80\x931, long life cycle (5000 cycles), and superb capacity retention (almost 100%) at a high rate of 7.5 C (3.51A g\xe2\x80\x931). Further investigation indicates that the unique framework structure enables unusual reversible crystalline-phase transformation, guaranteeing the fast and long-cyclability sodium storage. This study may open an avenue to developing long-cycle-life and high-power SIBs for practical energy applications."
"Recent reports have shown that different DNA sequences can mediate the control of shapes and surface properties of nanoparticles. However, all previous studies have involved only monometallic particles, most of which were gold nanoparticles. Controlling the shape of bimetallic nanoparticles is more challenging, and there is little research into the use of DNA-based ligands for their morphological control. We report the DNA-templated synthesis of Pd\xe2\x80\x93Au bimetallic nanoparticles starting from palladium nanocube seeds. The presence of different homo-oligomer DNA sequences containing 10 deoxy-ribonucleotides of thymine, adenine, cytosine, or guanine results in the growth of four distinct morphologies. Through detailed kinetic studies by absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we have determined the role of DNA in controlling Pd\xe2\x80\x93Au nanoparticle growth morphologies. One major function of DNA is affecting various properties of the incoming metal atoms, including their diffusion and deposition on the Pd nanocube seed. Interestingly, nanoparticle growth in the presence of A10 follows an aggregative growth mechanism that is unique when compared to the other base oligomers. These findings demonstrate that DNA can allow for programmable control of bimetallic nanoparticle morphologies, resulting in more complex hybrid materials with different plasmonic properties. The capability to finely tune multimetallic nanoparticle morphology stems from the versatile structure that is unique to DNA in comparison to conventionally used capping agents in colloidal nanomaterial synthesis."
"This paper describes the design and synthesis of a conjugate (Q7R) comprising the synthetic host cucurbit[7]uril (Q7) linked to the fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine (TMR), and the characterization of its optical and guest-binding properties as well as its cellular uptake. Q7R was synthesized in two steps from monofunctionalized azidobutyl-Q7 and NHS-activated TMR. The fluorescence of Q7R is quenched upon guest binding, and this observable was used to determine equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values. Unexpectedly, the Kd values for guests binding to Q7R and to unmodified Q7 were essentially identical. Therefore, Q7R can directly report binding to Q7 without an energetic penalty due to the conjugated fluorophore. This result demonstrates a potentially general strategy for the design of single-component host\xe2\x80\x93indicator conjugates that respond sensitively to analytes without perturbing the binding properties of the host. The unique properties of Q7R enabled measurement of Kd values across 3 orders of magnitude and at concentrations as low as 0.7 nM. This result is particularly relevant given the unmatched range of guests and binding affinities demonstrated for Q7. Confocal fluorescence microscopy of live and fixed HT22 neurons revealed the cellular uptake of Q7R and its punctate localization in the cytoplasm. Q7R did not alter cell growth at concentrations up to 2.2 \xce\xbcM over 4 days. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of Q7R as a direct sensor for guest binding and as a cell-permeable compound for imaging applications."
"Novel chiral iron phosphate complexes were prepared as catalysts for asymmetric oxidative coupling reactions. These catalysts were applied for the synthesis of enantio-enriched C1- and C2-symmetric BINOLs, in which the 3 and 3\xe2\x80\xb2 positions are available for chemical modifications. It was proposed that the reaction takes place via an oxidative radical-anion coupling mechanism. A destructive BINOL racemization that competes with the enantioselective oxidative coupling of 2-naphthols was revealed, thereby offering new insights into this highly important reaction."
"Axially chiral 1,1\xe2\x80\xb2-spirobiindane-7,7\xe2\x80\xb2-diol (SPINOL) is the most fundamental and important privileged structure from which other chiral ligands containing a 1,1\xe2\x80\xb2-spirobiindane backbone are synthesized. Driven by the development of enantioselective syntheses of axially chiral SPINOL derivatives, we have successfully developed the first phosphoric acid-catalyzed asymmetric approach. This approach is highly convergent and functional group tolerant, efficiently providing SPINOLs in good yield with excellent enantioselectivity, thus delivering a practical and straightforward access to this privileged structure. It should be emphasized that the catalyst loading could be decreased to only 0.1 mol% for the preparative-scale synthesis. Furthermore, 4,4\xe2\x80\xb2-dimethyl-SPINOL-phosphoric acid was synthesized and applied to catalyze the model reaction for synthesis of enantioenriched SPINOL derivatives."
A new report sheds lights on the mechanism underlying the rupture of silicon\xe2\x80\x93silicon bonds in single molecule junctions.
"We first report the GaAs/ZnSe and InxGa1\xe2\x80\x93xAs/ZnSe core/shell structured colloidal quantum dots (CQDs). GaAs based CQD, which are hard to obtain by the chemical synthetic method, can be prepared successfully using the acetylacetonate complex of indium and gallium as cationic precursors. We control the indium contents, and the photoluminescence emission is tuned from orange to deep red. In0.2Ga0.8As/ZnSe core/shell QDs show the best quantum yield of 25.6%. A ZnSe outer shell protects the core and improves quantum yield, and it shows a large red shift owing to the quasi-type-I band structure."
"We report on the spontaneous polarization transfer from dynamically hyperpolarized 1H to 13C during magic-angle spinning dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) at temperatures around 100 K. The transfer is mediated by 1H\xe2\x80\x9313C cross-relaxation within methyl groups due to reorientation dynamics, and results in an inverted 13C NMR signal of enhanced amplitude. Further spreading of transferred polarization can then occur via 13C\xe2\x80\x9313C spin-diffusion. The resulting process is equal to the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) where typically continuous saturation of 1H by radio frequency irradiation is employed. Here, hyperpolarization by irradiation with microwaves in the presence of typical bis-nitroxide polarizing agents is utilized for steady-state displacement of 1H polarization from thermal equilibrium and perpetual spin-lattice relaxation. An effective 13C enhancement factor of up to \xe2\x88\x9215 has been measured. Presence of Gd(III) furthermore amplifies the effect likely by accelerated relaxation of 1H. We provide experimental evidence for the proposed mechanism and show that DNP-induced cross-relaxation is a robust feature within proteins and single amino acids and discuss potential applications."
"Despite the high theoretical capacity of the sodium\xe2\x80\x93sulfur battery, its application is seriously restrained by the challenges due to its low sulfur electroactivity and accelerated shuttle effect, which lead to low accessible capacity and fast decay. Herein, an elaborate carbon framework, interconnected mesoporous hollow carbon nanospheres, is reported as an effective sulfur host to achieve excellent electrochemical performance. Based on in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, the mechanism of the room temperature Na/S battery is proposed to be reversible reactions between S8 and Na2S4, corresponding to a theoretical capacity of 418 mAh g\xe2\x80\x931. The cell is capable of achieving high capacity retention of \xe2\x88\xbc88.8% over 200 cycles, and superior rate capability with reversible capacity of \xe2\x88\xbc390 and 127 mAh g\xe2\x80\x931 at 0.1 and 5 A g\xe2\x80\x931, respectively."
"A variety of acyl protected phenols AcOAr participate in sp3 C-H etherification of substrates R-H to give alkyl aryl ethers R-OAr employing tBuOOtBu as oxidant with copper(I) \xce\xb2-diketiminato catalysts [CuI]. Although 1\xc2\xb0, 2\xc2\xb0, and 3\xc2\xb0 C-H bonds may be functionalized, selectivity studies reveal a preference for the construction of hindered, 3\xc2\xb0 C-OAr bonds. Mechanistic studies indicate that \xce\xb2-diketiminato copper(II) phenolates [CuII]-OAr play a key role in this C-O bond forming reaction, formed via transesterification of AcOAr with [CuII]-OtBu intermediates generated upon reaction of [CuI] with tBuOOtBu."
"Migratory birds use the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field as a source of navigational information. This light-dependent magnetic compass is thought to be mediated by cryptochrome proteins in the retina. Upon light activation, electron transfer between the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor and tryptophan residues leads to the formation of a spin-correlated radical pair, whose subsequent fate is sensitive to external magnetic fields. To learn more about the functional requirements of this complex chemical compass, we have created a family of simplified, adaptable proteins\xe2\x80\x94maquettes\xe2\x80\x94that contain a single tryptophan residue at different distances from a covalently bound flavin. Despite the complete absence of structural resemblance to the native cryptochrome fold or sequence, the maquettes exhibit a strong magnetic field effect that rivals those observed in the natural proteins in vitro. These novel maquette designs offer unprecedented flexibility to explore the basic requirements for magnetic sensing in a protein environment."
"Covalently linked diubiquitin (diUbq) is known to adopt specific interfacial interactions owing to steric hindrance induced by the covalent tether. K48-linked diUbq preferentially forms hydrophobic interfacial interactions between the two I44 faces under physiological conditions, whereas K63-linked diUbq preferentially forms electrostatic interfacial interactions. Here, we show using collision-induced unfolding ion mobility-mass spectrometry that the recently reported noncovalent dimer of ubiquitin exhibits structural preferences and interfacial interactions that are most similar to that of K48-linked diUbq."
"A spin crossover phenomena is observed in an anionic (Bu4N+){Co(Ph3P)}2(\xce\xbc2-Cl\xe2\x80\x93)(\xce\xbc2-\xce\xb72,\xce\xb72-C60)2\xc2\xb72C6H14 (1) complex in which two cobalt atoms bridge two fullerene molecules to form a dimer. The dimer has a triplet ground state with two weakly coupling Co0 atoms (S = 1/2). The spin transition realized above 150 K is accompanied by a cobalt-to-fullerene charge transfer that forms a quintet excited state with a high spin CoI (S = 1) and C60\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x93 (S = 1/2)."
"Biological entities, such as DNA bases or proteins, possess numerous tautomers and isomers that lie close in energy, making the experimental characterization of a unique tautomer challenging. We apply VUV synchrotron-based experiments combined with state-of-the-art ab initio methodology to determine the adiabatic ionization energies (AIEs) of specific gas-phase cytosine tautomers produced in a molecular beam. The structures and energetics of neutral and cationic cytosine tautomers were determined using explicitly correlated methods. The experimental spectra correspond to well-resolved bands that are attributable to the specific contributions of five neutral tautomers of cytosine prior to ionization. Their AIEs are experimentally determined for the first time with an accuracy of 0.003 eV. This study also serves as an important showcase for other biological entities presenting a dense pattern of isomeric and tautomeric forms in their spectra that can be investigated to understand the charge redistribution in these species upon ionization."
"A general strategy through the use of direct azidation of alcohols allowed the sequence control of macromers via both the iterative sequential growth and iterative exponential growth methods. The chemistry was highly efficient in building polymers from a sequence of compositionally different macromers tethered together in close proximity. Using the DPPA/DBU method for near quantitative azidation of the benzyl alcohol moiety, sequence controlled polymers were made via a direct and one-step procedure for CuAAC activation. With four different macromers, spherical miktoarm star-like polymers of 50\xe2\x80\xaf000 molecular weight were prepared with a low dispersity, and the polymer coil size depended on the type of added macromer. Polymers made via the iterative methods opens the way for the design of advanced materials with predictable properties."
"Biochemical diversity of venom extracts often occurs within a small number of shared protein families. Developing a sequestrant capable of broad-spectrum neutralization across various protein isoforms within these protein families is a necessary step in creating broad-spectrum antivenom. Using directed synthetic evolution to optimize a nanoparticle (NP) formulation capable of sequestering and neutralizing venomous phospholipase A2 (PLA2), we demonstrate that broad-spectrum neutralization and sequestration of venomous biomacromolecules is possible via a single optimized NP formulation. Furthermore, this optimized NP showed selectivity for venomous PLA2 over abundant serum proteins, was not cytotoxic, and showed substantially long dissociation rates from PLA2. These findings suggest that it may show efficacy as an in vivo venom sequestrant and may serve as a generalized lipid-mediated toxin sequestrant."
"An unexpected 5000% increase in growth efficiency and high (95%) single-wall selectivity synthesis of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was shown from Fe catalysts supported on a sputtered MgO underlayer from a simple underlayer treatment, i.e., annealing treatment. In this way, millimeter-scale single-wall carbon nanotube \xe2\x80\x9cforests\xe2\x80\x9d could be synthesized in a 10 min time, which has never been previously reported for MgO catalyst underlayer or any underlayer besides Al2O3. This level of efficiency and characterized SWCNT properties were similar to those grown using Al2O3 underlayers. Spectroscopic and microscopic analyses revealed that the treatment improved stability of the catalyst nanoparticle array by the suppressing catalyst subsurface diffusion and retaining the metallic state of the surface Fe atoms. Taken together, these results reveal a new route in achieving highly efficient SWCNT synthesis."
"Two-dimensional (2D) layered hybrid perovskites of (RNH3)2PbX4 (R is an alkyl and X is a halide) have been recently synthesized and exhibited rich optical properties including fluorescence and exciton effects. However, few studies on transport and optoelectronic measurements of individual 2D perovskite crystals have been reported, presumably owing to the instability issue during electronic device fabrications. Here we report the first photodetector based on individual 2D (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4 perovskite crystals, built with the protection and top contact of graphene film. Both a high responsivity (\xe2\x88\xbc2100 A/W) and extremely low dark current (\xe2\x88\xbc10\xe2\x80\x9310 A) are achieved with a design of interdigital graphene electrodes. Our study paves the way to build high-performance optoelectronic devices based on the emerging 2D single-crystal perovskite materials."
"Illicium sesquiterpenes have been the subject of numerous synthetic efforts due to their ornate and highly oxidized structures as well as significant biological activities. Herein we report the first chemical synthesis of (+)-pseudoanisatin from the abundant feedstock chemical cedrol (\xe2\x88\xbc$50 USD/kg) in 12 steps using extensive site-selective C(sp3)\xe2\x80\x93H bond functionalization. Significantly, this work represents a novel oxidative strategic template for future approaches to these natural products and their analogs."
"There has been considerable debate on the existence of a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) in the photoactive yellow protein (PYP). The debate was initially triggered by the neutron diffraction study of Yamaguchi et al. ( Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A., 2009, 106, 440\xe2\x88\x92444) who suggested a model in which a neutral Arg52 residue triggers the formation of the LBHB in PYP. Here, we present an alternative model that is consistent within the error margins of the Yamaguchi structure factors. The model explains an increased hydrogen bond length without nuclear quantum effects and for a protonated Arg52. We tested both models by calculations under crystal, solution, and vacuum conditions. Contrary to the common assumption in the field, we found that a single PYP in vacuum does not provide an accurate description of the crystal conditions but instead introduces strong artifacts, which favor a LBHB and a large 1H NMR chemical shift. Our model of the crystal environment was found to stabilize the two Arg52 hydrogen bonds and crystal water positions for the protonated Arg52 residue in free MD simulations and predicted an Arg52 pKa upshift with respect to PYP in solution. The crystal and solution environments resulted in almost identical 1H chemical shifts that agree with NMR solution data. We also calculated the effect of the Arg52 protonation state on the LBHB in 3D nuclear equilibrium density calculations. Only the charged crystal structure in vacuum supports a LBHB if Arg52 is neutral in PYP at the previously reported level of theory ( J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2014, 136, 3542\xe2\x88\x923552). We attribute the anomalies in the interpretation of the neutron data to a shift of the potential minimum, which does not involve nuclear quantum effects and is transferable beyond the Yamaguchi structure."
"MoS2 presents a promising low-cost catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but the understanding about its active sites has remained limited. Here we present an unambiguous study of the catalytic activities of all possible reaction sites of MoS2, including edge sites, sulfur vacancies, and grain boundaries. We demonstrate that, in addition to the well-known catalytically active edge sites, sulfur vacancies provide another major active site for the HER, while the catalytic activity of grain boundaries is much weaker. The intrinsic turnover frequencies (Tafel slopes) of the edge sites, sulfur vacancies, and grain boundaries are estimated to be 7.5 s\xe2\x80\x931 (65\xe2\x80\x9375 mV/dec), 3.2 s\xe2\x80\x931 (65\xe2\x80\x9385 mV/dec), and 0.1 s\xe2\x80\x931 (120\xe2\x80\x93160 mV/dec), respectively. We also demonstrate that the catalytic activity of sulfur vacancies strongly depends on the density of the vacancies and the local crystalline structure in proximity to the vacancies. Unlike edge sites, whose catalytic activity linearly depends on the length, sulfur vacancies show optimal catalytic activities when the vacancy density is in the range of 7\xe2\x80\x9310%, and the number of sulfur vacancies in high crystalline quality MoS2 is higher than that in low crystalline quality MoS2, which may be related with the proximity of different local crystalline structures to the vacancies."
"The starting point of this study of through-space substituent effects on the catalysis of the electrochemical CO2-to-CO conversion by iron(0) tetraphenylporphyrins is the linear free energy correlation between through-structure electronic effects and the iron(I/0) standard potential that we established separately. The introduction of four positively charged trimethylanilinium groups at the para positions of the tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) phenyls results in an important positive deviation from the correlation and a parallel improvement of the catalytic Tafel plot. The assignment of this catalysis boosting effect to the Coulombic interaction of these positive charges with the negative charge borne by the initial Fe0\xe2\x80\x93CO2 adduct is confirmed by the negative deviation observed when the four positive charges are replaced by four negative charges borne by sulfonate groups also installed in the para positions of the TPP phenyls. The climax of this strategy of catalysis boosting by means of Coulombic stabilization of the initial Fe0\xe2\x80\x93CO2 adduct is reached when four positively charged trimethylanilinium groups are introduced at the ortho positions of the TPP phenyls. The addition of a large concentration of a weak acid\xe2\x80\x94phenol\xe2\x80\x94helps by cleaving one of the C\xe2\x80\x93O bonds of CO2. The efficiency of the resulting catalyst is unprecedented, as can be judged by the catalytic Tafel plot benchmarking with all presently available catalysts of the electrochemical CO2-to-CO conversion. The maximal turnover frequency (TOF) is as high as 106 s\xe2\x80\x931 and is reached at an overpotential of only 220 mV; the extrapolated TOF at zero overpotential is larger than 300 s\xe2\x80\x931. This catalyst leads to a highly selective formation of CO (practically 100%) in spite of the presence of a high concentration of phenol, which could have favored H2 evolution. It is also very stable, showing no significant alteration after more than 80 h of electrolysis."
"We herein present a three-in-one nanoplatform for sensing, self-assembly, and cascade catalysis, enabled by cyclodextrin modified gold nanoparticles (CD@AuNPs). Monodisperse AuNPs 15\xe2\x80\x9320 nm in diameter are fabricated in an eco-friendly way by the proposed one-step colloidal synthesis method using CD as both reducing agents and stabilizers. First, the as-prepared AuNPs are employed as not only scaffolds but energy acceptors for turn-on fluorescent sensing based on guest replacement reaction. Then, the macrocyclic supramolecule functionalized AuNPs can be controllably assembled and form well-defined one- and two-dimensional architectures using tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin as mediator. Finally, in addition to conventional host\xe2\x80\x93guest interaction based properties, the CD@AuNPs possess unpredictable catalytic activity and exhibit mimicking properties of both glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase simultaneously. Especially, the cascade reaction (glucose is first catalytically oxidized and generates gluconic acid and H2O2; then the enzymatic H2O2 and preadded TMB (3,3\xe2\x80\xb2,5,5\xe2\x80\xb2-tetramethylbenzidine) are further catalyzed into H2O and oxTMB, respectively) is well-achieved using the AuNPs as the sole catalyst. By employing a joint experimental\xe2\x80\x93theoretical study, we reveal that the unique catalytic properties of the CD@AuNPs probably derive from the special topological structures of CD molecules and the resulting electron transfer effect from the AuNP surface to the appended CD molecules."
"Carbon monoxide is a ubiquitous molecule, a key feedstock and intermediate in chemical processes. Its adsorption and activation, typically carried out on metallic nanoparticles (NPs), are strongly dependent on the particle size. In particular, small NPs, which in principle contain more corner and step-edge atoms, are surprisingly less reactive than larger ones. Hereby, first-principles calculations on explicit Ru NP models (1\xe2\x80\x932 nm) show that both small and large NPs can present step-edge sites (e.g., B5 and B6 sites). However, such sites display strong particle-size-dependent reactivity because of very subtle differences in local chemical bonding. State-of-the-art crystal orbital Hamilton population analysis allows a detailed molecular orbital picture of adsorbed CO on step-edges, which can be classified as flat (\xce\xb71 coordination) and concave (\xce\xb72 coordination) sites. Our analysis shows that the CO \xcf\x80-metal d\xcf\x80 hybrid band responsible for the electron back-donation is better represented by an oxygen lone pair on flat sites, whereas it is delocalized on both C and O atoms on concave sites, increasing the back-bonding on these sites compared to flat step-edges or low-index surface sites. The bonding analysis also rationalizes why CO cleavage is easier on step-edge sites of large NPs compared to small ones irrespective of the site geometry. The lower reactivity of small NPs is due to the smaller extent of the Ru\xe2\x80\x93O interaction in the \xce\xb72 adsorption mode, which destabilizes the \xce\xb72 transition-state structure for CO direct cleavage. Our findings provide a molecular understanding of the reactivity of CO on NPs, which is consistent with the observed particle size effect."
"Early protocells are likely to have arisen from the self-assembly of RNA, peptide, and lipid molecules that were generated and concentrated within geologically favorable environments on the early Earth. The reactivity of these components in a prebiotic environment that supplied sources of chemical energy could have produced additional species with properties favorable to the emergence of protocells. The geochemically plausible activation of amino acids by carbonyl sulfide has been shown to generate short peptides via the formation of cyclic amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides (NCAs). Here, we show that the polymerization of valine-NCA in the presence of fatty acids yields acylated amino acids and peptides via a mixed anhydride intermediate. Notably, N\xce\xb1-oleoylarginine, a product of the reaction between arginine and oleic acid in the presence of valine-NCA, partitions spontaneously into vesicle membranes and mediates the association of RNA with the vesicles. Our results suggest a potential mechanism by which activated amino acids could diversify the chemical functionality of fatty acid membranes and colocalize RNA with vesicles during the formation of early protocells."
"New structural characteristics emerge when solid-state crystals are constructed in lower dimensions. This is exemplified by single-wall carbon nanotubes, which exhibit a degree of freedom in handedness and a multitude of helicities that give rise to three distinct types of electronic structures: metals, quasi-metals, and semiconductors. Here we report the use of intrinsically chiral single-stranded DNA to achieve simultaneous handedness and helicity control for all three types of nanotubes. We apply polymer aqueous two-phase systems to select special DNA-wrapped carbon nanotubes, each of which we argue must have an ordered DNA structure that binds to a nanotube of defined handedness and helicity and resembles a well-folded biomacromolecule with innate stereoselectivity. We have screened over 300 short single-stranded DNA sequences with palindrome symmetry, leading to the selection of more than 20 distinct carbon nanotube structures that have defined helicity and handedness and cover the entire chiral angle range and all three electronic types. The mechanism of handedness selection is illustrated by a DNA sequence that adopts two distinct folds on a pair of (6,5) nanotube enantiomers, rendering them large differences in fluorescence intensity and chemical reactivity. This result establishes a first example of functionally distinguishable left- and right-handed carbon nanotubes. Taken together, our work demonstrates highly efficient enantiomer differentiation by DNA and offers a first comprehensive solution to achieve simultaneous handedness and helicity control for all three electronic types of carbon nanotubes."
"An effective, nontoxic, tumor-specific immunotherapy is the ultimate goal in the battle against cancer, especially the metastatic disease. Checkpoint blockade-based immunotherapies have been shown to be extraordinarily effective but benefit only the minority of patients whose tumors have been pre-infiltrated by T cells. Here, we show that Zn-pyrophosphate (ZnP) nanoparticles loaded with the photosensitizer pyrolipid (ZnP@pyro) can kill tumor cells upon irradiation with light directly by inducing apoptosis and/or necrosis and indirectly by disrupting tumor vasculature and increasing tumor immunogenicity. Furthermore, immunogenic ZnP@pyro photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment sensitizes tumors to checkpoint inhibition mediated by a PD-L1 antibody, not only eradicating the primary 4T1 breast tumor but also significantly preventing metastasis to the lung. The abscopal effects on both 4T1 and TUBO bilateral syngeneic mouse models further demonstrate that ZnP@pyro PDT treatment combined with anti-PD-L1 results in the eradication of light-irradiated primary tumors and the complete inhibition of untreated distant tumors by generating a systemic tumor-specific cytotoxic T cell response. These findings indicate that nanoparticle-mediated PDT can potentiate the systemic efficacy of checkpoint blockade immunotherapies by activating the innate and adaptive immune systems in tumor microenvironment."
"Surface-confined polymerization via Ullmann coupling is a promising route to create one- and two-dimensional covalent \xcf\x80-conjugated structures, including the bottom-up growth of graphene nanoribbons. Understanding the mechanism of the Ullmann reaction is necessary to provide a platform for rationally controlling the formation of these materials. We use fast X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in kinetic measurements of epitaxial surface polymerization of 1,4-dibromobenzene on Cu(110) and devise a kinetic model based on mean field rate equations, involving a transient state. This state is observed in the energy landscapes calculated by nudged elastic band (NEB) within density functional theory (DFT), which assumes as initial and final geometries of the organometallic and polymeric structures those observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The kinetic model accounts for all the salient features observed in the experimental curves extracted from the fast-XPS measurements and enables an enhanced understanding of the polymerization process, which is found to follow a nucleation-and-growth behavior preceded by the formation of a transient state."
"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), formed by reversible condensation of rigid organic building blocks, are crystalline and porous materials of great potential for catalysis and organic electronics. Particularly with a view of organic electronics, achieving a maximum degree of crystallinity and large domain sizes while allowing for a tightly \xcf\x80-stacked topology would be highly desirable. We present a design concept that uses the 3D geometry of the building blocks to generate a lattice of uniquely defined docking sites for the attachment of consecutive layers, thus allowing us to achieve a greatly improved degree of order within a given average number of attachment and detachment cycles during COF growth. Synchronization of the molecular geometry across several hundred nanometers promotes the growth of highly crystalline frameworks with unprecedented domain sizes. Spectroscopic data indicate considerable delocalization of excitations along the \xcf\x80-stacked columns and the feasibility of donor\xe2\x80\x93acceptor excitations across the imine bonds. The frameworks developed in this study can serve as a blueprint for the design of a broad range of tailor-made 2D COFs with extended \xcf\x80-conjugated building blocks for applications in photocatalysis and optoelectronics."
"Platensimycin (PTM) and platencin (PTN) are highly functionalized bacterial diterpenoid natural products that target bacterial and mammalian fatty acid synthases. PTM and PTN feature varying diterpene-derived ketolides that are linked to the same 3-amino-2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid moiety. As a result, PTM is a selective inhibitor for FabF/FabB, while PTN is a dual inhibitor of FabF/FabB and FabH. We previously determined that the PTM cassette, consisting of five genes found in the ptm, but not ptn, gene cluster, partitions the biosynthesis of the PTM and PTN diterpene-derived ketolides. We now report investigation of the PTM cassette through the construction of diterpene production systems in E. coli and genetic manipulation in the PTM\xe2\x80\x93PTN dual overproducer Streptomyces platensis SB12029, revealing two genes, ptmT3 and ptmO5, that are responsible for the biosynthetic divergence between the PTM and PTN diterpene-derived ketolides. PtmT3, a type I diterpene synthase, was determined to be a (16R)-ent-kauran-16-ol synthase, the first of its kind found in bacteria. PtmO5, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, is proposed to catalyze the formation of the characteristic 11S,16S-ether ring found in PTM. Inactivation of ptmO5 in SB12029 afforded the \xce\x94ptmO5 mutant SB12036 that accumulated nine PTM and PTN congeners, seven of which were new, including seven 11-deoxy-16R-hydroxy-PTM congeners. The two fully processed PTM analogues showed antibacterial activities, albeit lower than that of PTM, indicating that the ether ring, or minimally the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group at C-16, is crucial for the activity of PTM."
"Light-driven enzymatic catalysis is enabled by the productive coupling of a protein to a photosensitizer. Photosensitizers used in such hybrid systems are typically costly, toxic, and/or fragile, with limited chemical versatility. Carbon dots (CDs) are low-cost, nanosized light-harvesters that are attractive photosensitizers for biological systems as they are water-soluble, photostable, nontoxic, and their surface chemistry can be easily modified. We demonstrate here that CDs act as excellent light-absorbers in two semibiological photosynthetic systems utilizing either a fumarate reductase (FccA) for the solar-driven hydrogenation of fumarate to succinate or a hydrogenase (H2ase) for reduction of protons to H2. The tunable surface chemistry of the CDs was exploited to synthesize positively charged ammonium-terminated CDs (CD-NHMe2+), which were capable of transferring photoexcited electrons directly to the negatively charged enzymes with high efficiency and stability. Enzyme-based turnover numbers of 6000 mol succinate (mol FccA)\xe2\x88\x921 and 43,000 mol H2 (mol H2ase)\xe2\x88\x921 were reached after 24 h. Negatively charged carboxylate-terminated CDs (CD-CO2\xe2\x80\x93) displayed little or no activity, and the electrostatic interactions at the CD\xe2\x80\x93enzyme interface were determined to be essential to the high photocatalytic activity observed with CD-NHMe2+. The modular surface chemistry of CDs together with their photostability and aqueous solubility make CDs versatile photosensitizers for redox enzymes with great scope for their utilization in photobiocatalysis."
"The factors controlling the reactivities and stereoselectivities in the Diels\xe2\x80\x93Alder reactions of substituted cyclopropenes with butadiene were explored with M06-2X density functional theory. Differences in reactivities result from differences in the hyperconjugative aromaticities and antiaromaticities of the cyclopropenes. When the 3-substituent is a \xcf\x83-donor, the ground state is destabilized, and the reactivity is enhanced. Acceptors have the opposite effect. Electrostatic, secondary orbital, and steric effects are all found to influence stereoselectivities."
"The lateral organization of biological membranes is thought to take place on the nanometer length scale. However, this length scale and the dynamic nature of small lipid and protein domains have made characterization of such organization in biological membranes and model systems difficult. Here we introduce a new method for measuring the colocalization of lipids in monolayers and bilayers using stable isotope labeling. We take advantage of a process that occurs in dynamic SIMS called atomic recombination, in which atoms on different molecules combine to form diatomic ions that are detected with a NanoSIMS instrument. This process is highly sensitive to the distance between molecules. By measuring the efficiency of the formation of 13C15N\xe2\x80\x93 ions from 13C and 15N atoms on different lipid molecules, we measure variations in the lateral organization of bilayers even though these heterogeneities occur on a length scale of only a few nm, well below the diameter of the primary ion beam of the NanoSIMS instrument or even the best super-resolution fluorescence methods. Using this technique, we provide direct evidence for nanoscale phase separation in a model membrane, which may provide a better model for the organization of biological membranes than lipid mixtures with microscale phase separation. We expect this technique to be broadly applicable to any assembly where very short scale proximity is of interest or unknown, both in chemical and biological systems."
"Tandem junction photoelectrochemical water-splitting devices, whereby two light absorbing electrodes targeting separate portions of the solar spectrum generate the voltage required to convert water to oxygen and hydrogen, enable much higher possible efficiencies than single absorber systems. We report here on the development of a tandem system consisting of a dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPEC) wired in series with a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC). The DSPEC photoanode incorporates a tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)-type chromophore and molecular ruthenium based water oxidation catalyst. The DSPEC was tested with two more-red absorbing DSC variations, one utilizing N719 dye with an I3\xe2\x80\x93/I\xe2\x80\x93 redox mediator solution and the other D35 dye with a tris(bipyridine)cobalt ([Co(bpy)3]3+/2+) based mediator. The tandem configuration consisting of the DSPEC and D35/[Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ based DSC gave the best overall performance and demonstrated the production of H2 from H2O with the only energy input from simulated solar illumination."
"We use micro-Raman spectroscopy to measure the vibrational structure of the atomically precise cadmium selenide quantum dots Cd35Se20X30L30, Cd56Se35X42L42, and Cd84Se56X56L56. These quantum dots have benzoate (X) and n-butylamine (L) ligands and tetrahedral (Td) shape with edges that range from 1.7 to 2.6 nm in length. Investigating this previously unexplored size regime allows us to identify the transition from molecular vibrations to bulk phonons in cadmium selenide quantum dots for the first time. Room-temperature Raman spectra have broad CdSe peaks at 175 and 200 cm\xe2\x80\x931. Density functional theory calculations assign these peaks to molecular surface and interior vibrational modes, respectively, and show that the interior, surface, and ligand atom motion is strongly coupled. The interior peak intensity increases relative to the surface peak as the cluster size increases due to the relative increase in the polarizability of interior modes with quantum dot size. The Raman spectra do not change with temperature for molecular Cd35Se20X30L30, while the interior peak narrows and shifts to higher energy as temperature decreases for Cd84Se56X56L56, a spectral evolution typical of a phonon. This result shows that the single bulk unit cell contained within Cd84Se56X56L56 is sufficient to apply a phonon confinement model, and that Cd56Se35X42L42, with its 2.1 nm edge length, marks the boundary between molecular vibrations and phonons."
Oxide ion conductors are important materials with a range of technological applications and are currently used as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells and solid oxide electrolyzer cells. Here we report the crystal structure and electrical properties of the hexagonal perovskite derivative Ba3MoNbO8.5. Ba3MoNbO8.5 crystallizes in a hybrid of the 9R hexagonal perovskite and palmierite structures. This is a new and so far unique crystal structure that contains a disordered distribution of (Mo/Nb)O6 octahedra and (Mo/Nb)O4 tetrahedra. Ba3MoNbO8.5 shows a wide stability range and exhibits predominantly oxide ion conduction over a pO2 range from 10\xe2\x80\x9320 to 1 atm with a bulk conductivity of 2.2 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x933 S cm\xe2\x80\x931 at 600 \xc2\xb0C. The high level of conductivity in a new structure family suggests that further study of hexagonal perovskite derivatives containing mixed tetrahedral and octahedral geometry could open up new horizons in the design of oxygen conducting electrolytes.
"Cytochrome c can acquire peroxidase activity when it binds to cardiolipin in mitochondrial membranes. The resulting oxygenation of cardiolipin by cytochrome c provides an early signal for the onset of apoptosis. The structure of this enzyme\xe2\x80\x93substrate complex is a matter of considerable debate. We present three structures at 1.7\xe2\x80\x932.0 \xc3\x85 resolution of a domain-swapped dimer of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c with the detergents, CYMAL-5, CYMAL-6, and \xcf\x89-undecylenyl-\xce\xb2-d-maltopyranoside, bound in a channel that places the hydrocarbon moieties of these detergents next to the heme. The heme is poised for peroxidase activity with water bound in place of Met80, which serves as the axial heme ligand when cytochrome c functions as an electron carrier. The hydroxyl group of Tyr67 sits 3.6\xe2\x80\x934.0 \xc3\x85 from the nearest carbon of the detergents, positioned to act as a relay in radical abstraction during peroxidase activity. Docking studies with linoleic acid, the most common fatty acid component of cardiolipin, show that C11 of linoleic acid can sit adjacent to Tyr67 and the heme, consistent with the oxygenation pattern observed in lipidomics studies. The well-defined hydrocarbon binding pocket provides atomic resolution evidence for the extended lipid anchorage model for cytochrome c/cardiolipin binding. Dimer dissociation/association kinetics for yeast versus equine cytochrome c indicate that formation of mammalian cytochrome c dimers in vivo would require catalysis. However, the dimer structure shows that only a modest deformation of monomeric cytochrome c would suffice to form the hydrocarbon binding site occupied by these detergents."
"The \xce\xb1-and \xce\xb2-phases of the thiazyl radical p-NCC6F4CNSSN\xe2\x80\xa2 (1) can be selectively prepared by careful control of the sublimation conditions, with the \xce\xb1-phase crystallizing preferentially when the substrate temperature is maintained below \xe2\x88\x9210 \xc2\xb0C, whereas the \xce\xb2-phase is isolated when the substrate temperature is maintained at or above ambient temperature. Differential scanning calorimatry studies reveal that the \xce\xb1-phase converts to the \xce\xb2-phase upon warming over the range 111\xe2\x80\x93117 \xc2\xb0C (\xce\x94H = +4 kJ\xc2\xb7mol\xe2\x80\x931) via a melt\xe2\x80\x93recrystallization process, with the \xce\xb2-phase itself melting at 167\xe2\x80\x93170 \xc2\xb0C (\xce\x94Hfus = 27 kJ\xc2\xb7mol\xe2\x80\x931). IR and Raman spectroscopy can be used to clearly discriminate between 1\xce\xb1 and 1\xce\xb2. The \xce\xb1-phase shows a broad maximum in the magnetic susceptibility around 8 K that, coupled with a broad maximum in the heat capacity, is indicative of short-range order. Some field dependence of the susceptibility below 3 K is observed, but the lack of features in the ac susceptibility, M vs H plots, or heat capacity mitigates against long-range order in 1\xce\xb1."
"Fabrication of thin films made of metal\xe2\x80\x93organic frameworks (MOFs) has been intensively pursued for practical applications that use the structural response of MOFs. However, to date, only physisorption-induced structural response has been studied in these films. Chemisorption can be expected to provide a remarkable structural response because of the formation of bonds between guest molecules and reactive metal sites in host MOFs. Here, we report that chemisorption-induced two-way structural transformation in a nanometer-sized MOF thin film. We prepared a two-dimensional layered-type MOF Fe[Pt(CN)4] thin film using a step-by-step approach. Although the as-synthesized film showed poor crystallinity, the dehydrated form of this thin film had a highly oriented crystalline nature (Film-D) as confirmed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD). Surprisingly, under water and pyridine vapors, Film-D showed chemisorption-induced dynamic structural transformations to Fe(L)2[Pt(CN)4] thin films [L = H2O (Film-H), pyridine (Film-P)], where water and pyridine coordinated to the open Fe2+ site. Dynamic structural transformations were also confirmed by in situ XRD, sorption measurement, and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy. This is the first report of chemisorption-induced dynamic structural response in a MOF thin film, and it provides useful insights, which would lead to future practical applications of MOFs utilizing chemisorption-induced structural responses."
"A palladium-catalyzed thiocarbonylation of styrene derivatives is reported for the first time. The combination of thiols as nucleophiles and a bidentate ligand ensures a unique reaction outcome with high regioselectivity toward the more valuable branched isomer and new reactivity. The ambient reaction conditions (temperature, catalyst loading) and the use of a CO surrogate render this transformation a useful method for the synthesis of thioesters from available feedstock. Various functional groups on arene and thiol substituents are tolerated by the system. Notably, challenging ortho-substituted styrenes are converted with unprecedentedly high regioselectivity."
"Thin films with tunable and homogeneous composition are required for many applications. We report the synthesis and characterization of a new class of compositionally homogeneous thin films that are amorphous solid solutions of Al2O3 and transition metal oxides (TMOx) including VOx, CrOx, MnOx, Fe2O3, CoOx, NiO, CuOx, and ZnO. The synthesis is enabled by the rapid decomposition of molecular transition-metal nitrates TM(NO3)x at low temperature along with precondensed oligomeric Al(OH)x(NO3)3\xe2\x80\x93x cluster species, both of which can be processed from aq solution. The films are dense, ultrasmooth (Rrms < 1 nm, near 0.1 nm in many cases), and atomically mixed amorphous metal-oxide alloys over a large composition range. We assess the chemical principles that favor the formation of amorphous homogeneous films over rougher phase-segregated nanocrystalline films. The synthesis is easily extended to other compositions of transition and main-group metal oxides. To demonstrate versatility, we synthesized amorphous V0.1Cr0.1Mn0.1Fe0.1Zn0.1Al0.5Ox and V0.2Cr0.2Fe0.2Al0.4Ox with Rrms \xe2\x89\x88 0.1 nm and uniform composition. The combination of ideal physical properties (dense, smooth, uniform) and broad composition tunability provides a platform for film synthesis that can be used to study fundamental phenomena when the effects of transition metal cation identity, solid-state concentration of d-electrons or d-states, and/or crystallinity need to be controlled. The new platform has broad potential use in controlling interfacial phenomena such as electron transfer in solar-cell contacts or surface reactivity in heterogeneous catalysis."
"Creating synthetic chemical systems which emulate the complexity observed in cells relies on exploiting chemical networks exhibiting nonlinear kinetic behavior. While control over reaction complexity using synthetic gene regulatory networks and DNA nanotechnology has developed greatly, little control exists over small molecule reaction networks. Toward this goal, we demonstrate a general framework for inducing nonlinear kinetic behavior in dynamic chemical networks based on molecules containing reversible chemical bonds. Specifically, this strategy relies on constituent species with differing thermodynamic stabilities that readily exchange components at rates that are faster than their formation rates. Such nonlinear networks (NLN) readily lead to sigmoidal kinetic profiles as a function of the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the constituent species. Furthermore, this behavior could be readily extended to more complex mixtures while maintaining nonlinearity. The generality of this method opens the possibility to generate nonlinear networks using a broad range of small molecule structures."
"Ion-pair interactions between a cationic ruthenium complex, [Ru(dtb)2(dea)][PF6]2, C12+ where dea is 4,4\xe2\x80\xb2-diethanolamide-2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-bipyridine and dtb is 4,4\xe2\x80\xb2-di-tert-butyl-2,2\xe2\x80\xb2-bipyridine, and chloride, bromide, and iodide are reported. A remarkable result is that a 1:1 iodide:excited-state ion-pair, [C12+, I\xe2\x80\x93]+*, underwent diffusional electron-transfer oxidation of iodide that did not occur when ion-pairing was absent. The ion-pair equilibrium constants ranged 104\xe2\x80\x93106 M\xe2\x80\x931 in CH3CN and decreased in the order Cl\xe2\x80\x93 > Br\xe2\x80\x93 > I\xe2\x80\x93. The ion-pairs had longer-lived excited states, were brighter emitters, and stored more free energy than did the non-ion-paired states. The 1H NMR spectra revealed that the halides formed tight ion-pairs with the amide and alcohol groups of the dea ligand. Electron-transfer reactivity of the ion-paired excited state was not simply due to it being a stronger photooxidant than the non-ion-paired excited state. Instead, work term, \xce\x94Gw was the predominant contributor to the driving force for the reaction. Natural bond order calculations provided natural atomic charges that enabled quantification of \xce\x94Gw for all the atoms in C12+ and [C12+, I\xe2\x80\x93]+* presented herein as contour diagrams that show the most favorable electrostatic positions for halide interactions. The results were most consistent with a model wherein the non-ion-paired C12+* excited state traps the halide and prevents its oxidation, but allows for dynamic oxidation of a second iodide ion."
"Understanding and controlling the electronic structure of molecules is crucial when designing and optimizing new organic semiconductor materials. We report the regioselective synthesis of eight \xcf\x80-expanded diarenoindacene analogues based on the indeno[1,2-b]fluorene framework along with the computational investigation of an array of diareno-fused antiaromatic compounds possessing s-indacene, pentalene, or cyclobutadiene cores. Analysis of the experimental and computationally derived optoelectronic properties uncovered a linear correlation between the bond order of the fused arene bond and the paratropicity strength of the antiaromatic unit. The Ered1 for the pentalene and indacene core molecules correlates well with their calculated NICS\xcf\x80ZZ values. The findings of this study can be used to predict the properties of, and thus rationally design, new diareno-fused antiaromatic molecules for use as organic semiconductors."
"A new class of poly-N-vinylpyrrolidinones containing an asymmetric center at C5 of the pyrrolidinone ring were synthesized from l-amino acids. The polymers, particularly 17, were used to stabilize nanoclusters such as Pd/Au for the catalytic asymmetric oxidations of 1,3- and 1,2-cycloalkanediols and alkenes, and Cu/Au was used for C\xe2\x80\x93H oxidation of cycloalkanes. It was found that the bulkier the C5 substituent in the pyrrolidinone ring, the greater the optical yields produced. Both oxidative kinetic resolution of (\xc2\xb1)-1,3- and 1,2-trans-cycloalkanediols and desymmetrization of meso cis-diols took place with 0.15 mol % Pd/Au (3:1)-17 under oxygen atmosphere in water to give excellent chemical and optical yields of (S)-hydroxy ketones. Various alkenes were oxidized with 0.5 mol % Pd/Au (3:1)-17 under 30 psi of oxygen in water to give the dihydroxylated products in >93% ee. Oxidation of (R)-limonene at 25 \xc2\xb0C occurred at the C-1,2-cyclic alkene function yielding (1S,2R,4R)-dihydroxylimonene 49 in 92% yield. Importantly, cycloalkanes were oxidized with 1 mol % Cu/Au (3:1)-17 and 30% H2O2 in acetonitrile to afford chiral ketones in very good to excellent chemical and optical yields. Alkene function was not oxidized under the reaction conditions. Mechanisms were proposed for the oxidation reactions, and observed stereo- and regio-chemistry were summarized."
"The crystal structure of the complex of the TEM-1 \xce\xb2-lactamase from Escherichia coli inhibited by 6\xce\xb1-(hydroxymethyl)penicillanic acid (1) is reported herein. This is the first structure for an acyl-enzyme intermediate with a substrate reported for a native class A \xce\xb2-lactamase. This compound was designed and synthesized as a molecule that would acylate the active site of the enzyme, but would resist deacylation by virtue of the fact that its C6\xce\xb1 hydroxymethyl moiety was expected to occupy the space near the hydrolytic water molecule (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 11055). The crystal structure of the acyl-enzyme species is closely similar to one of the two energy-minimized acyl-enzyme models generated in the course of the design aspect of the work. The crystal structure provides evidence for a number of mechanistic features for the inhibition process and the ultimate recovery of the activity. Our results reported herein are consistent with the side-chain carboxylate of Glu-166 being the active-site basic function that activates the hydrolytic water for the deacylation step in the course of catalysis by class A \xce\xb2-lactamases. The design principles applied for compound 1 hold the promise of general utility for development of novel inhibitors for other hydrolytic enzymes. "
"The mechanism of hydrolysis of cefepime, a novel cephalosporin, by the class A TEMpUC19 \xce\xb2-lactamase has been investigated. Models for the active-site binding of this antibiotic indicate severe steric interactions between the active site of the enzyme and the C7\xce\xb2 function of cefepime. Specific interactions with the side-chain functions of Pro-167 and Asn-170, amino acids present in the \xce\xa9-loop spanning residues 164\xe2\x88\x92179, have been singled out as important in the interactions with the antibiotic. These interactions displace the hydrolytic water (Wat-712) from its preferred position for the deacylation step. These observations are consistent with experimental evidence that deacylation is the rate-limiting step in the turnover of cefepime by this \xce\xb2-lactamase. Furthermore, it has been shown in circular-dichroic measurements that hydrolysis of cefepime by this \xce\xb2-lactamase is accompanied by an unprecedented relaxation of the structure of the enzyme in order to accommodate the bulky C7\xce\xb2 side chain of the antibiotic in the active site. These findings are in good agreement with dynamics simulations of the structure of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, which support the possibility for the structural relaxation of the protein once this intermediate forms. The class C \xce\xb2-lactamase Q908R, lacking the \xce\xa9-loop structural motif, turns over cefepime, and the kinetic parameters for this process were evaluated. In contrast to the class A \xce\xb2-lactamase which we studied, the kinetics were sufficiently fast that circular-dichroic experiments with the Q908R enzyme during hydrolysis of cefepime could not be carried out. Two mutant variants of the class A TEMpUC19 \xce\xb2-lactamase, Asp-179-Gly and Arg-164-Asn, were prepared to explore whether an enlargement of the active site would facilitate turnover of cefepime. Both mutant enzymes showed improved interactions with cefepime, consistent with our expectations. Kinetic analyses for turnover of cefepime by the parental enzyme and both of its mutant derivatives are presented. "
"N-Succinyl-ll-diaminopimelate aminotransferase (DAP-AT) (EC 2.6.1.17), a key enzyme in the bacterial pathway to l-lysine, was purified to near homogeneity (1500-fold) in five steps from wild type Escherichia coli ATCC 9637. This pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme has a molecular weight of 39.9 kDa, appears to form an active homodimer, and uses l-glutamate as the amino group donor for its substrate, N-succinyl-\xce\xb1-amino-\xce\xb5-ketopimelic acid (1a) (Km = 0.18 \xc2\xb1 0.04 mM, kcat = 86 \xc2\xb1 5 s-1). Progress of the reaction is monitored by spectrophotometric observation of decrease in NADPH concentration at 340 nm in a coupled enzyme assay with l-glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.4). Stereochemically pure 1a was synthesized as its trilithium salt by ene reaction of methyl glyoxylate with methyl N-succinyl-l-allylglycinate (4a) followed by hydrogenation of the double bond, Dess\xe2\x88\x92Martin oxidation of the alcohol, and careful lithium hydroxide hydrolysis. Similar approaches allowed synthesis of a series of substrate analogues 1b\xe2\x88\x92g having different N-acyl substituents, as well as derivatives missing the carboxyl group or the amide functionality (13 and 17, respectively). Compounds lacking the keto functionality (18a, 18c, and 19) were also prepared. Assay of DAP-AT shows that the enzyme has quite strict requirements for substrate recognition, but it will accept compounds with an aromatic ring in place of the terminal succinyl carboxyl group in 1a (e.g. N-Cbz-\xce\xb1-amino-\xce\xb5-ketopimelic acid (1c)). Reaction of substrates 1a,c with hydrazine hydrate followed by NaCNBH3 reduction gives 2-(N-(succinylamino))- (20a) and 2-(N-Cbz-amino)-6-hydrazinoheptane-1,7-dioic acids (20c), respectively. These are the most potent slow-binding inhibitors of any DAP-metabolyzing enzyme reported so far (Ki* for DAP-AT:\xe2\x80\x89 20a is 22 \xc2\xb1 4 nM; 20c is 54 \xc2\xb1 9 nM). "
"The \xce\xb1V\xce\xb23 integrin is implicated in human tumor metastasis and in angiogenesis. The design of low-molecular-mass \xce\xb1V\xce\xb23 antagonists by \xe2\x80\x9cspatial screening\xe2\x80\x9d led to the highly active peptides c(RGDFV) and c(RGDFV). Here the influence of the amino acids in positions 4 and 5 flanking the RGD-sequence on the inhibition of vitronectin and fibrinogen binding to the isolated \xce\xb1V\xce\xb23 and \xce\xb1IIb\xce\xb23 receptors was investigated. The influence of the side chain and the backbone conformation on activity and selectivity was studied. The compounds were divided into conformational classes. For each class at least one representative peptide was subjected to detailed structure determination in solution. The peptides of classes 1, 2, and 3 show a \xce\xb2II\xe2\x80\x98/\xce\xb3-turn arrangement with the d-amino acid in the i + 1 position of the \xce\xb2II\xe2\x80\x98-turn. By contrast, the peptides of class 4 reveal a modified \xce\xb2II\xe2\x80\x98/\xce\xb3-turn pattern with glycine in the i + 1 position of the \xce\xb2II\xe2\x80\x98-turn and the d-amino acid in the i + 1 position of the \xce\xb3-turn. Class 1 is divided into two subclasses:\xe2\x80\x89 besides the \xce\xb2II\xe2\x80\x98/\xce\xb3-turn arrangement a \xce\xb3/\xce\xb3-turn motif is found for two members of this class. Structure\xe2\x88\x92activity relationship (SAR) investigations show that the amino acid in position 4 and the proton of the amide bond between residues 3 and 4 are essential for high biological activities toward \xce\xb1V\xce\xb23. By contrast, the amino acid in position 5 has no influence on the activity. A bent conformation of the RGD-sequence, as observed for the peptides of classes 1 and 2, fits the \xce\xb1V\xce\xb23 better than the \xce\xb1IIb\xce\xb23 receptor and so increases the selectivity of these peptides.

"Arylcyclopropylcarbenium ions, Ar(c-Pr)CH+, were generated as transient intermediates by laser flash photolysis (LFP) of trans-2,3-diphenylaziridinimines of aryl cyclopropyl ketones in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). The carbocations are thought to arise by way of diazo compounds and carbenes. Rate constants for the unimolecular decay in TFE and for the bimolecular reaction with methanol in TFE were obtained for Ar(c-Pr)CH+ and for analogous arylphenylcarbenium ions, ArPhCH+. Within these series, the cation stabilizing abilities of cyclopropyl and phenyl groups are found to be similar in magnitude. However, cyclopropyl responds more strongly than phenyl to increasing electron demand. Hence cyclopropyl is superior to phenyl in cation stabilizing ability for Ar = Ph but inferior to phenyl for Ar = 4-MeOC6H4. "
"Fluorescence spectra of trans-1-(2-naphthyl)-2-phenylethene (NPE) obtained at different excitation wavelengths and tri-n-butylamine (TBA) concentrations in methylcyclohexane are resolved into four distinct components by application of principal component analysis with self-modeling. Two of the components are the NPE conformer fluorescence spectra, and the other two are the corresponding NPE\xc2\xb7TBA exciplexes. Pure component combination coefficients are based on optimization of global (\xce\xbbexc-independent) Stern\xe2\x88\x92Volmer plots for the monomers and exciplex fluorescence plots for the exciplexes. Conformer-specific fluorescence quenching rate constants by the amine are obtained for the first time. These are indistinguishable from the corresponding exciplex formation rate constants. Fortuitously, the Stern\xe2\x88\x92Volmer constants for the two singlet excited conformer/TBA interactions differ by only \xe2\x88\xbc25%, revealing high conformer selectivity by TBA. This selectivity is consistent with the large shift between the \xce\xbbmax of the two exciplex fluorescence spectra which reveals the more favorable (2.9 kcal/mol) reduction potential of NPEA, the less extended conformer.

"The biosynthetic pathway of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) formation was studied with cell-free extracts from the rifamycin B producer, Amycolatopsis mediterranei S699, and the ansatrienin A producer, Streptomyces collinus T\xc3\xbc1892. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) plus erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) gave AHBA in low but nevertheless significant (6%) yield. 3,4-Dideoxy-4-amino-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (aminoDAHP) was converted efficiently into AHBA (45%), as were 5-deoxy-5-amino-3-dehydroquinic acid (aminoDHQ, 41%) and 5-deoxy-5-amino-3-dehydroshikimic acid (aminoDHS, 95%). On the other hand, the normal shikimate pathway intermediate, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) did not give rise to AHBA under these conditions. AminoDAHP (9%) was produced by incubation of [14C]PEP and E4P, but not of [14C]DAHP, with the cell-free extracts. The results demonstrate the operation of a new variant of the shikimate pathway in the formation of the mC7N units of ansamycin, and presumably also mitomycin, antibiotics which leads from PEP, E4P, and a nitrogen source directly to aminoDAHP and then via aminoDHQ and aminoDHS to AHBA.

"Flow pyrolysis of 2-methyl-2-propyl 1\xe2\x80\x98-propenyl sulfoxide (9b) affords a 98:2 mixture of (Z)- and (E)-propanethial S-oxide ((Z)- and (E)-5b), both characterized by Fourier transform microwave (FT-MW) spectroscopy. Sulfines (Z)- and (E)-5b are also identified by FT-MW in chopped onion volatiles and by NMR spectroscopy in onion extracts. Similarly, flow pyrolysis of 2-methyl-2-propyl vinyl sulfoxide (9c) affords (Z)- and (E)-isomers of ethanethial S-oxide (5a), identified by FT-MW methods. Pyrolysis in the presence of D2O affords (Z)-5a-d1 and (Z)-5a-d2 from 9c and (Z)-5b-d1 from 9b; (Z)-5b-d1 is also produced when an onion is homogenized in D2O. Pyrolysis of 9c with ethyl propiolate gives ethyl (E)-3-(vinylsulfinyl)acrylate (10). Neat 5a at 100 \xc2\xb0C gives acetaldehyde. On standing, 5b dimerizes to trans-3,4-diethyl-1,2-dithietane 1,1-dioxide (12a); Me3SiCHS+\xe2\x88\x92O- (5f) undergoes an analogous dimerization. Compound 5b shows moderate potency as an anticarcinogen in inducing the enzyme quinone reductase. "
"A synthesis of the complete carbon skeleton of the nargenicins, represented by tricyclic lactone 45, is described. The key step of the synthesis of 45 is the Yamaguchi macrolactonization of hydroxy acid 44 which is followed by the facile transannular Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reaction of the 18-membered macrolide 22. This sequence provides tricycle 45 in 66% yield, along with a 14% yield of tricycle 46 which is epimeric at C(10). Macrolide 22 was obtained in 38% yield when the macrolactonization was performed at 80 \xc2\xb0C. The transannular Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reaction of 22 at 80 \xc2\xb0C provided tricycle 45 as the exclusive product (85% yield). In contrast, the intramolecular Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reaction of seco ester 43 provided a mixture of trans-fused 47 in 56% yield and the desired cis-fused cycloadduct 48 in only 27% yield. Two independent stereochemical control features determine the success of the transannular Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reaction of 22:\xe2\x80\x89 the C(6)\xe2\x88\x92Br steric directing group that dictates that only one of the two faces of the diene is accessible to the dienophile in transition state 14 and allylic strain considerations involving the C(16)\xe2\x88\x92Me substituent which enable only one face of the dienophile to be accessible to the diene in transition state 14. The latter effect is operational only in the transannular cycloaddition mode as indicated by the results with 43. An added benefit of this strategy is that the 10-membered lactone is established by a formal ring contraction of the more easily synthesized 18-membered lactone. Attempts to extend this strategy to the transannular Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reaction of the C(13)-hydroxyl substituted macrolide 13 have not been successful. "
"The enantioselective total synthesis of the potent antiparasitic agent milbemycin D (1) has been achieved. The spiroketal fragment is prepared through a novel spiroketalization of a hydroxy pyrone to set the anomeric stereocenter and establish functionality for the stereocontrolled attachment and subsequent extension of the connecting chain between the spiroketal and the hexahydrobenzofuran fragment. The hexahydrobenzofuran fragment is constructed through the exploitation of a sequential electrophilic cyclization\xe2\x88\x92[2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement to close the oxygen-containing ring and incorporate the C5 hydroxyl. A lithium bromide accelerated Wittig olefination joins the spiroketal-containing subunit and the hexahydrobenzofuran subunit at the C10,11 double bond in high yield. Subsequent oxidation of the C1 hydroxyl provides access to the seco acid, which smoothly undergoes macrolactonization. The sensitive C2 stereochemistry and the C3,4 double bond are incorporated without epimerization at C2 or migration of the C3,4 double bond. "
A family of novel oligomers based on the anthranilamide nucleus has been prepared and shown to form well-defined secondary structural features. 1H NMR and X-ray crystallographic techniques have demonstrated that intramolecular hydrogen bonds play a key role in stabilizing both linear sheet and helical conformational forms. 
"We have analyzed M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectra of a model complex of known structure with an Fe2+(S1=2)\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xbcOH\xe2\x88\x92Cr3+(S2=3/2) center (A) and of its Fe3+(S1 = 5/2)\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xbcO\xe2\x88\x92Cr3+(S2=3/2) analog (B). These \xce\xbc-hydroxo and \xce\xbc-oxo bridged binuclear metal centers display unusual magnetic properties as found in several diiron\xe2\x88\x92oxo proteins. Our results confirm antiferromagnetic spin coupling between Fe and Cr ions which results in Seff = 1/2 and Seff = 1 ground states for A and B, respectively. The isotropic exchange \xe2\x84\x8bex = JS1\xc2\xb7S2 is weaker for the \xce\xbc-hydroxo (J \xe2\x89\x88 21 cm-1) than for the \xce\xbc-oxo (J \xe2\x89\x88 275 cm-1) complex. Spectra recorded at 4.2 K, in fields of 0.22\xe2\x88\x924.7 T, have been analyzed with the effective spin Hamiltonian for the ground state \xe2\x84\x8beff = \xce\xb2Seff\xc2\xb7g\xcc\x83eff\xc2\xb7H + + I1\xc2\xb7P\xcc\x831\xc2\xb7I1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xb2ngnH\xc2\xb7I1. For complex B, the zero-field splitting Seff\xc2\xb7D\xcc\x83eff\xc2\xb7Seff is also included in \xe2\x84\x8beff. In applied fields, the 4.2 K spectra of Fe2+ in A showed hyperfine splittings which allowed the determination of the following Seff = 1/2 Hamiltonian parameters:\xe2\x80\x89 1/3 Tr g\xcc\x83eff \xe2\x89\x88 2.00, = \xe2\x88\x92(18.3,5.6,25.0) T, \xce\x94EQ = +2.87 mm/s, \xce\xb7 = 0.93, and \xce\xb4Fe = 1.21 mm/s. The weak coupling of A allows the zero-field splitting to mix higher spin manifolds with the ground state doublet, and, to obtain intrinsic parameters, we also calculated the spectra of Fe2+ by diagonalizing the (2S1 + 1 = 5) \xc3\x97 (2S2 + 1 = 4) matrix of the Hamiltonian \xe2\x84\x8b = JS1\xc2\xb7S2 + + \xce\xb2Si\xc2\xb7g\xcc\x83i\xc2\xb7H} + S1\xc2\xb7\xc3\xa31\xc2\xb7I1 + I1\xc2\xb7P\xcc\x831\xc2\xb7I1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xb2ngnH\xc2\xb7I1. We determined the following parameters for Fe2+:\xe2\x80\x89 D1 = +4.0 cm-1, E1 = +0.4 cm-1, 1/3 Tr g\xcc\x831 \xe2\x89\xb3 2.07, \xc3\xa31/gn\xce\xb2n = \xe2\x88\x92(10.2,3.5,15.6) T. For complex B, we found that Fe3+ has a large quadrupole splitting (\xce\x94EQ = \xe2\x88\x922.00 mm/s, \xce\xb7 = 0.22) presumably as a result of anisotropic covalency due to the close proximity of the bridging O2-. This large \xce\x94EQ is comparable to values found in diiron\xe2\x88\x92oxo proteins. Spectra of B in applied fields also displayed hyperfine splittings, and the following Seff = 1 Hamiltonian parameters could be deduced:\xe2\x80\x89 Deff = +3.9 cm-1, Eeff = +1.7 cm-1, 1/3 Tr g\xcc\x83eff = 2.01, = \xe2\x88\x92(33.8,30.9,35.8) T, \xce\xb4Fe = 0.52 mm/s.

"The R2 subunit of Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) contains a stable tyrosyl radical (\xe2\x80\xa2Y122) diferric cluster cofactor. Earlier studies on the cofactor assembly reaction detected a paramagnetic intermediate, X, that was found to be kinetically competent to oxidize Y122. Studies using rapid freeze-quench (RFQ) M\xc3\xb6ssbauer and EPR spectroscopies led to the proposal that X is comprised of two high spin ferric ions and a S = 1/2 ligand radical, mutually spin coupled to give a S = 1/2 ground state (Ravi, N.; Bollinger, J. M., Jr.; Huynh, B. H.; Edmondson, D. E.; Stubbe, J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994, 116, 8007\xe2\x88\x928014). An extension of RFQ methodology to Q-band ENDOR spectroscopy using 57Fe has shown that one of the irons has a very nearly isotropic hyperfine tensor (A(FeA) = \xe2\x88\x92[74.2(2), 72.2(2), 73.2(2)] MHz) as expected for FeIII, but that the other iron site displays considerable anisotropy (A(FeB) = +[27.5(2), 36.8(2), 36.8(2)] MHz), indicative of substantial FeIV character. Reanalysis of the M\xc3\xb6ssbauer data using these results leads to isomer shifts of \xce\xb4(FeA) = 0.56(3) mm/s and \xce\xb4(FeB) = 0.26(4) mm/s. Based on the hyperfine anisotropy of FeB plus the reduced isomer shift, X is now best described as a spin-coupled FeIII/FeIV center without a radical, but with significant spin delocalization onto the oxygen ligand(s).

"Zeolite synthesis results for the use of a family of related quaternary ammonium derivatives of tricyclodecane hydrocarbons as structure-directing agents are described. The work continues our interest in how rigid polycyclic hydrocarbons, as charged derivatives, occupy space in developing guest/host zeolite lattices. The zeolite product chemistry was probed as to the three-dimensional structures formed, particularly in relation to synthesis variables like boron substitution for silicon in the lattice, OH-/SiO2 reactant concentration, and the stereochemistry of the polar substituents off the tricyclo[5.2.1.02.6]decane hydrocarbon frame; all three factors were found to have an impact on the zeolites which crystallized. Some correlations were also studied for how these factors influenced the size and architecture of the resulting pore systems. Monte Carlo methods were also applied to calculate favorable docking energies for geometry-optimized organo-cations placed in the host lattices. "
"The amavadine complex and its model [VL2]2- (L = -ON[CH(CH3)COO-]2 (HIDPA3-) or -ON(CH2COO-)2 (HIDA3-), respectively) undergo, in aqueous medium and at a Pt electrode, a fully electrochemical and chemical reversible Viv/v oxidation and act as electron-transfer mediators in the electrocatalytic oxidation of some thiols (HSR) such as HS(CH2)nCOOH (n = 1 or 2, i.e, mercaptoacetic or mercaptopropionic acid, respectively) and HSCH2CH(NH2)COOH (cysteine) to the corresponding disulfides (RS-SR) which were isolated upon bulk preparative electrolyses. As shown by digital simulation of cyclic voltammetry, this redox catalysis process occurs through an unprecedented mechanism involving Michaelis\xe2\x88\x92Menten type kinetics with formation (k1 = 1.2 \xc3\x97 103 M-1 s-1) of an intermediate species (with half-life time of ca. 0.3 s) derived from the interaction of the oxidized vanadium complex (the active form of the mediator) with the substrate. A possible biological role for amavadine is suggested by these results. "
"Ab initio (UHF/6-31G*) and density functional (Becke3LYP/D95*) calculations have been used to investigate the structures and stabilities of the radical cations of the DNA bases and base pairs. The calculated structures of the base pairs show excellent agreement with crystallographic data. The most easily oxidizable base, guanine, forms a particularly stable radical cation base pair with cytosine, so that the calculated adiabatic ionization potential for the guanine\xe2\x88\x92cytosine hydrogen-bonded complex is about 0.75 eV lower than that of guanine itself. UBecke3LYP/D95*//UHF/6-31G* calculations show that the shift of the central hydrogen-bonded proton at N1 of guanine to N3 of cytosine is only slightly endothermic (+1.6 kcal mol-1). The product of the corresponding proton shift in the adenine\xe2\x88\x92thymine system is unfavorable by +14.1 kcal mol-1. These results suggest that the guanine\xe2\x88\x92cytosine radical cation represents even more of a thermodynamic sink in oxidized DNA than might be concluded from the ionization potentials of the individual bases, and that it enjoys about 7.3 kcal mol-1 extra stabilization from the central low-barrier hydrogen bond.

"Molecular mechanics have been employed to study the conformations of the oligomeric metallocene species Fc[Fe(C5H4)2XMe2]nH (Fc = Fe(C5H5)(C5H4); X = Si, n = 1 (1); X = C, n = 1 (2); X = Si, n = 2 (3); X = C, n = 2 (4); X = Si, n = 4 (5)) and their cations. The calculations utilize the new generalized ESFF forcefield; they show that the neutral molecules are conformationally flexible with the lowest energy configurations having close contacts between the positively charged iron atoms of the ferrocene units and the negatively charged cyclopentadienyl rings of their neighbors. The carbon-bridged species have harder potential surfaces than their silicon analogues, but replacement of the methyl groups of the bridge with longer alkyl chains was found to have very little effect on the relative orientation of the ferrocene units. The conformations of the molecules 3, 4, and 5 in their experimental crystal structures were found to be significantly different from the calculated low energy isolated conformers. However, the solid state conformations allow intermolecular iron\xe2\x88\x92cyclopentadienyl interactions analogous to the intramolecular interactions found for the isolated species. In contrast, the conformation of (3)3+ in the crystal structure is very similar to the calculated low energy isolated conformer, since the conformations are primarily determined by Fe\xe2\x88\x92Fe repulsion. Implications of this work for the structures of high-molecular weight poly(ferrocenylsilanes) are discussed. "
"In examining NMR methods to assess orientation and fluxional motions of planar N-donor heterocyclic coordinated ligands (L\'s) in solution, we introduce the use of exchange-NOE NMR data as a powerful method for defining (i) the extent of L rotation about the metal-N bond, (ii) the direction of L rotation, and (iii) even the halves of C2-symmetrical L\'s that interchange during dynamic processes. The full value of the approach depends on a strategy in which the complexes studied are chiral and similar except that one has a lopsided L (Me3Bzm = 1,5,6-trimethylbenzimidazole in [Re2O3Cl4(Me3Bzm)4] (1)) and the other has a C2-symmetrical L (3,5-lut = 3,5-lutidine in [Re2O3Cl4(3,5-lut)4] (2)). Each Re is part of a nearly linear ORe\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92ReO grouping and has a \xe2\x80\x9cterminal\xe2\x80\x9d L (Lt) and a stacked L (Ls). The fluxional inversion of the two chiral dimers involves rotations of \xe2\x88\xbc180\xc2\xb0 about the Re\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92Re bonds and of \xe2\x88\xbc90\xc2\xb0 about all four Re\xe2\x88\x92L bonds. The exchange-NOE data for 2 show that the half of Lt away from the dimer center interchanges with the half of Ls close to the center, with the L plane rotating past the ORe\xe2\x88\x92O bonds, not the N\xe2\x88\x92Re\xe2\x88\x92Cl bonds. Thus, the exchange-NOE data help to establish the direction of L rotation. In 1, Me3Bzmt has the rare head-to-head (HH) orientation with respect to the partner. This partner Me3Bzms stacks with the Me3Bzms from the other Re in the common head-to-tail (HT) orientation. Compelling evidence that the predominant solution conformer of 1 has the HH,HT,HH structure includes unusual chemical shift dispersions and a strong interligand NOE cross-peak. This is the only case in which cis,bis imidazole-ring-ligated untethered ligands have been found to be predominantly HH in solution. This predominance can be attributed to the electrostatic attraction of the \xce\xb4+ N2C proton for the negative core of the molecule (bridging O, cis Cl on same Re, and two cis Cl\'s on the other Re).

"A novel two-dimensional double-quantum NMR technique for determining the torsion angle \xcf\x88 in doubly-13C-labeled amino acid residues of solid peptides is presented. The intensity pattern in the two-dimensional NMR spectrum reflects the orientation of the C\xce\xb1\xe2\x88\x92H bond with respect to the carbonyl moiety, by correlating the C\xce\xb1\xe2\x88\x92H dipolar coupling with the CO chemical-shift anisotropy. This approach eliminates problems caused by 13C\xe2\x88\x9214N dipolar couplings and the relatively small chemical-shift anisotropy of the C\xce\xb1 carbon in two-dimensional double-quantum spectra based only on chemical-shift anisotropies. The double-quantum selection achieves isolated-spin background suppression and increases the spectral resolution by partially removing the inhomogeneous spectral broadening. The experiment is demonstrated on 13C\xce\xb1\xe2\x88\x9213CO-labeled leucine. With 50 mg, a useful spectrum was obtained in 3 h. The potential of the technique for distinguishing different secondary structures in peptides is demonstrated by spectral simulations. "
"The relation between the 1H chemical shift and the conformation of linear homopolypeptides and cyclic dipeptides in the solid state has been studied utilizing the 1H combined rotation and multiple pulse spectroscopy (CRAMPS) NMR method. It was found that the 1H chemical shift of the H\xce\xb1 signal of homopolypeptides depends on the secondary structure such as \xce\xb1-helix or \xce\xb2-sheet form, whereas those of the side-chain proton signals (H\xce\xb2, H\xce\xb3, H\xce\xb4, etc.) are almost independent of the secondary structure. The 1H chemical shifts of the H\xce\xb1 signal of homopolypeptides having the \xce\xb1-helix and the \xce\xb2-sheet forms were 3.9\xe2\x88\x924.0 ppm and 5.1\xe2\x88\x925.5 ppm, respectively. Accordingly, the 1H chemical shift of the H\xce\xb1 is very useful for conformational analysis of polypeptides in the solid state. Furthermore, it is shown that the 1H chemical shift of the H\xce\xb1 and the NH signals of cyclic dipeptides are sensitive to the ring conformation and the hydrogen bond length in the solid state. "
"The addition of several photochemically generated aryl and fluoroalkyl radicals to fullerene C70 was studied by electron spin resonance and the results were compared with those obtained with C60. While simple alkyl radicals afford only three of the five expected RC70\xe2\x80\xa2 regioisomers, the more reactive aryl and fluoroalkyl radicals give rise to four, except for the trifluoromethyl radical which yielded for the first time the ESR spectra of all five expected isomers. Semiempirical MO calculations and density functional theory calculations were carried out for HC60\xe2\x80\xa2 and for the five HC70\xe2\x80\xa2 regioisomers as models for the corresponding alkyl, aryl, and fluoroalkyl analogs in order to describe the unpaired electron distribution in these radical species and as an aid in the assignment of the observed spectra to specific RC70\xe2\x80\xa2 regioisomers.

"\xce\xb1-Aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) is a C\xce\xb1-tetrasubstituted amino acid that strongly favors helical structure. Most of the conformational trends established for Aib-rich peptides have been determined by X-ray crystallography. Whether these conformational trends carry over to protic solvents is an open question. In order to develop a general strategy for probing the properties of peptides containing C\xce\xb1-tetrasubstituted amino acids, the hexameric sequences Boc-TOAC-Alan-TOAC-Ala4-n-OtBu were synthesized where n = 0\xe2\x88\x923 and TOAC is a spin label Aib analog. The peptides were studied by electron spin resonance (ESR) in four alcohols:\xe2\x80\x89 MeOH, EtOH, TFE, and HFIP. Biradical J-coupling and dipolar interactions between the TOACs within each peptide were used to determine peptide geometry as a function of solvent. In MeOH, strong biradical interactions were observed consistent with the geometry of a 310-helix. The solvents displayed differing tendencies to support helical structure with the ranking MeOH > EtOH > TFE > HFIP. In HFIP, there were no indications of residual helical structure. While C\xce\xb1-tetrasubstituted amino acids do favor the helix, these data demonstrate that such amino acids do not \xe2\x80\x9clock in\xe2\x80\x9d the helical conformation. Qualitative analysis of the line width variations for the hexamers in MeOH suggests that the interconversion time for helix \xe2\x86\x92 coil is several nanoseconds. Additional peptides were prepared in order to explore the effects of peptide length, N-terminal blocking group, and insertion of an additional Aib. "
"Several polyhydroxyperhydroazepines have been obtained either by chemoenzymatic or chemical synthesis. Condensation of (\xc2\xb1)-3-azido-2-hydroxypropanaldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) in the presence of a DHAP dependent aldolase followed by treatment with acid phosphatase and an isomerase gave a 6-azido-6-deoxyaldopyranose, which upon reductive amination afforded the title compound. The iminocyclitols can also be obtained by chemical manipulations of aldopyranoses, protected as benzyl glycosides or diisopropylidene ethers. Thus, d-galactose leads to a meso-3,4,5,6-tetrahydroxyperhydroazepine, d-mannose to a derivative with a C2 symmetry axis, and N-acetylglucosamine to a 6-acetamidoiminocyclitol. Asymmetrization of the meso azasugar was carried out by chemical means, to yield a 3-methoxy-4,5,6-trihydroxyazepane. An attempted enzymatic synthesis of the methoxy derivatives of these azasugars was unsuccessful, leading, however, to both enantiomers of 1-deoxy-2-O-methylmannojirimycin. Some of these compounds display significant activity as glycosidase inhibitors, with Ki values from moderate to low micromolar range. Though all these iminocyclitols do not inhibit the mechanistically related HIV protease, the 3,6-dibenzyl derivative 30 showed moderate inhibition. The X-ray structure of 7 indicates a pseudochair conformation. "
"Human \xce\xb1-1,3-fucosyltransferase V (FucT V), which catalyzes the transfer of l-fucose moiety from guanosine diphosphate \xce\xb2-l-fucose (GDP-Fuc) to an acceptor sugar to form sialyl Lewis x (sLex), was shown to proceed through an ordered, sequential mechanism by product inhibition studies. The designed azatrisaccharide propyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-(\xce\xb2-d-galactopyranosyl)-3-O-(2-(N-(\xce\xb2-l-homofuconojirimycinyl))ethyl)-\xce\xb1-d-glucopyranoside (2), prepared by covalently linking the N-group of \xce\xb2-l-homofuconojirimycin (1) to the 3-OH of LacNAc through an ethylene unit, in the presence of GDP was found to be an effective inhibitor of FucT V. In the presence of 30 \xce\xbcM GDP, the concentration of 2 necessary to cause 50% inhibition was reduced 77-fold to 31 \xce\xbcM. Presumably, the azatrisaccharide and GDP form a complex which mimics the transition state of the enzymatic reaction. Given the low affinity of FucT V for its substrate LacNAc (Km = 35 mM), the designed azatrisaccharide in the presence of GDP represents the most potent synergistic inhibitor complex reported so far.

"Dihydroxyacetanilide, 4, is oxidized to the 5R,6S-epoxyquinone, 3, by dihydroxyacetanilide epoxidase-I (DHAE I) from Streptomyces LL-C10037, without the assistance of an organic cofactor. 13C NMR analysis revealed that in the presence of 18O2 a full equivalent of 18O is incorporated at the epoxide. However, control reactions revealed the rapid exchange of the C-4 carbonyl with H218O. By coupling the DHAE I reaction with 2-acetamido-5,6-epoxy-1,4-benzoquinone oxidoreductase (AEBQOR I) from the same organism, NADP, and an NADPH regeneration system based on glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the epoxyquinol LL-C10037\xce\xb1, 1, was produced with \xe2\x88\xbc20% incorporation of a second 18O atom at the C-4 alcohol. Therefore, DHAE I is a dioxygenase with an epoxidation mechanism essentially the same as has been observed for the dihydrovitamin K epoxidation occurring during the mammalian vitamin K-dependent glutamate carboxylase reaction.

"Surface-attached peptide nucleic acids (PNA) are shown to retain their unique and efficient hybridization properties, reported in solution studies. PNA recognition layers thus offer significant advantages for sequence-specific DNA biosensors, compared to their DNA counterparts. These advantages include significantly higher sensitivity and specificity (including greater discrimination against single-base mismatches), faster hybridization at room and elevated temperatures, minimal dependence on ionic strength, and use of shorter (10\xe2\x88\x9215-mer) probes. Such unique properties and advantages are illustrated in connection with electrochemical detection of the hybridization event using the Co(phen)33+ redox indicator and a carbon paste electrode transducer. The new capabilities and opportunities afforded by the use of PNA surface probes are discussed. "
"We describe the synthesis, structures, and DNA incorporation of deoxyribonucleosides carrying polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as the DNA \xe2\x80\x9cbase\xe2\x80\x9d analogue. The new polycyclic compounds are 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 9-phenanthrenyl, and 1-pyrenyl deoxynucleosides. The compounds are synthesized using a recently developed C-glycosidic bond formation method involving organocadmium derivatives of the aromatic compounds coupling with a 1\xce\xb1-chlorodeoxyribose precursor. The principal products of this coupling are the \xce\xb1-anomers of the deoxyribosides. An efficient method has also been developed for epimerization of the \xce\xb1-anomers to \xce\xb2-anomers by acid-catalyzed equilibration; this isomerization is successfully carried out on the four polycyclic nucleosides as well as two substituted phenyl nucleosides. The geometry of the anomeric substitution is derived from 1H NOE experiments and is also correlated with a single-crystal X-ray structure of one \xce\xb1-isomer. Three of the polycyclic C-nucleoside derivatives are incorporated into DNA oligonucleotides via their phosphoramidite derivatives; the pyrenyl and phenanthrenyl derivatives are shown to be fluorescent in a DNA sequence. The results (1) broaden the scope of our C-glycoside coupling reaction, (2) demonstrate that (using a new acid-catalyzed epimerization) both \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-anomers are easily synthesized, and (3) constitute a new class of deoxynucleoside derivatives. Such nucleoside analogues may be useful as biophysical probes for the study of noncovalent interactions such as aromatic \xcf\x80-stacking in DNA. In addition, the fluorescence of the phenanthrene and pyrene nucleosides may make them especially useful as structural probes. "
"Transesterification of primary alcohols with inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate (IcP) in the presence of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) resulted in the formation of O-alkyl inositol 1-phosphates. The starting IcP was obtained in a single step by PI-PLC catalyzed cleavage of phosphatidylinositol from the soybean phospholipid. The transesterification reaction was performed with a series of 20 structurally diverse hydroxyl compounds, ranging in the structural complexity from methanol to the serine-containing Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met tetrapeptide, to give the corresponding phosphodiesters with 20\xe2\x88\x9280% yields, depending mainly on the solubility of alcohols in water. The rates of transesterifications, and of the competing hydrolysis of IcP to inositol 1-phosphate (IP), were relatively insensitive to the alcohol structure. With polyhydroxyl compounds such as glycerol and hexitols, the enzyme displayed complete preference toward formation of the inositol phosphate derivatives of the primary hydroxyl groups. On the other hand, PI-PLC did not discriminate between primary hydroxyl groups in different environments and showed low stereoselectivity with racemic alcohols featuring a chiral center at the \xce\xb2-position. The O-alkyl inositol phosphates formed were readily separable from the hydrolytic product, IP, by the anion-exchange chromatography, and were fully characterized by means of 1H and 31P NMR and electrospray MS. Our results provide a new, simple, and efficient two-step synthetic route to substituted O-alkyl inositol phosphates from inexpensive starting materials. The reported reaction was successfully applied to synthesis of complex inositol phosphate derivatives, as illustrated by inositol phosphoesters of mono- and oligosaccharides, nucleosides and peptides. The synthetic usefulness of this reaction, however, is not limited to the examples shown. Because transesterification activity of phospholipase C has not been reported before, its mechanism is discussed in a broad context of mechanisms of phosphoesterases. "
"The dependence of hydrogen-bond interaction energies between identical amides (two formamides and two N-methylacetamides) on the hydrogen bond length (rO\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7H), the two hydrogen bond angles (\xce\xb8COH and \xce\xb8NHO), and the dihedral between the two amides (\xce\xa6CNCN) has been assessed by semiempirical calculations (SAM1 with single point transfers to AM1/SM2.1 aqueous solvation calculations). Ab initio calculations (MP2/6-31+G(d,p)//HF/6-31+G(d,p)) at given values of \xce\xa6CNCN and \xce\xb8COH predict the same change in interaction energies with changes in \xce\xb8NHO as the semiempirical calculations. With formamide, hydrogen-bond interaction energies are independent of the dihedral angle \xce\xa6CNCN when \xce\xb8COH and \xce\xb8NHO deviate less than 40\xc2\xb0 from 180\xc2\xb0. Most importantly, the increased interaction energies at \xce\xb8COH and \xce\xb8NHO below 140\xc2\xb0 and above 220\xc2\xb0 are found to be associated with steric interference between the carbonyl oxygen of the hydrogen-bond acceptor and the amide nitrogen of the hydrogen-bond donor. Comparing formamide and N-methylacetamide, the angle requirements (\xce\xb8COH, \xce\xb8NHO, and \xce\xa6CNCN) of favorable hydrogen-bond interaction energies are much more stringent for the latter due to the steric effects of the methyl substituents. In summary, by both semiempirical SAM1 and ab initio MP2/6-31+G(d,p)//HF/6-31+G(d,p) calculations, the strength of amide hydrogen bonding in the absence of steric hindrance is essentially independent of the angles defining the hydrogen bond.

"The sign of the 1Lb Cotton effects (CEs) from about 240 to 270 nm in the circular dichroism (CD) of enantiomers of chiral benzylcarbinamines and benzylcarbinols is correlated with their absolute configurations using the benzene sector rule and a consideration of the equilibrium between their two conformers of lowest energy and of oppositely signed rotatory powers. For chiral benzylalkylcarbinamines, carbinamine salts, and carbinols, which show a single sign for their 1Lb CEs, a shift in the conformational equilibrium can explain a sign reversal of the CEs with a change in solvent, (R)-2-amino-1-phenylpropane showing negative 1Lb CEs in methanol but positive ones in cyclohexane. l-Phenylalanine in water shows positive 1Lb CEs, but in methanol it shows both negative and positive CD maxima. In methanol, the two longest wavelength maxima comprise a double CE associated with the band origin absorption maximum at 267 nm, the conformational equilibrium shifted from the positive conformer of l-phenylalanine to its negative one and the greater amount of the latter is now detected at slightly longer wavelength in the CD spectrum.

"Here we report the first detailed study of a Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder (DA) reaction that is catalyzed by Lewis acids in water. The effect of Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions as Lewis acid catalysts on the rate and endo\xe2\x88\x92exo selectivity of the DA reaction between the bidentate dienophiles 3-phenyl-1-(2-pyridyl)-2-propen-1-ones (1a\xe2\x88\x92e) and cyclopentadiene (2) in water has been studied. Relative to the uncatalyzed reaction in acetonitrile, catalysis by 0.010 M Cu(NO3)2 in water accelerates the reaction by a factor of 79\xe2\x80\x89300. The kinetics of the catalyzed reaction were analyzed in terms of equilibrium constants for complexation of the Lewis acid with 1a\xe2\x88\x92e and rate constants for the reaction of the resulting complexes with 2. The rate enhancement imposed upon the uncatalyzed DA reaction of substrates 1 with 2 by water is much more pronounced than that for the catalyzed reaction. The increase of the endo\xe2\x88\x92exo selectivity induced by water in the uncatalyzed process is completely absent for the Lewis acid catalyzed reaction. The modest solvent and substituent effects observed for the catalyzed reaction indicate that the change in charge separation during the activation process is not larger than the corresponding change for the uncatalyzed reaction.

"Nafion resin, a perfluorinated ion-exchange polymer, has been used as a heterogeneous strong acid catalyst for a range of reactions; however, in nonpolar solvents or for gas phase reactions the activity is limited due to the extremely low surface area of the polymer beads (<0.02 m2 g-1). In this paper we describe a novel nanocomposite of Nafion resin, in which small (20\xe2\x88\x9260 nm diameter) Nafion resin particles are entrapped within a porous silica network. This material combines the excellent solid acid catalyst properties of Nafion resin with the desirable porous support characteristics of silica. BET surface area is typically in the range of 150\xe2\x88\x92500 m2 g-1 for the composite. Assuming the Nafion resin particles are dense spheres we estimate the effective surface area of the Nafion resin alone to be in the range of 153 (20 nm spheres) to 50 (60 nm spheres) m2 g-1. This new material has been developed using an in situ sol\xe2\x88\x92gel technique wherein solutions of Nafion resin are mixed with soluble silicon sources to form a gel, which is dried to a clear hard glass-like material. These new porous nanocomposites offer the potential for significantly enhanced activity due to the increased accessibility of the Nafion resin-based acid sites. We show examples of catalytic reactions in which the activity per unit weight of Nafion resin has been found to be at least 100 times higher in the composite than the pure polymer. "
"1-(tert-Butylperoxy)-1,2-benziodoxol-3(1H)-one (1a) oxidizes benzyl and allyl ethers to the esters at room temperature in benzene or cyclohexane in the presence of alkali metal carbonates. Since this reaction is compatible with other protecting groups such as MOM, THP, and TBDMS ethers, and acetoxy groups, and because esters are readily hydrolyzed under basic conditions, this new method provides a convenient and effective alternative to the usual reductive deprotection. Oxidation with 1a occurs readily with C\xe2\x88\x92H bonds activated by both enthalpic effects (benzylic, allylic, and propargylic C\xe2\x88\x92H bonds) and/or polar effects (\xce\xb1-oxy C\xe2\x88\x92H bonds), generating \xce\xb1-oxy carbon-centered radicals, which can be detected by nitroxyl radical trapping. Measurement of the relative rates of oxidation for a series of ring-substituted benzyl n-butyl ethers 2d and 2p\xe2\x88\x92s indicated that electron-releasing groups such as p-MeO and p-Me groups increase the rate of oxidation, and Hammett correlation of the relative rate factors with the \xcf\x83+ constants of substituents afforded the reaction constant \xcf\x81+ = \xe2\x88\x920.30. The large value of the isotope effect obtained for the oxidation of benzyl n-butyl ether 2d (kH/kD = 12\xe2\x88\x9214) indicates that the rate-determining step of the reactions probably involves a high degree of benzylic C\xe2\x88\x92H bond breaking. The effects of molecular dioxygen were examined, and the mechanism involving the intermediacy of the tert-butylperoxy acetal 5 and/or the hydroperoxy acetal 32 is proposed. Particularly noteworthy is the finding that (tert-butylperoxy)iodane 1a can generate the tert-butylperoxy radical and the iodine-centered radical 33a, even at room temperature in solution, via homolytic bond cleavage of the hypervalent iodine(III)\xe2\x88\x92peroxy bond.

"Tin(II) tungstophosphate and tungstosilicate derivatives [SnII3(\xce\xb1-PW9O34)2]12- (1), [SnII3(\xce\xb1-SiW9O34)2]14- (2), and [SnII3(\xce\xb2-SiW9O34)2]14- (3) have been prepared by reaction of tin(II) sulfate with Na8H[A,\xce\xb2-PW9O34]\xc2\xb724H2O, Na10[\xce\xb1-SiW9O34]\xc2\xb7xH2O, and Na10[\xce\xb2-SiW9O34]\xc2\xb726H2O, respectively. Oxidation of 1 with Br2 yields [(HOSnIVOH)3(PW9O34)2]12- (1\xe2\x80\x98). The new heteropolyanions were characterized by elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, multinuclear NMR, and X-ray crystallography. Crystals of Cs11H[SnII3(PW9O34)2]\xc2\xb714H2O (anion 1) are triclinic, space group P1\xcc\x84, with lattice constants a = 12.904(3) \xc3\x85, b = 18.059(3) \xc3\x85, c = 21.618(3) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb1 = 111.68(2)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb2 = 94.04(2)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb3 = 101.41(1)\xc2\xb0, V = 4531.5(14) \xc3\x853, Z = 2. Crystals of Cs12.5H1.5[SnII3(\xce\xb1-SiW9O34)2]\xc2\xb724.5H2O (anion 2) are triclinic, space group P1\xcc\x84, with lattice constants a = 13.101(5) \xc3\x85, b = 18.140(7) \xc3\x85, c = 21.367(8) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb1 = 111.54(4)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb2 = 92.22(4)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb3 = 102.98(2)\xc2\xb0, V = 4561(3) \xc3\x853, Z = 2. Both 1 and 2 have structures in which three SnII cations are sandwiched between XW9 units. In 1 the coordination of each Sn is trigonal bipyramidal with the \xe2\x80\x9cequatorial\xe2\x80\x9d unshared electron pair directed toward the center of the anion. The inequality of the equatorial (2.11 \xc3\x85) and axial (2.33 \xc3\x85) Sn\xe2\x88\x92O bond lengths results in one PW9 group being rotated by 7\xc2\xb0 with respect to the other PW9. The overall anion symmetry is D3. Anion 2 has a more pronounced (10\xc2\xb0) rotation of the SiW9 groups, which results in \xe2\x80\x9ctetrahedral\xe2\x80\x9d Sn coordination, again with the unshared electron pairs directed internally (overall anion symmetry C3). The greater rotation in the structure of 2 may be a consequence of electrostatic repulsions between the more highly charged SiW9O3410- anions. All three anions display one-line 119Sn-NMR and two-line 183W-NMR (intensity 1:2) spectra, although the lines are broad (60\xe2\x88\x92100 Hz) for 2 and 3 suggesting a slow fluxional process, probably racemization via an internal twist. In contrast, the two W-NMR lines of 1 are narrow and the more intense line shows two-bond coupling to P (1.7 Hz). This line is split into two by the addition of the chiral amino acids lysine, isoleucine, and histidine, but is unaffected by achiral glycine. Crystals of a lysine complex have been isolated, but have in all cases so far proved to be disordered. "
"Molecular solids comprised of octahedra, hexagonal plates, and truncated icosahedra result from the co-crystallization of Pd6Cl12, benzene and its methylated derivatives, and C60. Solutions of bis(benzonitrile)palladium(II) dichloride in benzene deposit deep red crystals of solvate-free Pd6Cl12, 1, while solutions of bis(benzonitrile)palladium(II) dichloride in the following solvents or solutions produce binary or ternary compounds as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 from mesitylene, Pd6Cl12\xc2\xb7(CH3)3C6H3 (2); from mesitylene/benzene, Pd6Cl12\xc2\xb7(CH3)3C6H3\xc2\xb70.5C6H6 (3); from durene/benzene, Pd6Cl12\xc2\xb7(CH3)4C6H2 (4); from benzene/hexamethylbenzene, Pd6Cl12\xc2\xb71.5(CH3)6C6 (5); from benzene/biphenyl, Pd6Cl12\xc2\xb7(C6H5)2 (6); and from benzene/fullerene C60, Pd6Cl12\xc2\xb70.5C60\xc2\xb71.5C6H6 (7). The geometric structures of each of these seven compounds have been determined by X-ray crystallography, and the electronic structure of Pd6Cl12 has been probed with SCF\xe2\x88\x92X\xce\xb1\xe2\x88\x92SW calculations. In each crystalline compound the structure of the Pd6Cl12 unit is virtually invariant. It consists of an octahedral array of six palladium atoms that are surrounded by twelve equivalent chlorine atoms in edge-bridging sites. The long face-to-face Pd\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Pd separations (4.675 \xc3\x85 in 1) indicate that there is no direct Pd\xe2\x88\x92Pd bonding in the cluster. In 1 these octahedra interact with one another through pairwise Pd\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Cl contacts. In 2, 3, 4, and 6, layer-like structures are found in which each Pd6Cl12 cluster makes face-to-face contact with an arene moiety on opposite PdCl4 faces and each arene makes contact with two Pd6Cl12 clusters. In these four compounds, the clusters also make contact with each other through pairwise Pd\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Cl contacts that are like those found in 1. The structure of Pd6Cl12\xc2\xb71.5(CH3)6C6 (5) is unique in that three hexamethylbenzene molecules make face-to-face contact with orthogonal faces of the Pd6Cl12 cluster and the cluster\xe2\x88\x92cluster separations are larger than those in 1\xe2\x88\x924 and 6. The structure of Pd6Cl12\xc2\xb70.5C60\xc2\xb71.5C6H6 (7) consists of a complex array of molecular components with face-to-face contacts between the benzene molecules and both C60 and Pd6Cl12. Pd6Cl12 itself dissolves in aromatic solvents. The electronic spectra of the resulting solutions show variations that are indicative of a degree of charge transfer between the Pd6Cl12 cluster as an electron acceptor and the arene as an electron donor.

"Alternating current (ac) magnetic susceptibility data are presented for six distorted cubane complexes of the composition [MnIVMnIII3O3X]. Each of these complexes has a well isolated S = 9/2 ground state. There is zero-field splitting (ZFS) in the ground states where D, the axial ZFS parameter, is found to be in the range of \xe2\x88\x920.27 to \xe2\x88\x920.38 cm-1. As a result of the big spin ground state and appreciable magnetic anisotropy, an out-of-phase ac magnetic susceptibility signal is seen for each of the six Mn4 complexes. The out-of-phase ac susceptibility signal reflects slow magnetization relaxation which is taken to indicate that individual molecules are acting as magnets. Alternating current susceptibility data are presented for a frozen glass of one of the Mn4 complexes to confirm that the out-of-phase ac signal is associated with isolated molecules. The factors that influence whether a given complex can function as a single-molecule magnet are described. The above Mn4 complexes represent only the second type of molecules that exhibit enough magnetic anisotropy to function as single-molecule magnets. "
"Low-temperature optical absorption, circular dichroism, magnetic circular dichroism, and sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption spectra have been measured for the green \xe2\x80\x9cblue\xe2\x80\x9d copper center (type 1) in Achromobacter cycloclastes nitrite reductase. Combined with density functional calculations, the results of these spectroscopies have been used to define the extremely \xe2\x80\x9cperturbed\xe2\x80\x9d electronic structure of this site relative to that of the prototypical \xe2\x80\x9cclassic\xe2\x80\x9d site found in plastocyanin. Experimentally calibrated density functional calculations have been further used to determine the specific geometric distortions which generate the perturbed electronic structure. These studies indicate that the principal electronic structure changes in nitrite reductase, relative to plastocyanin, are a rotation of the Cu dx2-y2 half-filled, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and an increase in the ligand field strength at the Cu center. The HOMO rotation increases the pseudo-\xcf\x83 interaction and decreases the \xcf\x80 interaction of the cysteine (Cys) sulfur with Cu dx2-y2. Furthermore, significant methionine (Met) sulfur character is mixed into the HOMO due to increased overlap with Cu dx2-y2. These changes in Cu\xe2\x88\x92ligand interactions result in the redistribution of absorption intensity in the charge transfer and ligand field transitions. Additionally, the new S(Met)\xe2\x88\x92Cu interaction accounts for the unexpectedly high sulfur covalency in the HOMO. The increase in ligand field strength shifts all the d \xe2\x86\x92 d transitions in nitrite reductase to \xe2\x88\xbc1000 cm-1 higher energy than their counterparts in plastocyanin, which accounts for the EPR spectral differences between the type 1 sites in these complexes. The geometric distortion primarily responsible for the electronic structure changes in nitrite reductase, relative to plastocyanin, is determined to involve a coupled angular movement of the Cys and Met residues toward a more flattened tetrahedral (toward square planar) structure. This movement is consistent with a tetragonal Jahn\xe2\x88\x92Teller distortion resulting from the shorter Cu\xe2\x88\x92S(Met) bond in nitrite reductase relative to plastocyanin. This increased Jahn\xe2\x88\x92Teller distortion implies that the type 1 site is \xe2\x80\x9cless entatic\xe2\x80\x9d than that in plastocyanin. "
"The hexahomotrioxacalix[3]arene macrocycles 1 are observed to bind trivalent metals (Sc3+, Lu3+,Y3+, La3+) more strongly than alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+).

Periodic trends in the structures and dynamic behavior of the complexes are discussed. "
"We studied the molecular dynamics of vanadyl\xe2\x88\x92chelate complexes covalently attached to the surface of cascade polymers, dendrimers. The rotational correlation times of the ion\xe2\x88\x92chelate complex were determined from computer simulations of their EPR spectra. The chelate 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-6-methyldiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid was covalently attached to ammonia core poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) cascade polymers via a thiourea (TU) linkage, resulting in PAMAM\xe2\x88\x92TU\xe2\x88\x92DTPA cascade polymers. X-band EPR spectra of their vanadyl complexes were taken, and the A and g matrices were determined from the rigid limit spectra using the SIMPOW program. Spectra were fitted with modification of the slow-motional line-shape theory. Our results indicate that the rotational correlation times of the surface chelate increase with molecular weight and resemble those of \xe2\x80\x9cinternal\xe2\x80\x9d segmental motions found in PAMAMs. For this macromolecular system, the rotational correlation times alone cannot account for differences in the relaxivity between high and moderate molecular weight species. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the differences between linear-based and cascade polymer-based MRI contrast agents in the response of their relaxivity to molecular weight partially result from differing responses of their rotational correlation time to increases in molecular weight. A comparison of isotropic and anisotropic tumbling models indicates anisotropic tumbling of the ion\xe2\x88\x92chelate complex at physiological temperatures, which is consistent with a model that incorporates segmental motions of the dendrimer side chains.

"The nitrogen inversion barriers for N-isopropyl-, N-butyl-, N-isobutyl-, and N-tert-butyl-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes were measured using dynamic NMR line shape analysis. These barriers as well as those for different bicyclic and tricyclic tertiary amines were analyzed via the molecular mechanics method (MM3 force field). A new MM3 steric energy-based parameter, including the energy of substitution-induced disturbances (Esid), is proposed for the estimation of relative strain among related compounds with one variable substituent. A linear relationship was found between N-inversion barriers and this parameter for 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes with a \xce\xb2-unbranched N-substituent, which allows an accurate prediction of the barrier values for these amines. For all polycyclic systems studied, the change of strain in the transition state relative to the ground state of the amine, simulated by MM3, makes up 76\xe2\x88\x92106% of the experimental value of the corresponding N-inversion barrier. Among these amines some azabicycles (\xe2\x80\x9cbicyclic effect\xe2\x80\x9d systems) display the largest deviation (\xe2\x88\xbc25%) from the experimental barrier value. From the point of view of the classical model, this deviation may be attributed to a bicyclic effect which would have an orbital origin. "
"We report on the electron-spin-echo decay of triplet [2-2H]dodecapentaenal in stretched polyethylene films. Deuterium nuclear-spin-induced modulations have been observed and analyzed, and a value of 0.12 \xc2\xb1 0.01 is found for the spin density on the carbon atom at position 2. The agreement of this value with that calculated by semiempirical molecular-orbital methods provides the basis for a discussion of the spin-density distribution along the conjugated carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon chain of polyenes in the lowest triplet state.

"Adsorption of benzene on well-ordered Rh(111) and Pt(111) electrodes was investigated in HF solution using in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Ordered adlayers of adsorbed benzene with a c(2\xe2\x88\x9a3 \xc3\x97 3)rect-2C6H6 (\xce\xb8 = 0.17) symmetry were found to form on both electrodes in the double-layer charging region. A phase transition was observed in the benzene adlayer at negative potentials, where partial desorption of adsorbed benzene took place. The c(2\xe2\x88\x9a3 \xc3\x97 3)rect structure was transformed into (3 \xc3\x97 3)-1C6H6 (\xce\xb8 = 0.11) and (\xe2\x88\x9a21 \xc3\x97 \xe2\x88\x9a21)R10.9\xc2\xb0 (\xce\xb8 = 0.14) on Rh(111) and Pt(111), respectively. High-resolution STM images obtained on Rh(111) revealed the internal structures of benzene molecules adsorbed at different binding sites in both phases. They appeared as triangular and dumbbell shapes in the (3 \xc3\x97 3) and c(2\xe2\x88\x9a3 \xc3\x97 3)rect structures, respectively, implying their 3-fold and 2-fold registries. The 2-fold bridging coordination was thought to occur in the (\xe2\x88\x9a21 \xc3\x97 \xe2\x88\x9a21)R10.9\xc2\xb0 phase on Pt(111). "
"Amorphous precursors, like MoS3 (WS3), were shown before to be an ideal precursor for the growth of inorganic fullerene-like material in a rather slow crystallization process which lasts anything from 1 h at 800\xe2\x88\x92900 \xc2\xb0C1,2 to a few years at ambient conditions.3,4 Using a few microsecond short electrical pulses from the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope, crystallization of amorphous MoS3 (a-MoS3) nanoparticles, which were electrodeposited on a Au substrate into MoS2 nanocrystallites with a fullerene-like structure (IF-MoS2), is demonstrated. The (outer) shell of each nanocrystallite is complete, which suggests that the reaction extinguishes itself upon completion of the crystallization of the MoS2 layers. A completely different mode of crystallization is observed in the case of continuous a-MoS3 films. Here tiny (2\xe2\x88\x923 nm thick) 2H-MoS2 platelets are observed after the electrical pulse, suggesting a very rapid dissipation of the thermal energy through the gold substrate, in the continuous domain. Since the reaction mechanism in both cases is believed to be the same, it is likely that the main stimulus for the chemical reaction/crystallization of the IF material results from the slow heat dissipation from the nanoparticle. The exothermicity of the chemical reaction may further promote the rate of the process. "
"Using ab initio conformational energy mapping (HF/3-21G) a maximum of nine characteristic backbone conformation clusters (\xce\xb1l, \xce\xb1d, \xce\xb2l, \xce\xb3l, \xce\xb3d, \xce\xb4l, \xce\xb4d, \xce\xb5l, and \xce\xb5d) were previously established for different amino acid diamides (e.g., For-l-Ala-NH2, For-l-Val-NH2, and For-l-Phe-NH2). Most of the above nine backbone conformers have been located in the [\xcf\x86,\xcf\x88] space for various side-chain conformers. The present conformation analysis derives structural parameters of For-l-Ser-NH2 molecule based on a systematic investigation of the side-chain conformational energy maps {E = E(\xcf\x871,\xcf\x872)} associated with characteristic backbone structures. The systematic mapping of the E = E(\xcf\x86,\xcf\x88,\xcf\x871,\xcf\x872) four-dimensional Ramachandran-type map has revealed 44 minima. This finding thus established the complete conformational set for For-l-Ser-NH2. Specific intramolecular hydrogen bonds of the 44 geometry optimized structures were analyzed. These ab initio structures can now be used with greater confidence during force field parameterizations, NMR, and X-ray structure elucidations or even for the characterization of protein backbone structures.

"(\xce\xb73-Allyl)palladium complexes possessing various allylic \xce\xb2-substituents (X = Cl, OCH3, H) and ancillary ligands on palladium (L = Cl-, F-, PH3) have been studied at the second-order M\xc3\xb8ller\xe2\x88\x92Plesset (MP2) and fourth-order M\xc3\xb8ller\xe2\x88\x92Plesset (MP4) perturbation theory level including single, double, and quadruple excitations (MP4SDQ). Interactions between the \xce\xb2-substituents and palladium have been analyzed as a function of the conformation and configuration of the complexes. Asymmetric polarization of the electron density by \xce\xb2-substituents leads to significant structural changes of the complexes. The \xce\xb2-substituent effects considerably increase the thermodynamic stability of the complexes and facilitate the heterolytic fission of the C\xe2\x88\x92X bond. The intensity of these effects depends on the nature of the \xce\xb2-substituent, on the conformation and configuration of the complex, as well as on the \xcf\x83-donor/\xcf\x80-acceptor character of the ancillary ligands on palladium. Since (\xce\xb73-allyl)palladium complexes are key intermediates of some important palladium catalyzed transformations, the \xce\xb2-substituent effects on the regiochemistry of the nucleophilic attack are also discussed. It was concluded that the regioselection is considerably enhanced in the presence of strong \xce\xb2-substituent effects. "
"A new methodology, affinity capillary electrophoresis\xe2\x88\x92mass spectrometry (ACE-MS), is introduced as a solution-based approach for screening combinatorial libraries for drug leads. The method allows on-line, one-step selection and structural identification of candidate ligands. ACE-MS is demonstrated using the binding of vancomycin to libraries of all-d-tri- and tetrapeptides as a model system. Peptide libraries of different forms of Fmoc-DDXX and Fmoc-EXX containing up to 361 compounds were successfully employed to determine interacting structural motifs. A consensus structure of the strongest interacting peptides consisted of d-Ala at the C-terminus and an aromatic amino acid in the penultimate position. Ligands with this structure bound more strongly to the receptor than the known ligand, d-Ala-d-Ala. A 1000 peptide library was also screened directly by ACE-MS. It was found that, for this and potentially larger libraries, incorporating an affinity solid phase extraction step prior to ACE-MS was effective in both removing a large number of non-interacting species as well as preconcentrating sample components for sequence determination by MS.

"A computational and experimental study of the unsymmetrical 2c\xe2\x88\x923e bond in [Et2S\xe2\x88\xb4SMe2]+ is presented. For the first time, MS/MS collision-induced dissociation experiments provide strong experimental support of the atomic connectivity in a gas-phase S\xe2\x88\xb4S 2c\xe2\x88\x923e association adduct. The strongest peak in the collision-induced dissociation spectrum corresponds to Et2S+, consistent with the lower ionization potential of Et2S compared to Me2S and the proposed structure. High-pressure equilibrium mass spectrometry experiments yield a reaction enthalpy of \xe2\x88\x92104 kJ/mol for the equilibrium reaction Et2S+ + Me2S \xe2\x87\x84 [Et2S\xe2\x88\xb4SMe2]+ at 506 K. Correcting this value to 0 K using ab initio molecular parameters results in a bond energy of 107 kJ/mol which can be compared to a calculated value of 107.9 kJ/mol at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)//B3LYP/6-31G(d)+ZPC level. Studies on a competing reaction, Et2S+ + Et2S \xe2\x87\x84 [Et2S\xe2\x88\xb4SEt2]+, yield an experimental bond enthalpy of 119 kJ/mol at 506 K and a calculated bond energy of 121.3 kJ/mol, in excellent agreement with previously reported values.

"A number of functionalized \xce\xb3,\xce\xb4-unsaturated chromium carbene complexes were synthesized, and their photochemistry was studied. Photolysis of carbene complexes 5 and 17 induced intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition to afford cyclobutanones 6 and 18, respectively. If the photoreactions were not run in thoroughly degassed solvents, small amounts of lactones 7 and 19 were obtained as well. Cyclobutanones 6 and 18 were stable once isolated, but underwent an acid-catalyzed Pinacol rearrangement/hydrolysis transformation in acidic solution to afford novel \xce\xb1-hydroxy-substituted bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanone compounds 20 and 21. Photolysis of cyclopropyl carbene complex 28 induced a vinylcyclopropyl rearrangement involving the photogenerated ketene moiety to provide \xce\xb1-alkoxy cyclopentenone 29. "
"The \xce\xb1V\xce\xb23-receptor, one member of the integrin family, is implicated in angiogenesis and in human tumor metastasis. Spatial screening led to the highly active first-generation peptide c(RGDfV), which shows a \xce\xb2II\xe2\x80\x98/\xce\xb3-turn arrangement with d-Phe in the i + 1 position of the \xce\xb2II\xe2\x80\x98-turn. Further reduction of the flexibility should be achieved by incorporating different rigid building blocks (turn mimetics) like the (S)- and (R)-Gly[ANC-2]Leu dipeptide, the \xce\xb2-turn dipeptide (BTD) and the (S,S)-spiro-Pro-Leu moiety. These distinct \xce\xb2-turn mimetics are introduced by replacing the d-Phe-Val dipeptide in the lead structure c(RGDfV). In peptide analogues c(RGD\xe2\x80\x9cS-ANC\xe2\x80\x9d) (PA1), c(RGD\xe2\x80\x9cR-ANC\xe2\x80\x9d) (PA2), and c(RGD\xe2\x80\x9cBTD\xe2\x80\x9d) (PA3) the turn mimetic does not adopt the desired position in the \xce\xb2-turn, instead Gly occupies the i + 1 position of the \xce\xb2II\xe2\x80\x98-turn. Only c(RGD\xe2\x80\x9cspiro\xe2\x80\x9d) PA4 led to the desired \xce\xb2II\xe2\x80\x98/\xce\xb3-turn arrangement with the turn motif in the i + 1 and i + 2 position of the \xce\xb2-turn. These effects may arise from particular steric effects of the cyclic pentapeptide system in combination with steric requirements of the ANC and BTD moiety. Additional investigations on cyclic hexapeptide derivatives show that the BTD occupies the expected i + 1 and i + 2 position of a \xce\xb2II\xe2\x80\x98-turn in these systems. Structure\xe2\x88\x92activity investigations showed that the incorporation of the rigid turn motifs could not reduce the flexibility of the RGD site (ANC and BTD) or fix a conformation which is unable to match the receptor very well (spiro). On the other hand, recent findings that the proton of the amide bond between Asp and the following amino acid is essential for high activity can be confirmed. Moreover, the synthesis of c(RGD\xe2\x80\x9cR-ANC\xe2\x80\x9d) PA2 led to one of the compounds most active in inhibiting vitronectin binding to the \xce\xb1V\xce\xb23-integrin. "
"Complementary short-strand DNA homooligomers and guanidinium-linked homonucleosides associate and form triplexes in solution. The melting temperatures, Tm, the association and dissociation kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, and activation energies were determined by UV thermal analysis for the triplexes of short strand DNA homooligomers {d(pA)5-d(pA)12-18} and poly(dA) with the guanidinium-linked nucleoside d(Tg)4-T-azido {DNG5}. The melting and cooling curves exhibit hysteresis behavior in the temperature range of 5\xe2\x88\x9295 \xc2\xb0C at 0.2 deg/min thermal rate. From these curves the rate constants and the energies of activation for association (kon, Eon) and dissociation (koff, Eoff) processes were obtained. The Tm decreases with the ionic strength and increases slightly with increase in concentration of the monomers. A greater increase in the Tm results from an increase in the length of the DNA strand d(pA)x. In the case of d(pA)5 and d(pA)6, triplexes are formed, with Tm = 34 and 39 \xc2\xb0C, respectively, only above 0.063 mM/(adenine base) concentration when ionic strength is 0.08. The rate constants kon and koff at a reference temperature (288 K) are dependent on the DNA strand length and also decrease and increase respectively with the ionic strength. The energies of activation for the association and dissociation processes are in the range of \xe2\x88\x9210 to \xe2\x88\x9250 and 17 to 44 kcal/mol, respectively. The equilibrium for the formation of the triplexes {(d(Tg)4-T-azido)2\xc2\xb7d(pA)x, x = 5\xe2\x88\x9210)} is favored by several orders of magnitude when compared to the triplexes of DNA. The standard molar enthalpies for triplex formation have larger negative values at low ionic strength than at high ionic strength indicating that at lower \xce\xbc values the formation of triplexes of d(Tg)4-T-azido with d(pA)x is more favored. The values of \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0(288) calculated from the activation parameters are between \xe2\x88\x9230 and \xe2\x88\x9260 kcal/(mol base) and the values of \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0(288) are between \xe2\x88\x928 and \xe2\x88\x9213 kcal/(mol base) for short-strand DNA. There is a linear relationship in the enthalpy\xe2\x88\x92entropy compensation for the triplex-melting thermodynamics. "
"A series of zirconium and lanthanide metallocene catalysts are active in the regioselective ring-opening polymerization of strained exo-methylenecycloalkanes to yield exo-methylene-functionalized polyethylenes. MCB (methylenecyclobutane) affords the polymer [CH2CH2CH2C(CH2)]n under the catalytic action of (1,2-Me2Cp)2ZrMe+MeB(C6F5)3-, and MCP (methylenecyclopropane) affords the polymer [CH2CH2C(CH2)]n under the catalytic action of [(Me5Cp)2LuH]2. Reversible deactivation of the [(Me5Cp)2LuH]2 catalyst is observed in the MCP polymerization reaction and is ascribed to formation of a Lu-allyl species based on D2O quenching experiments. In contrast, the catalysts [(Me5Cp)2SmH]2 and [(Me5Cp)2LaH]2 yield the dimer 1,2-dimethylene-3-methylcyclopentane (DMP) from MCP with high chemoselectivity. The mechanism of dimerization is proposed to involve the intermediacy of 3-methylene-1,6-heptadiene (MHD) and is supported by the observation that independently synthesized MHD is smoothly converted to DMP under catalytic conditions. (Me5Cp)2ZrMe+MeB(C6F5)3- catalyzes the polymerization of MCP to a polyspirane consisting of 1,3-interlocked five-membered rings (poly(1,4:2,2-butanetetrayl), (C4H6)n). From end group analysis, the reaction pathway is proposed to consist of \xce\xb2-alkyl shift-based ring-opening followed by an intramolecular insertive, ring-closing \xe2\x80\x9czipping-up\xe2\x80\x9d process. AM1-level computations indicate that the zipping-up reaction is exothermic by \xe2\x88\xbc16 kcal/(mol of ring closure). Under the same catalytic conditions, the monomers methylenecyclopentane, methylenecyclohexane, and 2-methylenenorbornane undergo double bond migration (to the adjacent internal position) rather than polymerization. In contrast to the relatively restrictive requirements for homopolymerization, MCB-ethylene copolymerization is catalyzed by a wide variety of zirconocenium catalysts, including those generated conveniently from MAO, to afford high molecular weight {[CH2CH2]x[CH2CH2CH2C(CH2)]y}n copolymers with the incorporated MCB having an exclusively ring-opened microstructure. The activity of the catalysts in incorporating MCB into the polymer chain follows the order:\xe2\x80\x89 Cp2ZrMe+ > (1,2-Me2Cp)2ZrMe+ \xe2\x89\xab (Me5Cp)2ZrMe+, regardless of the counteranion identity. Labeling experiments with 13CH213CH2 confirm that MCB ring-opening occurs with C2\xe2\x88\x92C3, C2\xe2\x88\x92C5 bond scission. MCP-ethylene copolymerization to yield high molecular weight {[CH2CH2]x[CH2CH2C(CH2)]y} having an exclusively ring-opened microstructure is catalyzed by [(Me5Cp)2LuH]2 and [(Me5Cp)2SmH]2. When [(Me5Cp)2LaH]2 is used as the catalyst, more than 50% of the MCP is located at the chain ends in a dienyl structure. The only zirconium polymerization catalyst which incorporates MCP in the ring-opened form in a moderate percentage is [(Me4CpSiMe2(NtBu)]ZrMe+ B(C6F5)4-. The activity of d0/fn catalysts in incorporating MCP into the polymer follows the order:\xe2\x80\x89 [(Me4CpSiMe2(NtBu)]ZrMe+B(C6F5)4- > [(Me5Cp)2LuH]2 > [(Me5Cp)2SmH]2 > [(Me5Cp)2LaH]2. "
"A small streptavidin-binding ligand was identified which incorporates some of the binding interactions seen in the crystal structures of streptavidin\xe2\x88\x92biotin, and of streptavidin complexed with cyclo-Ac-[CHPQFC]-NH2, a cyclic peptide ligand with a Kd of 2.3 \xc3\x97 10-7 M, discovered by phage display. The crystal structure of streptavidin\xe2\x88\x92glycoluril is described and compared with the crystal structures of streptavidin\xe2\x88\x92biotin and of streptavidin\xe2\x88\x92cyclo-Ac-[CHPQFC]-NH2. The Kd of glycoluril for streptavidin was determined by plasmon resonance measurements to be 2.5 \xc3\x97 10-6 M. The differences in the affinities of biotin and glycoluril for streptavidin were related to the differences in the crystal structures of the complexes and to differences in the determined solubilities of the ligands. Streptavidin-bound glycoluril has structural characteristics of, and makes interactions common to, both bound biotin and the bound cyclic peptide ligand. Binding of glycoluril and biotin is mediated by short, medium strength hydrogen bonds involving the ureido oxygen common to the two ligands. Binding of glycoluril is further mediated by a short hydrogen bond involving its unique ureido oxygen. The structural and physicochemical factors responsible for the weaker binding of glycoluril compared with biotin are discussed. "
"Base-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification in uridine 3\xe2\x80\x98-(aryl phosphorothioate)s (Up(S)Ar) has been studied with respect to the dependence on the acidity of the conjugate acid of the leaving aryloxy group (pKa 7.1\xe2\x88\x9210) as well as on the basicity of the catalyst (pKa(BH) = 7\xe2\x88\x9210.2). The synthesis of the studied phosphorothioates was accomplished by using a method based on condensation of a protected uridine 3\xe2\x80\x98-H-phosphonate with the appropriate phenols. The rate constants for hydroxide and imidazole catalysis (25 \xc2\xb0C, 0.25 M ionic strength) obey Br\xc3\xb8nsted linear free energy relationships and the obtained \xce\xb2leaving\xe2\x80\x89group (\xce\xb2lg) values are \xe2\x88\x920.55 and \xe2\x88\x920.63, respectively. General-base-catalyzed release of 4-nitrophenoxide from the corresponding phosphorothioate also obeys a Br\xc3\xb8nsted relationship with respect to the basicity of the catalyst (\xce\xb2 = 0.59). Rates of reactions of the phosphorothioates are somewhat lower than for the corresponding phosphates (k(UpAr)/k(SP-Up(S)Ar) \xe2\x89\x88 1.7\xe2\x88\x923.6 and k(UpAr)/k(RP-Up(S)Ar) \xe2\x89\x88 1.2\xe2\x88\x922.6 (the spatial arrangement of phosphorus ligands in the SP isomer of Up(S)Ar are the same as in the RP isomer of a dinucleotide). Leffler \xce\xb1 values of 0.59 for proton abstraction and 0.36 for bond breaking to the leaving group in the transition state do not balance (imbalance in \xce\xb1 = 0.23), indicating some negative charge buildup on the central group of atoms in the transition state. The intramolecular transesterification in uridine 3\xe2\x80\x98-(aryl phosphorothioate)s is considered to be a concerted associative process with a mechanism that is similar to that in the corresponding phosphate esters, the difference being that the transition state appears to have a slightly more dissociative character for the phosphorothioates.

"The syntheses of ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP with deuterium labels on the 3\xe2\x80\x98, 4\xe2\x80\x98, and 5\xe2\x80\x98 carbons (2\xe2\x88\x925) is described. A combination of chemical and enzymatic synthesis is used where d,l-ribose-3,4,5,5\xe2\x80\x98-d4 (\xc2\xb11) is first produced from glycerol-d8 by chemical methods, and then the four 3\xe2\x80\x98,4\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-labeled NTPs (2\xe2\x88\x925) are prepared from (\xe2\x88\x921) using enzymes from the purine salvage and pyrimidine biosynthetic metabolic pathways. New procedures were developed for the large scale preparation of GTP and CTP, and existing procedures were modified for the preparation of ATP and UTP. A 30-nucleotide RNA derived from the HIV-2 TAR RNA was prepared with unlabeled NTPs and deuterated NTPs (2\xe2\x88\x925) to illustrate the dramatic effects of deuteration on the NMR spectra of RNA. The NOESY spectra of the deuterated RNA exhibits greatly reduced spectral crowding compared to that of the unlabeled RNA, and assignment of NOEs to the H2\xe2\x80\x98 protons is simplified due to the specific deuteration pattern. Also, the nonselective T1 and T2 relaxation rates were measured for the deuterated RNA and found to be approximately twice as long as the T1 and T2 relaxation rates of the unlabeled RNA. The spectral simplification and improved relaxation properties of the deuterated RNA should prove useful in the study of large RNAs by NMR. "
"Infrared microspectroscopy has been developed as a powerful, nondestructive technique for the quantitative analysis of solid-phase, resin-bound chemical reactions.

Calculation of first derivative carbon\xe2\x88\x92deuterium (C\xe2\x88\x92D) stretching absorbance relative to resin backbone derivative absorbances provided pathlength-independent quantitation of deuterium content and allowed for the determination of chemical yields in solid-phase resin reactions involving changes in deuterium content.

"By addressing the relative stereochemistry of the four acyclic portions via organic synthesis, the complete relative stereochemistry of maitotoxin (MTX) has been established as 1B. The relative stereochemistry of the C.1\xe2\x88\x92C.15 portion was elucidated via a two-phase approach:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) the synthesis of the eight diastereomers possible for model C, representing the C.1\xe2\x88\x92C.11 portion, and the eight diastereomers possible for model D, representing the C.11\xe2\x88\x92C.15 portion, and the comparison of their proton and carbon NMR characteristics with those of MTX, concluding that 9 and 35 represent the relative stereochemistry of the corresponding portions of MTX; (2) the synthesis of the two remote diastereomers 51 and 52, and comparison of their proton and carbon NMR characteristics with those of MTX, concluding that 51 represents the relative stereochemistry of the C.1\xe2\x88\x92C.15 portion of MTX. The relative stereochemistry of the C.35\xe2\x88\x92C.39, C.63\xe2\x88\x92C.68, and C.134\xe2\x88\x92C.142 acyclic portions was established via (1) the synthesis of the 8, 8, and 16 diastereomers possible for models E, F, and G, respectively, and (2) the comparison of their proton and carbon NMR characteristics with those of MTX, concluding that 81, 117, and 187, respectively, represent the relative stereochemistry of the corresponding portions of MTX. Some biogenetic considerations have been given to speculate on the absolute configuration of MTX. The vicinal proton coupling constants observed for models 51, 81, 117, and 187 were used to elucidate their preferred solution conformation. Assembling the preferred solution conformations found for the four acyclic portions allows one to suggest that the approximate global conformation of MTX is represented by the shape of a hook, with the C.35\xe2\x88\x92C.39 portion being its curvature. MTX appears to be conformationally relatively rigid, except for conformational flexibility around the C.7\xe2\x88\x92C.9 and C.12\xe2\x88\x92C.14 portions. On the basis of the experimental results gained in the current work, coupled with those in the AAL-toxin/fumonisin area, it has been pointed out that the structural properties of 51, 81, 117, 187 and their diastereomers are inherent to the specific stereochemical arrangement of the small substituents on the carbon backbone and are independent from the rest of the molecule. Thus, it has been suggested that each of these diastereomers has the capacity to install a unique structural characteristic through a specific stereochemical arrangement of substituents on the carbon backbone, and that fatty acids and related classes of compounds may be able to carry specific information and serve as functional materials in addition to structural materials.

"A mathematical model for oxygen exchange out of labeled (e.g., 17O) Na2CrO4 into solvent H2O according to the dimerization reaction 2CrO42- + 2H+ \xe2\x87\x8c (1/Ka(HCrO4\xe2\x88\x92)) 2HCrO4- \xe2\x87\x8c (\xce\xb1/\xce\xb2) Cr2O72- + H2O is described. Two rates of isotopic change are identified:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) a rapid change intimately associated with the attainment of chemical equilibrium, but not identical with it (rate constants \xce\xbd1 and \xce\xbd2, respectively), in which the fractional label in monomeric HCrO4- + CrO42- (p) decreases more rapidly than that in the dimer Cr2O72- (q), i.e. \xe1\xb9\x97 > q\xcc\x87, followed by (2) a slower decrease in both (q\xcc\x87 > \xe1\xb9\x97) until isotopic equilibrium with the solvent is established, p = q = r (rate constant \xce\xbd3).

Vibrational fine structure is seen in the visible spectrum (C3v symmetry), and integration of the monomeric (HCrO4- + CrO42-) 17O absorption agrees with only four O atoms in HCrO4-. A pH-dependent shift to higher frequency (\xce\xb4CrO42\xe2\x88\x92 = 812 ppm; \xce\xb4HCrO4\xe2\x88\x92 = 860 ppm) is used to give pKa(HCrO4\xe2\x88\x92) = 5.80 (I = 1.0 M, 25 \xc2\xb0C), and comparisons with the integrated Cr2O72- signal (\xce\xb4Cr2O72\xe2\x88\x92 = 1115 ppm) give Kd\'s for dimerization (= \xce\xb1/\xce\xb2) of 81 M-1 (I = 1.0 M) and 132 M-1 (I = 6.0 M), at 25 \xc2\xb0C. Dimerization and hydrolytic rate constants (\xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2) have been obtained under the conditions of the 17O exchange experiments; they are shown to contain spontaneous, buffer, and [H+] and [OH-] contributions in agreement with earlier investigations. 17O exchange out of enriched Na2CrO4 has been followed in aqueous solutions over the concentration range 0.01\xe2\x88\x922.0 M and over the pH range 6.38\xe2\x88\x9213.0 at 25 \xc2\xb0C and constant ionic strength (I = 1.0, 6.0). The dimerization reaction (eq 1) contributes only at the highest Cr(VI) concentration (2.0 M), and then only slightly (i.e., \xe2\x88\xbc10% at pH 7.3). The rate data have been interpreted in terms of the direct exchange paths Cr17O42- + H2O \xe2\x86\x92 (k1) Cr17O3O2- + H217O; HCr17O4- + H2O \xe2\x86\x92 (k2) HCr17O3O- + H217O; H2Cr17O4 + H2O \xe2\x86\x92 (k3) H2Cr17O3O + H217O; Cr217O72- + H2O \xe2\x86\x92 (k4) Cr217O6O2- + H217O, with rate constants k1 = 7.2 \xc3\x97 10-8 M-1 s-1, k2 = 7.6 \xc3\x97 10-4 M-1 s-1, k3 = 1.7 \xc3\x97 105 M-1 s-1 (I = 1.0 M, 25 \xc2\xb0C), and k4 = 4.1 \xc3\x97 10-3 M-1 s-1 (I = 6.0 M, 25 \xc2\xb0C). The monomeric paths (but not the rate constants) agree with those found in an earlier study, but that involving Cr2O72- is new. Rate constants for 17O exchange are compared with those of other substitution reactions of HCrO4- and Cr2O72-. "
"The synthesis and subsequent reduction of the arylboron dihalides 2,6-Mes2C6H3BX2 (X = Cl (1); Br (2)) and 2,6-Trip2C6H3BBr2 (3) (Mes = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2- and Trip = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2-) are described. Treatment of 2 with lithium metal in diethyl ether gave the novel lithium 9-borafluorenyl compounds 4 and 5 (see Scheme 1) in which the boranediyl intermediate has inserted into an o-Me-ring C\xe2\x88\x92C \xcf\x83-bond to form a borafluorenyl structure incorporating boron in a delocalized five-membered ring. Boranediyl insertion into C\xe2\x88\x92C \xcf\x83-bonds, as distinct from boranediyl induced rearrangements involving CC cleavage in delocalized aromatic substrates, is unknown. The main difference between the structures of these products is that 5 is dimerized as a consequence of the reduction in the number of solvating ethers. Reduction of 2 with KC8 led to the isolation of the 9-borafluorenyl \xe2\x80\x9cate\xe2\x80\x9d compounds 6 and 7. These products also result from C\xe2\x88\x92C bond insertion by boron as seen in 4 and 5. However, the delocalization is not observed owing to the addition of hydrogen (presumably from solvent) to the borons affording borate salts. Reduction of 3 with 3 equiv of KC8 furnishes the new \xe2\x80\x9cdiborate\xe2\x80\x9d species 8. This compound features a unique B\xe2\x88\x92B bonded dianionic structure with a long (1.83(2) \xc3\x85) B\xe2\x88\x92B bond which arises from the association of two borate radical anion fragments that have a 9-borafluorenyl structure similar to those described above.

"The two enantiomers (\xce\x94 and \xce\x9b) of Ru(chiragen[X])Cl2, where \xe2\x80\x9cchiragen\xe2\x80\x9d is a tetradentate ligand with a chiral bridging unit between two bipyridine moieties, have been prepared in high yields.

"High resolution carbon-13, fluorine-19, and proton NMR measurements in solutions of the monosubstituted bullvalenes, C10H9X with X = F, CN, and COOH, as function of temperature are reported. The spectra at low temperatures exhibit signals due to more than one isomer (three for X = F and two for X = CN, COOH). On heating the peaks broaden due to bond shift (Cope) rearrangement involving the various isomers. Detailed analysis of the line shapes shows that in all cases interconversion between the four possible isomers must be assumed, even though the concentration of some of them is too weak to be observed. For fluorobullvalene a complete analysis of the interconversion kinetics and equilibria is presented. For cyanobullvalene and bullvalenecarboxylic acid only a semiquantitative analysis of the results was made. "
"Carbon-13 MAS\xe2\x88\x92NMR and X-ray diffraction experiments on solid fluorobullvalene are reported. The compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnam with four symmetry related molecules per unit cell. The crystal consists entirely of isomer 4 (in which the fluorine is bound to the bridgehead carbon). Temperature dependent 1D and 2D NMR exchange experiments reveal the occurrence of two independent dynamic processes, both preserving the crystal order, but on a completely different time scale. The faster of the two processes involves 3-fold jumps about the molecular (pseudo) C3 symmetry axis. Line shape analysis of dynamic 1D MAS spectra yields an Arrhenius rate equation with a pre-exponential factor, AJ = 6.0 \xc3\x97 1017 s-1, and an activation energy, EJ = 21.7 kcal mol-1. The mechanism of this process was confirmed by a rotor synchronized 2D exchange experiment performed with a mixing time of 20 ms. This spectrum exhibits auto cross peaks between spinning side bands of the same types of carbons, but no hetero cross peaks linking different types of carbons. Two-dimensional exchange spectra recorded on a much longer time scale (of the order of seconds) exhibit, in addition, hetero cross peaks between the main and spinning side bands of different types of carbons. These cross peaks can only result from Cope rearrangement involving other isomers of fluorobullvalene as intermediates. It is argued that the dominant mechanism of this process involves the sequence:\xe2\x80\x89 isomer 4 \xe2\x86\x92 isomer 1 \xe2\x86\x92 isomer 3 \xe2\x86\x92 isomer 1 \xe2\x86\x92 isomer 4, where isomers 1 and 3 serve as transient intermediates. Magnetization transfer experiments provide the following estimates for the kinetic parameters of this process, AC = 4.6 \xc3\x97 109 s-1, EC = 14.5 kcal mol-1. "
"Carbon-13 MAS\xe2\x88\x92NMR measurements and the X-ray crystallographic structure of cyanobullvalene (I) and bullvalenecarboxylic acid (II) are reported. The two compounds crystallize as isomer 3 in the triclinic space group P1\xcc\x84. Two-dimensional solid-state NMR exchange experiments indicate the occurrence of bond shift (Cope) rearrangement in both cases. Analysis of the results shows that the process involves isomer 1 as a transient intermediate. The Arrhenius kinetic parameters were determined from the line broadening in the 1D MAS spectra and magnetization transfer experiments as function of temperature, yielding, AC = 1.0 \xc3\x97 1012 s-1, 2.2 \xc3\x97 1012 s-1 and EC = 13.9 kcal mol-1, 14.1 kcal mol-1 for compounds I and II, respectively. A rearrangement process involving isomer 2 as an intermediate may also occur, but it does not result in permutation of atoms and therefore is NMR-invisible. NMR exchange measurements on solid cyclooctatetraene dimer (III) were also carried out; however, on the time scale of up to 1 min no dynamic effects are observed. "
"The amine elimination reaction of Zr(NMe2)4 (2) and (EBI)H2 (1,2-bis(3-indenyl)ethane, 3) in toluene at 100 \xc2\xb0C affords pure rac-(EBI)Zr(NMe2)2 (rac-4, EBI = ethylene-1,2-bis(1-indenyl)) in 68% isolated yield. This reaction proceeds via the rapidly formed mono-indenyl intermediate (\xce\xb75-C9H6CH2CH2C9H7)Zr(NMe2)3 (6) which undergoes reversible intermolecular amine elimination with a second equivalent of 2 to give the binuclear species (\xce\xbc-\xce\xb75,\xce\xb75-EBI){Zr(NMe2)3}2 (5, rac and meso isomers) or reversible intramolecular amine elimination to give either rac-4 or meso-4. The kinetic metallocene product is a 1/1 mixture of rac-4 and meso-4, the thermodynamic product is rac-4, and the meso-4 to rac-4 isomerization is catalyzed by the NMe2H co-product. The rac-4/meso-4 product ratio can be controlled by adjusting the rate of NMe2H removal from the reaction vessel and the steady state concentration of amine in the reaction mixture. The molecular structure of rac-4 has been determined by X-ray crystallography. rac-4 is converted to rac-(EBI)ZrCl2 (rac-1) in high yield by reaction with NMe2H\xc2\xb7HCl (92% isolated) or Me3SiCl (quantitative). The syntheses of 2, rac-4, and rac-1 can be combined in a \xe2\x80\x9cone pot\xe2\x80\x9d synthesis of rac-1 from ZrCl4 in 68% overall yield. Alkylation of rac-4 with AlMe3 affords rac-(EBI)ZrMe2 (rac-7) in 90% isolated yield. rac-4 can be used directly as a catalyst precursor for the isospecific polymerization of propylene. "
"This paper describes the synthesis and characterization of self-assembled second-order nonlinear optical multilayer materials containing the high-hyperpolarizability [(aminophenyl)azo]pyridinium chromophore. The chromophoric multilayers are assembled on clean glass or single-crystal silicon substrates via the following iterative reaction sequence:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) treatment with 4-ClCH2C6H4SiCl3, 3-BrC3H6SiCl3, or 3-IC3H6SiCl3 to afford a self-assembled coupling layer; (2) quaternization of 4-[[4-[N,N-bis(hydroxylethyl)amino]phenyl]azo]pyridine in a \xe2\x80\x9ctopotactic\xe2\x80\x9d fashion to generate an [(aminophenyl)azo]pyridinium chromophore layer; (3) cross-linking with octachlorotrisiloxane to afford a capping layer (which also regenerates surface hydroxyl groups for subsequent layer deposition). The new chromophore precursor 4-[[4-[N,N-bis(hydroxylethyl)-amino]phenyl]azo]pyridine was synthesized by diazotization of 4-aminopyridine followed by coupling with N-phenyldiethanolamine and has been characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, and infrared, UV\xe2\x88\x92vis, and NMR spectroscopies. The chromophoric multilayers have been characterized by X-ray photoelectron and transmission optical spectroscopies, spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray reflectivity, advancing contact angle measurements, and polarized second harmonic generation (SHG). The excellent structural regularity of the chromophoric multilayers is indicated by the linear dependence of the [(aminophenyl)azo]pyridinium chromophore longitudinal HOMO \xe2\x86\x92 LUMO charge-transfer excitation absorbance at 572 nm and the ellipsometry- and X-ray reflectivity-derived multilayer thicknesses on the number of assembled trilayers, while the uniform polar order of the stacked chromophoric multilayers is evidenced by the quadratic dependence of the second harmonic generation intensities on the number of trilayers. The [(aminophenyl)azo]pyridinium multilayers are photochemically stable, have very high structural regularities, and exhibit a second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (\xcf\x87(2)) of \xe2\x88\xbc3.6 \xc3\x97 10-7 esu (\xe2\x88\xbc150 pm/V) at a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm. Finally, atomic force microscopy reveals that the surfaces of the self-assembled multilayers are very smooth (root mean square roughness = 12 \xc3\x85 for a 10 trilayer sample), undoubtedly reflecting the high three-dimensional structural regularities of the individual layers.

"Isolation of the first macroscopic quantities of endohedral holmium metallofullerenes (principally Ho@C82, Ho2@C82, and Ho3@C82 by LD-TOF mass spectrometry) has been accomplished by carbon-arc and preparative HPLC methodologies. The detailed procedure for production and isolation of the metallofullerenes includes a new technique whereby holmium-impregnated electrodes are prepared simply by soaking porous graphite rods in an ethanolic solution of Ho(NO3)3\xc2\xb7xH2O. Monoisotopic 165Ho offers a unique combination of advantages for neutron-activation studies of metallofullerenes, and purified samples containing 165Ho@C82, 165Ho2@C82, and 165Ho3@C82 have been activated by high-flux neutron irradiation (\xce\xa6 = 4 \xc3\x97 1013 n cm-2 s-1) to generate 166Ho metallofullerenes, which undergo \xce\xb2- decay to produce stable 166Er. Chemical workup of the irradiated samples, followed by re-irradiation, has been used to demonstrate that observed decomposition of holmium metallofullerenes is due mainly to \xe2\x80\x9cfast\xe2\x80\x9d neutron damage rather than to holmium atom nuclear recoil (Emax = 200 eV). This implies that metallofullerene damage can be minimized by using neutron fluxes with the highest possible thermal component. A detailed analysis of the neutron-activation results is presented as a prelude to the possible use of neutron-activated metallofullerenes in nuclear medicine. "
"Tautomerization, ionization, and bond dissociations of the insensitive high-energy explosive 5-nitro-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazolone (NTO) were studied by molecular orbital SCF and MP2 theories and with the Becke3LYP hybrid density functional using the 6-31+G* and 6-311+G** basis sets. Energies computed with these methods were compared against accurate G2 energies for the tautomerization, ionization, and bond dissociations of nitromethane. The Becke3LYP and MP2/6-31+G* structures of NTO anion 9 compare well with the reported X-ray structure of the NTO diaminoguanidinium salt. The IR frequencies calculated with Becke3LYP compare well with those observed for crystalline NTO. Two enol tautomers (2 and 4) with 1H-1,2,4-triazole skeletons are only 4 kcal/mol at MP2/6-311+G** (and 9 kcal/mol at Becke3LYP/6-311+G**) less stable than NTO, while the two aci-nitro tautomers (5 and 6) are ca. 30 kcal/mol less stable than NTO. Comparisons of bond lengths, calculated proton chemical shifts, and magnetic susceptibility anisotropies show the enol tautomers are more aromatic than NTO, which accounts for their enhanced stabilities. NTO anion 9 is also more aromatic than NTO, which partly explains its small proton affinity of 321 kcal/mol calculated at Becke3LYP/6-311+G**+ZPE. The estimated N\xe2\x88\x92H and C\xe2\x88\x92NO2 bond dissociation energies for NTO are respectively 93 and 70 kcal/mol, and that for the N\xe2\x88\x92OH bond of the aci-nitro tautomer 5 is 38 kcal/mol. Some possible processes in the initial stages of NTO decomposition are bimolecular hydrogen atom transfers (in the condensed phase), C\xe2\x88\x92NO2 bond homolysis (at high temperatures or under conditions of shock or impact), and homolysis of the N\xe2\x88\x92OH bond in the aci-nitro tautomers.

"Computational studies of the structures and conformational properties of hemicarcerand 2, a model for 1, studied experimentally by Cram et al., and the complexation and decomplexation of guest molecules by this host have been carried out with MACROMODEL/MM3*. Energy minimizations, molecular dynamics, and statistical perturbation theory calculations were performed. Conformational processes in the intrahemispheric bridges (OCH2O) of the host molecule have been shown to be important for the passage of guest molecules in and out of the cavity. This transient gate-opening phenomenon has a significant influence on the complexation of bicyclic guests, while smaller aromatic guests can pass in and out without gate-opening. Constrictive binding is crucial for the isolation of hemicarceplexes, since it provides a kinetic barrier which permits isolation of complexes. The 1:1 complexes of hemicarcerand 2 with bicyclic guests and benzene derivatives were found to be energetically favorable by 12\xe2\x88\x9223 kcal/mol in the gas phase. Nevertheless, only the bicyclic guests and some substituted monocyclics form stable complexes. If guests are too large, kinetic barriers prevent complexation. Aromatic guests with disk-like shapes are predicted to form complexes in solution, but to be unstable because of their low decomplexation energy barriers. "
"Theoretical models and ab initio Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock wave functions are used to investigate the N 1s core level binding energies of N-containing calcined carbonaceous materials. Comparison of calculated and experimental values for a series of test molecules reveals that the N 1s core level shift from one compound to another is mainly originated by initial state effects. This permits a systematic study of different situations and allows establishment that three different types of nonoxidized N atoms can be present in these materials. These are \xe2\x80\x9cpyridinic\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cpyrrolic\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cgraphitic\xe2\x80\x9d nitrogen with binding energies of \xe2\x89\x88399.0, \xe2\x89\x88400.3, and \xe2\x89\x88401\xe2\x88\x92403 eV, respectively. This assignment is in very good agreement with a recent experimental X-ray photoelectron spectra on petroleum cokes and demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible for N to exhibit rather large core level 1s energies without requiring the presence of any charge transfer from N-oxide groups. Theoretical reasons for such a behavior are also given. "
"1H NMR analysis of seven 2-selenobenzylamine derivatives (ArSeX, 1\xe2\x88\x927) has revealed the existence of attractive nonbonded interaction between the divalent selenium and an unsymmetric amino nitrogen, whose strength significantly depends on the relative electrophilic reactivity of the selenium moiety. In the intermediate cases (5, X = CN; 6, X = SPh), the dissociation energy of the Se\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N nonbonded interaction was evaluated as 12.4 and 10.8 kcal/mol, respectively, by variable-temperature 1H NMR spectral simulations. The corresponding values were roughly estimated as >18.8 kcal/mol for the strong cases (2, X = Br; 3, X = Cl; 4, X = OAc) and <7.7 kcal/mol for the weak cases (1, X = SeAr; 7, X = Me). In order to elucidate physicochemical properties of the interaction, 15N-labeled compounds were synthesized. Downfield shifts of 15N NMR (\xce\x94\xce\xb4N) and increment of JSe\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N (coupling constant between 77Se and 15N) were observed with increasing Se\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N interaction. In the case of strong Se\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N interaction, saturation of coupling constants was observed. These experimental observations as well as large NBO deletion energies (3-21G* and LANL1DZ) between the selenium and the nitrogen for model compounds (9\xe2\x88\x9213) strongly suggested that the observed Se\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N interaction is mainly caused by the orbital interaction between the nitrogen lone pair (nN) and the antibonding orbital of the Se\xe2\x88\x92X bond (\xcf\x83*Se-X).

"The electronic transitions of the S = 9/2 class III mixed-valence dimer [Fe2(OH)3(tmtacn)2]2+ are assigned using absorption, magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), and resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopies. This set of excited-state assignments allows the relative contributions of metal\xe2\x88\x92metal and metal\xe2\x88\x92ligand interactions to the D3h molecular-orbital energy splittings to be estimated. From this analysis the pathway for valence delocalization in this dimer is determined to involve a significant direct Fe\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Fe \xcf\x83-bonding interaction. The spectroscopic analysis is supported by electronic-structure calculations, which predict a spectrum similar to that observed and provide descriptions of the dimer\'s molecular orbitals. These results are further supported by the observation of a significant increase in the Fe\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Fe internuclear separation with \xcf\x83\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x83* excitation, determined by vibronic analysis of the \xcf\x83\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x83* absorption band shape and associated RR excitation profiles. Combined, these results provide a measure of the geometry dependence of the double-exchange electron-transfer parameter, B, that dominates the ground-state magnetic properties of this dimer. The excited-state assignments also identify the superexchange pathways active in this dimer and provide a spectroscopic measure of the ground-state Heisenberg exchange-coupling constant, yielding \xe2\x88\x9223 < J < +2 cm-1. The fact that J is small is confirmed by variable-temperature magnetic-susceptibility experiments, which provide an upper limit of \xe2\x88\xbc70 cm-1 for the magnitude of antiferromagnetic coupling in this dimer. The contributions of B, J, and vibronic coupling to the valence-delocalized S = 9/2 ground state of [Fe2(OH)3(tmtacn)2]2+ are related to the analogous properties of mixed-valence iron\xe2\x88\x92sulfur and other non-heme iron dimers. From this comparison it is concluded that significant direct Fe\xe2\x88\x92Fe electronic coupling also occurs in [Fe2S2]+ dimers, but the combination of an order-of-magnitude increase in Heisenberg exchange coupling relative to that of [Fe2(OH)3(tmtacn)2]2+ and the greater influence of vibronic-coupling terms in S = 1/2 vs S = 9/2 states outweighs this electronic coupling and leads to the valence-trapped antiferromagnetically-coupled ground state observed in [Fe2S2]+ dimers. The difference in Heisenberg exchange between the [Fe2(OH)3(tmtacn)2]2+ and [Fe2S2]+ dimers is related to specific differences in the superexchange pathways and covalencies of metal\xe2\x88\x92bridge interactions.

Distinct differences in the position and number of the ESR signals generated by dehydroxylation of AlPO4 molecular sieves under a vacuum of 10-5 Torr at 773 K clearly show that the nature of the paramagnetic defect centers formed is significantly different in the structure type of the molecular sieves. In addition, it is found that the spin concentration of these defects depends strongly on the pore size of the AlPO4 molecular sieves as well as their hydration level before dehydroxylation. The larger ring size the molecular sieve has, the higher spin concentration of paramagnetic defects it shows. Thus, the extra-large-pore VPI-5 shows the highest spin concentration value among the molecular sieves studied here, which corresponds to 6.4 defects per 1000 unit cells. The ESR results obtained from AlPO4-based molecular sieves containing heteroatoms other than aluminum and phosphorus (such as silicon or cobalt) reveal that the formation of paramagnetic defect centers is severely restricted when the amount of heteroatoms in their framework increases. On the basis of the overall ESR results of this study, a reliable mechanism of formation of paramagnetic defect centers in AlPO4 molecular sieves is proposed. "
"Two different tryptophan radicals (Wa\xe2\x80\xa2 and Wb\xe2\x80\xa2) with lifetimes of several minutes at room temperature are formed during the reconstitution of the diiron center in the Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase mutant protein R2 Y122F. Detailed hyperfine parameters are for the first time determined for protein-linked oxidized neutral tryptophan radicals. Wa\xe2\x80\xa2 is freeze-trapped and investigated by EPR and ENDOR in protonated and selectively deuterated proteins at 20 K. Two hyperfine couplings from the \xce\xb2-methylene protons, hyperfine tensors of two \xce\xb1-protons, and the complete nitrogen hyperfine tensor are determined. Based on the absence of a large hyperfine coupling from the N\xe2\x88\x92H proton, which would be expected for a cation radical, and on comparison of the experimental data with theoretical spin densities from density functional calculations, Wa\xe2\x80\xa2 is assigned to an oxidized neutral tryptophan radical. A small anisotropic hyperfine coupling detected in selectively deuterated Wa\xe2\x80\xa2 is tentatively assigned to a proton which is hydrogen bonded to the nitrogen of Wa\xe2\x80\xa2. A similar spin density distribution as for Wa\xe2\x80\xa2 is obtained also for the second tryptophan radical, Wb\xe2\x80\xa2, observed by EPR at room temperature, which is also assigned to an oxidized neutral radical.

"Two isomeric triarylmethyl-based diradicals, with 3,3\xe2\x80\x98- and 3,4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenyl as the spin coupling units, were prepared and studied in frozen solutions by ESR spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry. The 3,3\xe2\x80\x98-isomer was found to be the singlet ground state, with a singlet\xe2\x88\x92triplet energy gap of \xe2\x88\x920.1 kcal/mol. The 3,4\xe2\x80\x98-isomer was found to be the triplet ground state. This dependence of intramolecular spin coupling (antiferromagnetic vs ferromagnetic) on topology is in agreement with simple theoretical models. The singlet ground state for the 3,3\xe2\x80\x98-isomer, which has two half-filled nonbonding orbitals, is in formal violation of Hund\'s rule, as applied to molecules. "
"Photolysis of 5-substituted-N-tert-butyl-3-methylanthranilium ion produces transient N-tert-butyl-(2-acetyl-4-substituted) phenylnitrenium ions. This is confirmed by identification of the stable products, transient absorption experiments, and photothermal beam deflection experiments. Analysis of the stable photoproducts shows that the major decay pathway for these species is addition of nucleophiles to the aromatic ring. The kinetics of the these reactions were examined with the goal of determining how various ring substituents affect arylnitrenium ion stability. Rate constants measured for the 4-phenyl and 4-methoxy derivatives are compared with those from previous work. It is shown that a 4-phenyl group stabilizes the nitrenium ion to approximately the same extent as a 4-methoxy group. Both of these substituents stabilize the arylnitrenium ions considerably more than 4-halogens or a 4-methyl group. Time resolved photothermal beam deflection experiments were applied to the 4-cyano and 4-unsubstituted derivatives, which gave no transient absorption spectra. The latter two compounds are shown to have lifetimes of less than 100 ns. "
"Addition of 2,4-dimethylbenzenesulfenyl chloride to sialic acid glycal gives crystalline 2-chloro-3-thiosialic acid 3 in 85% yield. Reaction of 3 with sodium thiomethoxide in acetonitrile at 0 \xc2\xb0C affords the sialic acid donor \xce\xb1-2-(methylthio)-3-thiosialic acid 4 in quantitative yield. Sialylation of glycosyl acceptors 9 and 10 with 4 in the presence of phenylsulfenyl triflate (PST) as promotor in CH3CN at \xe2\x88\x9240 \xc2\xb0C gives \xce\xb1-sialosides in good yield and excellent stereoselectivity. No \xce\xb2-sialosides are formed in either case. Removal of the auxiliary 3-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)thio group is achieved in high yield using Ph3SnH and AIBN in refluxing toluene. Protected GM3 trisaccharide and 6-sial-2-yllactose were obtained on a gram scale. "
"The ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase (RTPR) from Lactobacillus leichmannii requires adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) as a cofactor to catalyze the conversion of nucleotides to deoxynucleotides. RTPR has previously been shown to catalyze the homolytic cleavage of the carbon\xe2\x88\x92cobalt bond of AdoCbl, and the resulting paramagnetic species has been characterized by rapid freeze-quench EPR spectroscopy (Orme-Johnson, W. H.; Beinert, H.; Blakley, R. L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974, 249, 2338\xe2\x88\x922343. Licht, S.; Gerfen, G. J.; Stubbe, J. Science 1996, 271, 477\xe2\x88\x92481). This study presents simulations of X- and Q-band EPR spectra of this intermediate. Modeling this species as a thiyl radical coupled to cob(II)alamin by electron-electron exchange and dipolar interactions yields reasonable fits to spectra obtained at both microwave frequencies, whereas simulations that employ a single-spin model do not. This modeling provides support for the intermediacy of a thiyl radical in this system. The techniques employed here may prove generally useful in simulation of similar spectra observed in other B12-dependent enzyme systems. "
"The use of pyrrole\xe2\x88\x92imidazole polyamides for the recognition of core 5\xe2\x80\x98-GGG-3\xe2\x80\x98 sequences in the minor groove of double stranded DNA is described. Two hairpin pyrrole\xe2\x88\x92imidazole polyamides, ImImIm-\xce\xb3-PyPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp and ImImImPy-\xce\xb3-PyPyPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp (Im = N-methylimidazole-2-carboxamide, Py = N-methylpyrrole-2-carboxamide, \xce\xb2 = \xce\xb2-alanine, \xce\xb3 = \xce\xb3-aminobutyric acid, and Dp = ((dimethylamino)propyl)amide), as well as the corresponding EDTA affinity cleaving derivatives, were synthesized and their DNA binding properties analyzed. Quantitative DNase I footprint titrations demonstrate that ImImIm-\xce\xb3-PyPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp binds the formal match sequence 5\xe2\x80\x98-AGGGA-3\xe2\x80\x98 with an equilibrium association constant of Ka = 5 \xc3\x97 106 M-1 (10 mM Tris\xc2\xb7HCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.0 and 22 \xc2\xb0C). ImImImPy-\xce\xb3-PyPyPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp binds the same site, 5\xe2\x80\x98-AGGGAA-3\xe2\x80\x98, approximately two orders of magnitude more tightly than the six ring polyamide, with an equilibrium association constant of Ka = 4 \xc3\x97 108 M-1. The eight-ring hairpin polyamide demonstrates greater specifity for single base pair mismatches than does the six ring hairpin. Polyamides with an EDTA\xc2\xb7Fe(II) moiety at the carboxy terminus confirm that each hairpin binds in a single orientation. The high affinity recognition of a 5\xe2\x80\x98-GGG-3\xe2\x80\x98 core sequence by an eight ring polyamide containing three contiguous imidazole amino acids demonstrates the versatility of pyrrole\xe2\x88\x92imidazole polyamides and broadens the sequence repertoire for DNA recognition.

"The hydrolysis of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (APA) at neutral pH, catalyzed by the class C \xce\xb2-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99, was observed from 1H NMR spectra to yield an unexpected product, 8-hydroxypenillic acid, in bicarbonate-containing buffers. This product probably arises from turnover of the carbamate of APA by the enzyme. 1H and 13C NMR spectra of APA in bicarbonate solutions clearly demonstrate the presence of the carbamate. Turnover of APA at saturating concentrations by the enzyme is accelerated by bicarbonate and by methanol. These results suggest that deacylation of the enzyme is rate determining and that the presence of the carbamate affects this step. A mechanism involving rate-determining intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the carbamate on the acyl enzyme is proposed to rationalize these observations and lead to formation of 8-hydroxypenillate. This reaction can be seen as an example of substrate-assisted enzymic catalysis. Quantitative analysis of the data indicated a dissociation constant of the APA-carbamate to APA and bicarbonate of 7 mM at pH 7.5. The P99 \xce\xb2-lactamase also catalyzes the formation of an alternative product from 7-aminocephalosporanic acid in the presence of bicarbonate. Ampicillin and cephaloglycine which also possess an amine-bearing side chain [PhCH(NH2)CO\xe2\x88\x92] react with bicarbonate to form carbamates at neutral pH but these do not yield alternative products on turnover by the P99 \xce\xb2-lactamase. Typical class A \xce\xb2-lactamases do not catalyze 8-hydroxypenillate formation from APA and bicarbonate even when deacylation is rate determining. This difference is discussed in terms of \xce\xb2-lactamase active site structure. "
"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is thought to play a large role in human liver cancer in some parts of the world, and the mechanism of genotoxicity is generally considered to involve the DNA adduct formed at the guanyl N7 atom. The exo epoxide, the genotoxic isomer formed by human cytochrome P450 3A4, has been known to be very unstable in H2O (t1/2 < 10 s). The rates of hydrolysis of AFB1 exo epoxide have been determined as a function of pH using stopped flow kinetics. The spontaneous reaction with solvent is faster than previously suspected, with a t1/2 \xe2\x88\xbc1 s when either absorbance or fluorescence kinetic traces are measured at ambient temperature. An acid-catalyzed reaction with a bimolecular rate constant of 2 \xc3\x97 103 M-1 s-1 is operative below about pH 5 and elevates the rate. The hydrolysis product, AFB diol, reversibly converts to a furofuran-ring-opened oxyanionic AFB1 \xce\xb1-hydroxydialdehyde (AFB dialdehyde) under slightly basic conditions. When AFB diol was treated with base in DMSO, conversion to AFB dialdehyde was accompanied by dehydration of the remaining alcohol group. In aqueous solution, the AFB diol:AFB dialdehyde equilbrium has been characterized and the pKa (8.2) is much higher than previously suggested; the base-catalyzed bimolecular rate of 2.3 \xc3\x97 103 M-1 s-1 results in a very slow rate of conversion at physiological pH. Multiphasic conversion of AFB dialdehyde back to AFB diol has a slow rate-limiting step at 0.01 s-1 and is nearly quantitative. The dehydrated AFB dialdehyde formed in DMSO did not form a detectable ring closed derivative. "
"The synthesis and characterization of various optically active nanoscale-size tetranuclear assemblies held together by coordination bonds is described. Interaction of bis[4-(4\xe2\x80\x98-pyridyl)phenyl]iodonium triflate and bistriflates of chiral transition metal (Pd(II) or Pt(II)) bisphosphines resulted in the formation of chiral hybrid iodonium-transition metal molecular squares. Restricted rotation of the coordinated bis[4-(4\xe2\x80\x98-pyridyl)phenyl]iodonium moiety was detected in these squares and investigated by using variable-temperature NMR. The preparation of chiral hybrid squares which possess the elements of helicity (twist) in the assembly was accomplished using the above bisphosphines and bis(3-pyridyl)iodonium triflate. Interaction between the bistriflates of chiral (R(+)-BINAP or S(\xe2\x88\x92)-BINAP)) transition metal (Pd(II) or Pt(II)) bisphosphines and a diaza ligand with C2h symmetry, 2,6-diazaanthracene (DAA) or 2,6-diazaanthracene-9,10-dione (DAAD), in acetone at ambient temperature results in chirality-directed assembly of a single stable diastereomer or highly enriched diastereomeric mixtures of optically active macrocyclic molecular squares. The stereochemical outcome of such self-assembly at the full combinatorial level was investigated as well by the use of achiral Pd(II) or Pt(II) bisphosphine complexes. "
"A composite template for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) inhibitors and a hypothetical model of the active site of neutral endopeptidase (NEP, EC 3.4.24.11) have been constructed and used to guide the design of dual ACE/NEP inhibitors. For the ACE template, a new computer program was used to flexibly superimpose potent, conformationally restricted ACE inhibitors. This program, which only considers the structures of the ligands, generated three possible templates. It was possible to evaluate the plausibility of these templates because new X-ray data is extending our knowledge of the binding of ligands to zinc metalloproteases. We have found that the available X-ray structures of inhibitors complexed to different zinc metalloproteases share certain conformational features. In each complex, the regions between the catalytic zinc and the P1\xe2\x80\x98 side chain were found to have almost the same geometry. This geometry appears to be dictated by the mechanism of catalysis. Only one of the templates displays this geometry and is, therefore, proposed as a pharmacophore for ACE. To simulate NEP, we used the crystal structure of the active site of thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.4). These models of ACE and NEP predict that the conformation an inhibitor must adopt to bind to ACE differs from that required for binding to NEP. We have designed inhibitors in which conformationally restricted sections are linked by a flexible hinge, allowing the molecules to adapt to the conformation required by each enzyme. One of these inhibitors, a tricyclic \xce\xb1-thiol, 18 (CGS 28106), was found to inhibit both ACE and NEP with an IC50 of 40 and 48 nM, respectively. The models predict that 18 binds to the S1\xe2\x80\x98, S2\xe2\x80\x98, and S3\xe2\x80\x98 subsites of NEP and thermolysin and to the S1, S1\xe2\x80\x98, and S2\xe2\x80\x98 subsites of ACE. The predicted mode of binding of 18 to thermolysin was experimentally verified by the determination of the X-ray crystal structure of the thermolysin/18 complex. This is the first reported three-dimensional structure of an \xce\xb1-thiol bound to a zinc metalloprotease. Except for a single NEP inhibitor, the models we propose for ACE and NEP are able to differentiate between active and inactive compounds reported in the present as well as other studies of dual ACE/NEP inhibition.

"A full account is given of the first racemic syntheses of agelasimine-A (1a) and agelasimine-B (2a), adenine-related bicyclic diterpenoids isolated from the marine sponge Agelas mauritiana. Central synthetic features include a highly stereoselective construction of the diol (\xc2\xb1)-13, a key intermediate for their common diterpene portion, and regioselective alkylations on the adenine portions. The palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of the 9-alkyl-9-BBN derivative (\xc2\xb1)-17 with the 1-alkenyl triflate or halides 15a\xe2\x88\x92c was examined in detail as a preliminary to the preparation of the precursor (\xc2\xb1)-10. The above syntheses of (\xc2\xb1)-1a and (\xc2\xb1)-2a have unequivocally confirmed the correctness of the structures and relative stereochemistries proposed for agelasimine-A and -B. The reaction of (\xc2\xb1)-1a with acetic anhydride in pyridine afforded the monocyclic imidazole derivative (\xc2\xb1)-25a, which was found to correspond to \xe2\x80\x9cdiacetylagelasimine-A\xe2\x80\x9d, initially assigned the purine form 26a. A similar acetylation of (\xc2\xb1)-2a led to the racemic synthesis of purino-diterpene (3a), an artifact separated from the acetylated mixture of the crude extract of A. mauritiana. "
"The stereochemical course of the thermal isomerization of trans-1-ethenyl-2-phenylcyclopropane to 4-phenylcyclopentene at 216.4 \xc2\xb0C in the gas phase has been uncovered through syntheses and kinetic studies based on chiral d9-labeled analogs. This example of the vinylcyclopropane-to-cyclopentene rearrangement takes place with the participation of all four stereochemically distinct paths, the relative contributions (\xc2\xb13%) being 58% si, 8% ar, 24% sr, and 10% ai. The stereochemical outcome is determined by alternative diradical transition structures of comparable energy, rather than by orbital symmetry control. "
"(\xe2\x88\x92)-Rosmarinecine (2) is the necine base portion of the pyrrolizidine alkaloid (\xe2\x88\x92)-rosmarinine. (\xe2\x88\x92)-Rosmarinecine is a representative of the group of pyrrolizidines that show a cis relationship between adjacent stereocenters C(1), C(7), and C(7a), in addition to a highly oxygenated skeleton. (\xe2\x88\x92)-Rosmarinecine (2) has been synthesized in eight steps and 14.8% overall yield, as an illustration of a general approach for the construction of pyrrolizidines having this stereochemical feature. The key step in the asymmetric synthesis is a Lewis acid-promoted, tandem inter-[4 + 2]/intra-[3 + 2] cycloaddition between a fumaroyloxy nitroalkene and a chiral vinyl ether. "
"The temperature dependence of intramolecular [2 + 2] photocycloadditions has been studied for two series of cyclohexenones, \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-linked, respectively, to a variously substituted olefin moiety via a trimethylene chain. With one exception, the disappearance quantum yield of the starting material decreases sharply in a narrow temperature range to approximately one-half of its initial value. No such sharp temperature effect was observed on the product ratio, which either remains constant or varies monotonically over the entire temperature range. This indicates that the temperature effects on the disappearance rate and on the product distribution refer to two distinct processes. A mechanism rationalizing this behavior is proposed. "
"A study of rhodium(I)-catalyzed synthetic transformations involving selective breaking of the C\xe2\x88\x92C bond \xce\xb1 to the carbonyl group of cyclobutanones is described. Decarbonylation took place on treatment of a cyclobutanone with an equimolar amount of (Ph3P)3RhCl at reflux in toluene to afford the corresponding cyclopropane. The formation of the cyclopropane suggests that Rh(I) undergoes an insertion into the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the \xce\xb1-carbon in the initial step. Catalytic decarbonylation of cyclobutanone was also achieved. The mode and rate of the reaction depended greatly on the ligands of the rhodium(I) complex. When a cyclobutanone bearing a hydrogen atom at the 3-position was used, appropriate choice of the catalyst system led to the selective formation of either a cyclopropane or an alkene. Breaking of the carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon bond was next combined with hydrogenolysis. When cyclobutanone was treated under hydrogen pressure with a catalytic amount of a rhodium(I) complex having a bidentate diphosphine ligand like 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, a ring-opened alcohol was produced in good yield. Selective breaking of C\xe2\x88\x92C bonds by a soluble transition metal complex is achieved in these practical synthetic processes. "
"The origin of the acidity of carboxylic acids and enols has been examined via ab initio MO calculations at the MP2/6-31+G** and Becke3LYP/6-31+G** levels as well as with the CBS-4 and CBS-Q model chemistries. The changes in electron populations that occur on ionization were examined in some detail. In the conversion of vinyl alcohol to its alkoxide ion, the \xcf\x83 electrons of the proton are donated to the oxygen. The repulsion between the increased \xcf\x83 density at oxygen and its \xcf\x80 electrons leads to transfer of \xcf\x80 electron density to the CC double bond. At the same time, the negative charge at oxygen repels the \xcf\x83 and \xcf\x80 electrons of the attached carbon. A part of the negative charge appears at the hydrogens that are in the nodal plane of the \xcf\x80 system. With longer chains, \xcf\x83/\xcf\x80 polarization leads to compensating charge shifts so as to minimize the differences between adjacent carbons. When a carbonyl group is attached, as in carboxylic acids and enols, it serves to stabilize the system by accepting some \xcf\x80 electron density (\xe2\x88\xbc0.1 e) and by a stabilizing electrostatic interaction between the positively charged carbonyl carbon and the adjacent negatively charged atom. The stabilization is on the order of 40 kcal/mol for carboxylic acids and 28 kcal/mol for enols. The effect of polar solvents on relative acidities also was examined using a new reaction field model, and experimental observations were reproduced. "
"The following derivatives of 7-hydroxytetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid {Tic(OH) [I]}, a conformationally restricted analogue of tyrosine, were synthesized for the purpose of photophysical studies and in order to elucidate the nature of tyrosine fluorescence and its decay:\xe2\x80\x89 Ac-Tic(OH) [II], Ac-Tic(OH)-NHMe [III], Tic(OH)-NHMe [IV], Ala-Tic(OH) [V], Ac-Ala-Tic(OH) [VI], and Tic(OH)-Gly-NH2 [VII]. For the simple Tic(OH) derivatives I\xe2\x88\x92IV, the N-methylamide was found to be a more effective quencher than the acetyl group. For the peptidic derivatives V\xe2\x88\x92VII the highest quenching of the fluorescence of the phenolic chromophore was observed in the case of Ala-Tic(OH). The simple Tic(OH) derivatives I\xe2\x88\x92IV were also the subject of theoretical studies (MOPAC 93). The obtained thermodynamic parameters (MOPAC calculations) and the fluorescence components were discussed on the basis of the rotamer theory in order to explain the participation of an individual rotamer in the complex process of the fluorescence decay of tyrosine.

"The complete relative and absolute stereochemistries have been elucidated for the ansamycin antibiotics (+)-trienomycins A, B, and C and their potent antifungal congeners, the (+)-mycotrienins I and II. A new species, (+)-trienomycin F, has also been isolated and characterized. In addition, an end-game synthetic strategy for the trienomycins and mycotrienins has been developed. "
"The first total syntheses of (+)-trienomycins A and F, representative members of a new class of cytotoxic ansamycin antibiotics, have been achieved. Key features of the unified synthetic scheme included incorporation of the (E,E,E)-triene unit with concomitant macrocyclization via a novel bis-Wittig olefination and the use of (2,2,2-trichloroethoxy)methyl protecting group for the secondary amide.

"A layered protonic titanate of lepidocrocite-type, HxTi2-x/4\xe2\x96\xa1x/4O4\xc2\xb7H2O (x \xe2\x88\xbc 0.7; \xe2\x96\xa1, vacancy), has been exfoliated on the action of an aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium (hereafter TBA) hydroxide, which resulted in a stable colloidal suspension. A colloidal aggregate centrifuged from the suspension was examined by an in situ X-ray diffraction technique under conditions where drying speed was controlled. The diffraction immediately after separation from the liquid phase was principally amorphous except for a series of sharp reflections detected in a small angle scattering region. On the basis of the line profile analysis, the latter diffraction feature was accounted for by the fundamental intersheet interference of a spacing >10 nm, which demonstrates the existence of a novel associated pair of the titanate nanosheets accommodating a large volume of water cluster between them. These XRD data provide persuasive evidence for delamination into single layers. Upon drying, the amorphous halo disappeared and changed into a well-ordered crystalline pattern. This can be explained by reassembling of the individual sheets which was initiated from the paired species. A TBA intercalated compound was finally obtained as a result of drying. The theoretical simulations on the XRD data revealed that the process involves increase of the crystallites which grows in number of the sheets but shrinks in terms of intersheet distance. The dynamic process from the colloidal nanosheets to the restacked layered structure was followed here for the first time, which throws light upon the inherent nature of \xe2\x80\x9csingle-layer colloidal suspensions\xe2\x80\x9d as inorganic macromolecules.

"Substrate analogues cis- and trans-2-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid were synthesized as probes for a semiquinone radical intermediate in the (2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)propionate 1,2-dioxygenase reaction. These analogues were found to be substrates for oxidative cleavage by extradiol dioxygenases from Escherichia coli and Alcaligenes eutrophus. The stereochemistry of the ring fission products was analyzed by conversion to cyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acids using the ensuing hydrolase enzyme MhpC, followed by GCMS analysis. This analysis revealed 85\xe2\x88\x9294% trans product and 6\xe2\x88\x9215% cis products, implying that cis/trans isomerization of the cyclopropyl ring substituents had taken place during the enzymatic conversion. These results are consistent with a reversible opening of the cyclopropyl ring, and hence consistent with the intermediacy of a semiquinone radical intermediate in the extradiol catechol dioxygenase reaction.

"The synthesis, optical spectroscopy, photophysical properties, electrochemistry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of a series of [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(perfluoroalkyl)porphinato]zinc(II) complexes and their free base analogs are reported. The title compounds were prepared by a condensation methodology that utilizes perfluoro-1-(2\xe2\x80\x98-pyrrolyl)-1-alkanol precursors and employs continuous water removal throughout the course of the reaction to yield the meso perfluorocarbon-substituted porphyrins. The nature of the porphyrin-pendant meso-perfluoroalkyl group exerts considerable influence over the macrocycle\'s solubility properties. The structure of the monopyridyl adduct of [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(heptafluoropropyl)porphinato]zinc(II) features an S4-distorted porphyrin core; X-ray data are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 P1\xcc\x84 with a = 15.1330(5) \xc3\x85, b = 19.2780(6) \xc3\x85, c = 14.6030(4) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb1 = 110.220(2)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb2 = 103.920(2)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb3 = 85.666(2)\xc2\xb0, V= 3880.1(2) \xc3\x853, dcalc = 1.887 g cm-3, and Z = 4. Electrochemical studies carried out on these porphyrin and (porphinato)zinc(II) complexes indicate that meso-perfluoroalkylporphyrins are among the most electron-deficient porphyrinic species known. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments corroborate the electron poor nature of these systems and evince extreme stabilization of the nitrogen 1s orbitals, consonant with particularly effective removal of electron density from the macrocycle by the meso-perfluoroalkyl moieties that is modulated by \xcf\x83-symmetry orbitals. The photophysical properties of these compounds differ from all other previously reported highly electron deficient porphyrin macrocycles in that they possess long-lived, fluorescent excited states; hence their optoelectronic features are consistent with a variety of excited-state electron-transfer quenching schemes in which both 1ZnP* and 1H2P* can be utilized as potent photooxidants.

"Several cationized forms of bradykinin (BK) were generated in the gas phase using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI). Accurate collision cross sections were obtained using the ion chromatography method. The species studied include (BK + H)+, (BK + Na)+, and (BK \xe2\x88\x92 H + 2Na)+. It was found that all three species had very similar cross sections of 245 \xc2\xb1 3 \xc3\x852, and these cross sections were independent of temperature from 300 to 600 K. It could be concluded from these data that BK wraps itself around the charge center(s) in a globular shape whose time average size changes little up to 600 K. The arrival time distributions of all three systems were narrow, only slightly broader than expected for a single species indicating cationized BK exists in only a few low-energy conformers at low temperature. A detailed analysis of the data was done using molecular mechanics/dynamics of the AMBER 4.0 suite of programs. The calculations were in excellent agreement with experiment in that scatter plots indicated cross sections of 100 member structural sets of (BK + H)+, (BK + Na)+, and (BK \xe2\x88\x92 H + 2Na)+ were very similar. Further, very extensive dynamics studies over the range 200 to 600 K indicated the lowest energy conformers exhibited cross sections independent of temperature in agreement with experiment and supported the indication that only a few conformers are involved. The absolute magnitudes of the AMBER generated 0 K structures were \xe2\x88\xbc10% smaller than experiment. The discrepancy decreased to \xe2\x88\xbc5% when the systems were thermally averaged at 300 K. Selected 0 K conformers of (BK + H)+ were calculated using AM1 and PM3 from AMBER starting structures. It was found that the 0 K cross sections increased by \xe2\x88\xbc5% over the AMBER structures providing better agreement with experiment. The extensive conformer sets generated in the scatter plots were analyzed to see which parts of BK preferred to bind to the charge sites. As expected the binding was global, but each isomer or system had different preferred binding sites. We looked for a preference of BK forming a \xce\xb2-turn in the Ser6-Pro7-Phe8-Arg9 sequence since such a feature had been proposed in solution NMR studies. We found little evidence for \xce\xb2-turns in our 500 conformers of variously cationized BK in the gas phase. "
"Relative energetics of fragmentation of protonated peptides are investigated by using electrospray ionization/surface-induced dissociation (ESI/SID) tandem mass spectrometry. ESI/SID fragmentation efficiency curves (percent fragmentation versus laboratory collision energy) are presented for 20 oligopeptides and are a measure of how easily a peptide fragments. The relative positions of the ESI/SID fragmentation efficiency curves depend on several parameters which include peptide composition (e.g., presence/absence of a basic amino acid residue) and peptide size. The ESI/SID fragmentation efficiency curves, in combination with quantum chemical calculations, provide a unique approach to substantiate and refine the mobile proton model for peptide fragmentation. Selected peptides are also investigated to further test and confirm the mobile proton model; these include doubly-protonated peptides and chemically-modified peptides (i.e., acetylated and fixed-charge derivatized peptides). Doubly-protonated peptides fragment more easily than the singly-protonated forms of the same peptides, with a sequence dependence for the difference in energy required for the fragmentation of singly- vs doubly-protonated peptides. Acetylation at the amino terminus and arginine side chain leads to a decrease in basicity and a corresponding lower energy onset for fragmentation than for the unmodified form of the peptide. Fixing the site of charge by addition of trimethylammonium acetyl to the amino terminus, i.e., eliminating the mobile proton, results in a higher energy onset than that for the protonated form of the same peptide. Curves for doubly protonated peptides with two adjacent basic residues (Arg, Arg) suggest the localization of the two protons at the two basic side chains rather than at opposite termini of the peptide.

"Recent work reported in the literature has shown new evidence of a sputtered ion mechanism for associative ion surface reactions occurring during surface induced dissociation (SID) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). In the context of a sputtered ion mechanism, we have studied selected routes to the formation of C7H7+ during the low-energy collision (ca. 30 eV) of benzene molecular ions with surfaces covered with a hydrocarbon overlayer. A key approach utilized in this work is the use of gas phase ion molecule chemistry to model reactive ion surface collisions. Benzene, 2H6-labeled benzene, and 13C6-labeled benzene have been examined by SID and collision activated dissociation (CAD). The CAD experiments have been used to investigate the fragmentation of hydrocarbon adducts of benzene and labeled benzene formed by methane and isobutane chemical ionization (CI) as models of those ions which may be formed via a sputtered ion mechanism during SID. In addition, the thermodynamics of many of the possible sputtered ion routes to the formation of C7H7+ have been compared using experimental heats of formation as well as total energies and zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVE) obtained by ab initio (MP2 6-31G*//HF 6-31G*) calculations. While there are several seemingly viable sputtered ion routes to the formation of C7H7+ during SID of benzene molecular ions, the combination of thermodynamic considerations and experimental results suggest that a likely sputtered ion route involves the reaction of neutralized benzene ions with C3H5+ ions (sputtered from the hydrocarbon overlayer) followed by the loss of ethene.

"Given the avid and selective metal binding properties of naturally-occurring metalloproteins, it is possible to exploit these systems in the development of novel sensors, i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cbiosensors\xe2\x80\x9d, for the detection of trace quantities of metal ions. Here, we exploit the high affinity of human carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) for zinc in the detection of nanomolar concentrations of this metal ion by fluorescence anisotropy using a fluorescein-derivatized arylsulfonamide probe, 4-aminosulfonyl[1-(4-N-(5-fluoresceinylthioureido)butyl)]benzamide (3). This probe was designed through an iterative, structure-based approach and was demonstrated to bind tightly only to the zinc-bound holoenzyme (Kd = 2.3 nM) and not the metal-free apoenzyme. Furthermore, the probe exhibits anisotropy that is proportional to the concentration of bound zinc, and this behavior can be exploited in the detection of zinc in the 10\xe2\x88\x921000 nM range. Strategies for the structure-based design of improved CAII-based metal ion biosensors are considered in view of these results. "
"The problem of intramolecular hydrogen atom exchange in the OsH3(BH4)(PR3)2 system is examined from both theoretical and experimental points of view, through ab initio MO calculations on the OsH3(BH4)(PH3)2 system at the MP2, MP4, and CCSD(T) computational levels and variable-temperature 1H NMR studies on the OsH3(BH4)(PiPr3)2 complex. Three different exchange processes are fully characterized from a theoretical point of view through location of intermediates and transition states. Experimental results supporting the existence of these three different exchange processes and providing definitely its intramolecular nature are also presented. "
"The potential of dimethylsilylene and isopropylidene \xcf\x83-spacers as bridges for photoinduced charge transfer (CT) in 4-cyano-4\xe2\x80\x98-(dimethylamino)- and 4-cyano-4\xe2\x80\x98-methoxy-substituted diphenyldimethylsilanes and 2,2-diphenylpropanes was studied. Fluorescence solvatochromism and time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements show that upon photoexcitation a charge separated state (D\xe2\x80\xa2+\xcf\x83A\xe2\x80\xa2-)* is populated in all compounds. Excited state dipole moments for a given donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor combination are, irrespective of the bridge, equal. The CT states of the silanes are however lying at lower energies, implying that the presence of silicon thermodynamically facilitates the CT process. Cyclic voltammetry data of model compounds show that this is a consequence of the lowering of the acceptor reduction potential by the silicon bridge. It was however inferred from radiative decay rates that the electronic coupling between the CT and locally excited states as well as the coupling between the ground and CT state is larger for the carbon-bridged compounds. As shown by both solution and solid state electronic spectra and radiative decay rates, the photophysics of the D\xcf\x83A compounds are dominated by intensity borrowing of the CT transitions from transitions localized in the D\xcf\x83 and \xcf\x83A chromophores.

"Burkholderia cepacia AC1100 is able to use the chlorinated compound 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) as the sole source of carbon and energy. CW EPR and one-dimensional ESEEM spectroscopy studies performed earlier indicate the presence of a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster with two coordinated histidine residues in 2,4,5-T monooxygenase from B. cepacia. This paper describes the application of two-dimensional ESEEM (called HYSCORE) spectroscopy for further characterization of the nitrogens surrounding the reduced Rieske-type cluster. The HYSCORE spectra measured at field positions in the neighborhood of the principal directions of the g tensor contain major contributions from cross-peaks correlating the two double-quantum transitions from each histidine nitrogen. These allow the estimation of the diagonal components of the hyperfine tensors along the principal axes of the g tensor:\xe2\x80\x89 4.05, 3.88, and 4.01 MHz (N1) and 4.71, 5.07, and 5.02 MHz (N2). Other spectral features from the histidine nitrogens usually have a much weaker intensity and are occasionally observed in the spectra. HYSCORE measurements have been also performed with the reduced [2Fe-2S] plant ferredoxin-type cluster with four cysteine ligands in a ferredoxin from Porphira umbilicalis, and spectral features produced by the peptide nitrogen are observed. Similar features also appear in the HYSCORE spectra of the Rieske cluster. Systematic differences are observed between 2,4,5-T monooxygenase and published results from related benzene and phthalate dioxygenases that may reflect structural and functional differences in histidine ligation and the nitrogens of nearby amino acids in Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] clusters.

"The photochemistry of ethylene episulfoxide, C2H4SO, has been investigated for the first time by using time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy to probe the SO(X3\xce\xa3-) photofragment on the (B3\xce\xa3-\xe2\x88\x92X3\xce\xa3-) transition. Photodissociation of C2H4SO at 193 and 248 nm produces SO(v\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 = 0\xe2\x88\x926) and SO(v\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 = 0\xe2\x88\x925), respectively. The vibrational state distributions of the SO photofragment are inverted with maxima at v\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 = 1 in both cases. Franck\xe2\x88\x92Condon and impulsive models have been used to fit the experimentally observed vibrational state distributions and the internal energy content of the nascent SO(X3\xce\xa3-) photofragment. These models are unable to fit the experimental observations, when the other fragment is ground-state ethylene, but excellent agreement is obtained for the lowest energy triplet state of C2H4. The time-dependent behavior of the SO(X3\xce\xa3-) LIF signal has been measured, indicating a second ground-state sulfur monoxide production pathway. The experimental SO(X3\xce\xa3-) transients can be fit by a biexponential function. The slower production of SO(X3\xce\xa3-) is believed to be due to relaxation of SO(a1\xce\x94), which is also produced in the photodissociation of C2H4SO. Quantum yields for the production of SO(X3\xce\xa3-) and SO(a1\xce\x94), based on a kinetic analysis, are 0.25 \xc2\xb1 0.04 and 0.41 \xc2\xb1 0.06 following 193 nm irradiation of C2H4SO and 0.34 \xc2\xb1 0.06 and 0.44 \xc2\xb1 0.08 for the 248 nm photolysis.

"Two bichromophoric systems are presented that contain an N-alkylnaphthalimide electron acceptor and a 4-methoxyaniline (3a) or an aniline (3b) electron donor, respectively. Upon photoexcitation of 3a in cyclohexane electron transfer occurs in the singlet manifold to afford the short-lived (\xcf\x84f = 0.75 ns) 1(D+\xe2\x88\x92A-) state in ca. 70% yield. An important decay pathway of this D+\xe2\x88\x92A- state consists of intersystem crossing (ISC) to yield a triplet state localized on the naphthalimide moiety (D\xe2\x88\x923A). In a slightly more polar solvent like di-n-butyl ether, an equilibrium between D\xe2\x88\x923A and 3(D+\xe2\x88\x92A-) is observed by means of transient absorption spectroscopy. Both species decay with an overall decay time of ca. 1 \xce\xbcs. Thus, upon changing the spin multiplicity of the D+\xe2\x88\x92A- state from singlet to triplet, an increase of its lifetime by three orders of magnitude is observed. In more polar solvents like dioxane, THF, and acetonitrile the 3(D+\xe2\x88\x92A-) state is the only species observed in the transient absorption spectrum, with decay times of ca. 1, 0.5, and 0.1 \xce\xbcs, respectively. The D\xe2\x88\x923A state is the precursor state for the 3(D+\xe2\x88\x92A-) state in these solvents. It is proposed that, upon increasing solvent polarity, the singlet charge-separation process is retarded as a result of the large driving force (\xe2\x88\x92\xce\x94GS\xc2\xb0 > 1 eV), which allows the triplet pathway (D\xe2\x88\x921A \xe2\x86\x92 D\xe2\x88\x923A \xe2\x86\x92 3(D+\xe2\x88\x92A-)) to compete effectively. Compound 3b possesses a somewhat weaker donor chromophore than 3a resulting in a smaller driving force. The decay of the locally excited singlet state of 3b occurs mainly via charge separation in the singlet manifold (D\xe2\x88\x921A \xe2\x86\x92 1(D+\xe2\x88\x92A-)). Only in the very polar solvent acetonitrile does the triplet pathway become competitive, and evidence is found for the formation of 3(D+\xe2\x88\x92A-). "
"Kitaigorodskii\'s aufbau principle (KAP) is used to analyze hydrogen bonding as a vector for the packing of molecules in the crystalline solid state. Using the CFF91 force field to compute the molecule\xe2\x88\x92molecule interaction potential, we find that the signature for hydrogen bonding of N\xe2\x88\x92H and O\xe2\x88\x92H donor groups with N or O acceptors is a positive value for the nonbonded van der Waals term of the hydrogen atom involved in the H-bond. The H-bond may occur as a vector in any one or more of the four stages of KAP. We categorize these vectors as types 1\xe2\x88\x924 with 16 possible subtypes depending upon the number of KAP stages in which the H-bond appears. Within the constraints of the force field description, the H-bond then becomes a specific vector contribution to the packing of one or more substructures of the complete crystal. Of the 16 possible vector subtypes we illustrate 12 of them using crystal structure data from the Cambridge Structural Database. Knowing the vector subtype, we show how it is possible to locate the local minima representing the packing geometry of the substructures using Monte Carlo simulation methods. The establishment of quantitative signatures for vector types within KAP substructures and their relationship to crystal engineering is discussed. "
"The geometries of 48 isomers of SiHmPHn (m + n = 0\xe2\x88\x925), SiHmPHnSiHo (m + n + o = 0\xe2\x88\x927), and (SiH3)3P have been optimized at the MP2/6-31G(d) level of theory. Silylenes and cyclic structures dominate the compounds with low numbers of hydrogens; nevertheless, there are several examples of silicon\xe2\x88\x92phosphorus multiple bonding. Relative energies, heats of formation, and bond dissociation energies have been calculated at the G2 level of theory. Two empirical schemes have been constructed to fit the atomization energies. A simple bond additivity approach reproduces the data with a mean absolute deviation of 5.3 kcal/mol. Better results are obtained with a group additivity scheme which gives a mean absolute deviation of 3.4 kcal/mol. "
"The dielectric constants of myoglobin, apomyoglobin, the B fragment of staphylococcal protein A, and the immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G are calculated from 1\xe2\x88\x922 ns molecular dynamics simulations in water, using the Fr\xc3\xb6hlich\xe2\x88\x92Kirkwood theory of dielectrics. This dielectric constant is a direct measure of the polarizability of the protein medium and is the appropriate macroscopic quantity to measure its relaxation properties in response to a charged perturbation, such as electron transfer, photoexcitation, or ion binding. In each case the dielectric constant is low (2\xe2\x88\x923) in the protein interior, then rises to 11\xe2\x88\x9221 for the whole molecule. The large overall dielectric constant is almost entirely due to the charged protein side chains, located at the protein surface, which have significant flexibility. If these are viewed instead as part of the outer solvent medium, then the remainder of the protein has a low dielectric constant of 3\xe2\x88\x926 (depending on the protein), comparable to that of dry protein powders. Similar results were already observed for ferro- and ferricytochrome c, and are probably valid for many or most stable globular proteins in solution, leading to a rather comprehensive picture of charge screening and the dielectric constant of proteins. This picture suggests ways, and supports some ongoing efforts, to improve current Poisson\xe2\x88\x92Boltzmann models. Indeed, treating a protein as a homogeneous, low dielectric medium is likely to underestimate the actual dielectric relaxation of the protein; this would affect calculations of the self-energy of titrating protons, or the reorganization energy of a redox electron.

"Molecular dynamics simulations of a poly(oxyethylene) (POE) chain with 15 ethylene oxide (EO) units have been performed in an aqueous solution for 2 ns at 300 K and for 1 ns at 373 K, a cloud point for POE. The conformation and the hydration structure of POE and the structure and the dynamics of water molecules in the vicinity of POE were examined. The conformation of POE was transformed from a collapsed chain in the gas phase to a helix in water which was maintained for 2 ns. After a simulated annealing at 1000 K, POE still showed a preference for a helix. An extended network of POE\xe2\x88\x92water and water\xe2\x88\x92water hydrogen bonds was found throughout inside the helix, stabilizing the helix backbone. The same helical conformation was maintained even at 373 K. The pair distribution functions for water oxygen atoms near POE indicated significantly enhanced water structures in the hydrophilic region of POE, and to a lesser extent in the hydrophobic region, at both 300 and 373 K. Considerably reduced translational movements of water molecules near POE were also observed at both temperatures. All the results obtained from the simulation are in good agreement with experiments. We discuss the solubility and the phase behavior of POE in water, based on the observation from the simulations. "
"This work explores the structures and energetics of linear and cyclic [N]phenylenes by ab initio calculation at the HF/6-31G* and BLYP/6-31G* density functional levels. Heats of formation were obtained from these energies by a group-equivalents method. In the acyclic case with N = 3\xe2\x88\x925, angular phenylenes are more stable than linear phenylenes. For the cyclic [6]phenylene (antikekulene), which is found to be planar, no appreciable destabilization is found relative to a linear [6]phenylene reference structure. The cyclic [4]- and [5]phenylenes adopt tub conformations. There is a simple relationship between the \xce\x94Hf\xc2\xb0 of an [N]phenylene and that of the corresponding condensed benzenoid. It provides, for example, an estimate of \xce\x94Hf\xc2\xb0 of C120, archimedene, from that of C60. "
"Monte Carlo simulations have been used to determine changes in free energies of solvation for the rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate in water and methanol. Structures and partial charges from the ab initio RHF/6-31G* calculations of Wiest and Houk were used for the pseudodiequatorial and pseudodiaxial conformers of chorismate and for the transition structure. Free energy perturbation calculations yielded the differences in free energies of solvation for the three structures. The calculations reproduce the observed 100-fold rate increase in water over methanol. The origin of the rate difference is traced solely to an enhanced population of the pseudodiaxial conformer in water, which arises largely from a unique water molecule acting as a double hydrogen bond donor to the C4 hydroxyl group and the side-chain carboxylate. A Monte Carlo simulation was also carried out for the transition structure bound to E. coli chorismate mutase in order to characterize the key interactions in the active site. Consistent with earlier computational results for the Claisen rearrangement of allyl vinyl ether and inferences from crystal structures, the Monte Carlo simulations reveal two hydrogen bonds to the enolic oxygen in the transition structure for both the uncatalyzed reaction in water and the enzyme-catalyzed rearrangement.

"The X-ray crystal structures of 12 substrate-based peptidic inhibitors bound in the active site of the aspartyl protease, HIV-1 protease, have been compared. The inhibitor-binding modes of these inhibitors are remarkably similar despite their structural diversity and conformational flexibility. This prompted the design of a bicyclic peptidomimetic inhibitor 13 with macrocyclic components in constrained conformations that are preorganized for receptor-binding. This inhibitor is a consensus conformational mimic of the protease-bound inhibitor structures with superior properties to peptides, including stability to acid and peptidases as well as antiviral activity. Each of its 15- and 16-membered rings, formed through side-chain to backbone condensation, contains two proteolytically resistant amide bonds and either isoleucine or valine linked via a short aliphatic spacer to tyrosine. The two cycles are connected by a hydroxyethylamine transition state isostere. Molecular modeling and NMR studies indicate that each macrocycle is a highly constrained structural mimic of tripeptide components of linear peptide substrates/inhibitors of HIV-1 protease. Thus the bicyclic peptidomimetic superimposes upon and structurally mimics acyclic hexapeptide inhibitors and their analogues. This results in functional mimicry, as demonstrated by comparable inhibition of HIV-1 protease by acyclic and cyclic molecules at nanomolar concentrations. The rational design of cycles which fix receptor-bound conformations of these bioactive peptides has potential applications for the structural mimicry of other bioactive peptides and may facilitate rational drug design.

"Turkey ovomucoid third domain, OMTKY3, is a potent protein inhibitor of most serine proteinases that prefer a neutral residue at the P1 position. It has been a target of increasingly intense scrutiny by site-directed mutagenesis in an attempt to elucidate the sequence-to-reactivity algorithm of the inhibitor. Here we report the total chemical synthesis of (6\xe2\x88\x9256)OMTKY3 using both the stepwise solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) technique and the native chemical ligation approach. After refolding and affinity purification, the resultant products were characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, analytical ion exchange chromatography, measurement of association equilibrium constants with six different serine proteinases, and thermal denaturation studies. The two synthetic proteins were found to be functionally as well as structurally identical to their recombinant counterpart. Moreover, the native chemical ligation and stepwise SPPS techniques gave rise to comparable yields and similar product quality. The native chemical ligation strategy used here presents highly efficient synthetic access to novel analogs of OMTKY3 that can be used for understanding the molecular basis of enzyme\xe2\x88\x92inhibitor recognition.

"Molecular recognition of the guanidinium/phosphate pair was investigated at microscopic interfaces of aqueous micelles and bilayers. Monoalkyl and dialkyl amphiphiles with guanidinium head groups were synthesized and dispersed in water to form micelles and bilayers having guanidinium groups at the aggregate surface. Binding of nucleotides such as AMP to these functionalized aggregates was evaluated by using an equilibrium dialysis (ultrafiltration) method. The observed binding constants of 102\xe2\x88\x92104 M-1 are much larger than the corresponding binding constant reported for a monomerically dispersed pair in the aqueous phase (1.4 M-1) but are smaller than those found at the macroscopic air\xe2\x88\x92water interface (106\xe2\x88\x92107 M-1). Therefore, the macroscopic interface promotes guanidinium\xe2\x88\x92phosphate interaction more effectively than the microscopic interface. The present finding indicates that the microscopic interface can strengthen hydrogen bonding and/or electrostatic interaction even in the presence of water. Saturation binding phenomena were different between micelles and bilayers. All of the guanidinium groups in fluid micelles are effective for phosphate binding, but part of the guanidinium group in bilayers are not effective probably because of steric restriction. "
"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using CHARMM were performed for the solution structures of the pentacoordinate and tetracoordinate PSCS and PRCS adducts of Torpedo californica (Tc) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) formed with 2-(3,3-dimethylbutyl) methylphosphonofluoridate (soman) to assess the molecular origins of stereoselectivity of phosphonylation. MD simulations were also carried out for the PSCS transients in soman-inhibited trypsin to evaluate the differences in the mode of operation of the two enzymes. Parameters for the pentacoordinate phosphonate fragments were constructed from results of an ab initio calculation at the 6-31G* level for a model compound, and those for the tetracoordinate phosphonate fragments were from MNDO calculations. Starting equilibrium structures for the above and for analogous structures for chymotrypsin were generated and energy-optimized in program YETI. The stereoselectivity of AChE for the levorotatory diastereomers of soman amounts to >5.6 kcal/mol difference in transition state free energies and can be rationalized based on the results of the MD calculations:\xe2\x80\x89 There is a predominant conformation of transient forms of the PSCS diastereomer of soman-inhibited AChE in which every ligand in phosphorus is stabilized by an optimal binding feature of the active site. In contrast, the phosphonyl fragment in the PRCS diastereomer may be accommodated with equal difficulty, at least, two different ways:\xe2\x80\x89 In the most favorable conformation, the phosphoryl oxygen is engaged in weak interactions with constituents of the oxyanion hole if adjustments in the C\xce\xb1 backbone and substantial motions of Trp84, Trp233, Phe288, and Phe290 are allowed. The remarkable efficiency of F- departure from the pentacoordinate transition states of phosphonylated AChE cannot be explained by general base catalysis by HisH+440. Leaving group departure from these structures must be promoted by electrostatic forces, \xe2\x80\x9cpush\xe2\x80\x9d from Glu199 and \xe2\x80\x9cpull\xe2\x80\x9d from the oxyanion hole, in addition to steric strain. One of the distinguishing features of the crystal structure of TcAChE is the short H-bonds in the catalytic triad. The His440 N\xce\xb4---OOC\xce\xb2 Asp327 bond distance is 2.5 \xc3\x85 (2.8 \xc3\x85 resolution) in AChE and 0.2 \xc3\x85 shorter than the corresponding H-bond in trypsin and chymotrypsin (1.5 \xc3\x85 resolution). This distance increased to 2.7 \xc3\x85 during the dynamics simulation. However, the average H-bond distances are further shortened by 0.05\xe2\x88\x920.3 \xc3\x85 in energy-minimized structures of the adducts of AChE covalently modified by soman at the pentacoordinate and tetracoordinate intermediate stage. MD simulations of the optimized structures of native AChE and its adducts gave insight into how the skeletal motions accommodate an overcrowded active site particularly in the pentacoordinate adducts. The steric relief is only partial and is balanced by a repositioning of Glu199 toward the catalytic triad and phosphonyl fragment. This subtle reorientation of active-site residues should be relevant to the prominent catalytic efficiency of AChE. "
"A novel cross-linked pyroelectric polymer with pronounced second-order nonlinear optical properties has been prepared. A multistep synthesis with several selective transformations including a kinetic resolution (transesterification) with the highly enantioselective Candida antarctica lipase B, yielded the monomer 4\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-{(R)-(\xe2\x88\x92)-2-[(10-acryloyloxy)decyl]oxy}-3-nitrophenyl 4-{4\xe2\x80\x98-[(11-acryloyloxy)undecyloxy]phenyl} benzoate A2c which displayed a ferroelectric chiral smectic C phase with large spontaneous polarization (175 nC/cm2). The monomer was poled and subsequently cross-linked by in-situ photopolymerization in the surface-stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystalline state. The cross-linked pyroelectric polymer exhibited an electro-optical coefficient (r22 \xe2\x88\x92 r12) of 15\xe2\x88\x9235 pm/V. "
"A simple method to prepare porphyrin \xe2\x80\x9cwheels\xe2\x80\x9d on a micrometer scale is described. It is possible to arrange several types of porphyrin derivatives, including Protoporphyrin IX and Chlorophyll-a, in the form of rings using this method. A mechanism for the formation of these types of assemblies is proposed that is based on the generation of \xe2\x80\x9c2D-gas bubbles\xe2\x80\x9d which induces aggregation of the porphyrin molecules.

"The Michael reaction of active methylene compounds lacking cyano groups such as malonates, \xce\xb2-ketoesters, 1,3-diketones, 1,1-disulfones, nitrocompounds, Meldrum acid, and anthrone with common acceptors proceeds in acetonitrile solution in the presence of [RuH2(PPh3)4] as the catalyst. Cyano acetates, more acidic than malonates in organic solvents, are also excellent substrates for this reaction. In a number of cases, intramolecular aldol reactions catalyzed by [RuH2(PPh3)4] were also observed as side reactions. Catalysis by other ruthenium and rhodium complexes has been examined. Selectivity studies performed with malonate and disulfone donors indicate that the catalyst selectively activates Michael donors that can coordinate with ruthenium(II). Additionally, it has been shown that the reaction requires the presence of free phosphine. Therefore, the Michael reaction of stabilized enolates appears to be a ruthenium- and phosphine-catalyzed reaction. From a practical point of view, the use of readily prepared [RuH2(PPh3)4] as the catalyst in acetonitrile provided the best solution for the Michael reaction of active methylene compounds. "
"Addition of alkylbenzenes with 10-methylacridinium ion (AcrH+) occurs efficiently under visible light irradiation in deaerated acetonitrile containing H2O to yield 9-alkyl-10-methyl-9,10-dihydroacridine selectively. On the other hand, the photochemical reaction of AcrH+ with alkylbenzenes in the presence of perchloric acid in deaerated acetonitrile yields 10-methyl-9,10-dihydroacridine, accompanied by the oxygenation of alkylbenzenes to the corresponding benzyl alcohols. The photooxygenation of alkylbenzenes occurs also in the presence of oxygen, when AcrH+ acts as an efficient photocatalyst. The studies on the quantum yields and fluorescence quenching of AcrH+ by alkylbenzenes as well as the laser flash photolysis have revealed that the photochemical reactions of AcrH+ with alkylbenzenes in both the absence and presence of oxygen proceed via photoinduced electron transfer from alkylbenzenes to the singlet excited state of AcrH+ to produce alkylbenzene radical cations and 10-methylacridinyl radical (AcrH\xe2\x80\xa2). The competition between the deprotonation of alkylbenzene radical cations and the back electron transfer from AcrH\xe2\x80\xa2 to the radical cations determines the limiting quantum yields. In the absence of oxygen, the coupling of the deprotonated radicals with AcrH\xe2\x80\xa2 yields the adducts. The photoinduced hydride reduction of AcrH+ in the presence of perchloric acid proceeds via the protonation of acridinyl radical produced by the photoinduced electron transfer from alkylbenzenes. In the presence of oxygen, however, the deprotonated radicals are trapped efficiently by oxygen to give the corresponding peroxyl radicals which are reduced by the back electron transfer from AcrH\xe2\x80\xa2 to regenerate AcrH+, followed by the protonation to yield the corresponding hydroperoxide. The ratios of the deprotonation reactivity from different alkyl groups of alkylbenzene radical cations were determined from both the intra- and intermolecular competitions of the deprotonation from two alkyl groups of alkylbenzene radical cations. The reactivity of the deprotonation from alkylbenzene radical cations increases generally in the order methyl < ethyl < isopropyl. The strong stereoelectronic effects on the deprotonation from isopropyl group of alkylbenzene radical cations appear in the case of the o-methyl isomer. "
"A measure of the strength of a low barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) in apolar organic media was obtained using synthetic molecules derived from Kemp\'s triacid. The structures feature unusually rigid conformations that enforce intramolecular hydrogen bonds in a dicarboxylic acid, its corresponding acid-amide and their respective conjugate bases. Analysis of proton and deuterium NMR spectra established the formation of a LBHB in the conjugate base of the diacid and a conventional hydrogen bond in the conjugate base of the acid-amide. Through deprotonation equilibria with organic bases, it was determined that the conjugate base of the diacid was more stable than the conjugate base of the acid-amide by 2.4 kcal/mol in benzene and 1.4 kcal/mol in dichloromethane. These figures set the upper limits for the free energy of the additional stabilization arising from the LBHB at 25 \xc2\xb0C. This value is far lower than many estimates but is closer to the recent determinations of Schwartz and Drueckhammer [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 11902\xe2\x88\x9211905]. "
"The reactions between the cobalt carbonyl anchored silanetriol Co3(CO)9CSi(OH)3 (1) and EMe3 (E = Al, Ga and In) in THF result in the formation of the respective group 13 heterosiloxanes [Co3(CO)9CSiO3E\xc2\xb7THF]4 (Al (2); Ga (3); In (4)) in good yields. The new heterosiloxanes have been extensively characterized by means of their analytical and spectroscopic (mass, IR, and NMR) data. Additionally, the molecular structure of the Al complex 2 has been determined by X-ray diffraction studies. The compound contains a cubic Al4O12Si4 core with four Co3(CO)9C cluster units anchored on each of the silicon atoms at the alternating corners of the cube. Interestingly, there are three different types of Co3(CO)9C cluster units within the same molecule based on the mode of coordination of the CO ligands. In order to test the utility of these compounds in catalytic conversions, hydroformylation reactions involving 1-hexene as substrate have been carried out at 120 \xc2\xb0C under a H2/CO initial pressure of 70 bar. A series of solution studies of the catalytic mixture (such as time-dependent IR, NMR, and MS) have been carried out in order to identify the catalytic active species in the process. The Al- and Ga-containing heterosiloxanes show a better hydroformylation activity compared to the In analogue. The regioselectivity of the hydroformylation reactions with 2 is found to be over 60%. The hydroformylation presumably proceeds via the decomposition of Co3(CO)9C cluster fragments into Co2(CO)8 units in the case of catalysts 2 and 3. "
"X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the molybdenum and sulfur K-edges has been used to probe the active site of wild-type and cysteine 207 \xe2\x86\x92 serine mutant human sulfite oxidases. We compare the active site structures in the Mo(VI) oxidation states:\xe2\x80\x89 the wild-type enzyme possesses two MoO ligands at 1.71 \xc3\x85 and three Mo\xe2\x88\x92S ligands at 2.41 \xc3\x85. The mutant molybdenum site is a novel trioxo site with MoO bond lengths of 1.74 \xc3\x85, with two Mo\xe2\x88\x92S ligands at 2.47 \xc3\x85. We conclude that cysteine 207 is a ligand of molybdenum in wild-type human sulfite oxidase, and that, in the mutant, the Mo is ligated to an extra oxo group rather than the hydroxyl of the substituent serine 207.

"The novel \xe2\x80\x9chyper-reduced\xe2\x80\x9d form of protein-bound [3Fe\xe2\x88\x924S] clusters, which is two electron equivalents below the normal reduced form [3Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]0 and thus formally composed entirely of Fe(II) subsites, has been characterized by electrochemistry and by EPR, MCD, and UV/visible spectroscopy. The two-electron reduction of [3Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]0 has been studied for a range of proteins, in particular the 7Fe ferredoxins from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, Desulfovibrio africanus, and Azotobacter vinelandii. In each case, the reaction is chemically reversible, the product is surprisingly inert, and the pH-dependent reduction potential is in the region of \xe2\x88\x92700 mV vs SHE at pH 7, regardless of the identity of the protein. Protein film voltammetry of three different ferredoxins investigated in detail over a wide pH range shows that the novel species denoted as [3Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]2- is formed by a cooperative two-electron reduction of [3Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]0 and there is a net uptake of three protons relative to the all-Fe(III) state [3Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]1+. The protons are probably bound at or close to the cluster (accounting for the strong pH dependence and insensitivity to protein host), but H2 is not evolved despite the negative potential at which [3Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]2- is formed. The hyper-reduced species which is produced reversibly in solution by four-electron electrochemical reduction of the 7Fe ferredoxin from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius contributes little absorbance in the visible spectral region, and shows an MCD spectrum with transitions below 400 nm that resemble features observed for Fe(II) rubredoxin. The EPR spectrum of the four-electron reduced protein differs significantly from that of the normal two-electron reduced form ([3Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]0, [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]1+); the signal at g = 12 assigned to [3Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]0 disappears and changes occur to the spectrum in the g = 1.94 region which can be attributed to alterations in spin coupling with the [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]1+ cluster. As an all-Fe(II) and (probably) protonated species performing two-electron redox reactions, [3Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]2- represents a fundamental entity of iron\xe2\x88\x92sulfur cluster chemistry that has so far remained elusive. Structural and functional implications of this reactivity are considered. "
"The complex formation of bis(ethylenedioxy)tetrathiafulvalene (BEDO-TTF) with 29 organic electron acceptors and six organic anions yielded 37 charge-transfer (CT) complexes, about three-quarters of which exhibited metallic behavior. The BEDO-TTF molecule proves to be an excellent source for stable metals irrespective of the structure, shape, size, and electron affinity of counter components. The crystal structure of metallic BEDO-TTF complexes indicates a strong aggregation of donor molecules into a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure by the aid of both intermolecular CH\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O and side-by-side heteroatom contacts. Band calculations based on an extended H\xc3\xbcckel method demonstrate that the sulfur atoms of the BEDO-TTF molecule are dominant for 2D intermolecular overlap. The resulting 2D electronic bands with large band width serve to stabilize the metallic state even at low temperatures. A comparison between the structural properties of complexes of BEDO-TTF and those of its sulfur analog BEDT-TTF (BEDT-TTF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene) demonstrates that the oxygen atoms of the BEDO-TTF molecule not only enhance the intermolecular S\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7S atomic contacts due to its small size, but also determine donor packing through multiple weak hydrogen bondings. The nicely combined roles of these heteroatoms are the origins of the strongly stabilized metallic state in BEDO-TTF complexes without aid of heavier selenium and/or further addition of sulfur atoms on TTF moiety.

"The synthesis and characterization of the complexes Mo[N(R)Ar]3 (R = C(CD3)2CH3, Ar = 3,5-C6H3Me2), (\xce\xbc-N2){Mo[N(R)Ar]3}2, (\xce\xbc-15N2){Mo[N(R)Ar]3}2, NMo[N(R)Ar]3, 15NMo[N(R)Ar]3, Mo[N(t-Bu)Ph]3, (\xce\xbc-N2){Mo[N(t-Bu)Ph]3}2, and NMo[N(t-Bu)Ph]3 are described. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility data indicate a quartet ground state for Mo[N(R)Ar]3. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies for Mo[N(R)Ar]3 and NMo[N(t-Bu)Ph]3 are described. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) structural studies for Mo[N(R)Ar]3, (\xce\xbc-N2){Mo[N(R)Ar]3}2, and NMo[N(R)Ar]3 are reported. Temperature-dependent kinetic data are given for the unimolecular fragmentation of (\xce\xbc-N2){Mo[N(R)Ar]3}2 to 2 equiv of NMo[N(R)Ar]3 and for the fragmentation of (\xce\xbc-15N2){Mo[N(R)Ar]3}2 to 2 equiv of 15NMo[N(R)Ar]3. The temperature dependence of the 15N2 isotope effect for the latter N2 cleavage process was fitted to a simple harmonic model, leading to a prediction for the difference in NN stretching frequencies for the two isotopomers. The latter prediction was consistent with the Raman spectroscopic data for (\xce\xbc-N2){Mo[N(R)Ar]3}2 and (\xce\xbc-15N2){Mo[N(R)Ar]3}2. The Raman spectroscopic data and EXAFS results are both consistent with an NN bond order of approximately 2 in (\xce\xbc-N2){Mo[N(R)Ar]3}2. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility data consistent with a triplet ground state are given for (\xce\xbc-N2){Mo[N(t-Bu)Ph]3}2. "
"Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry has in recent years significantly advanced the field of polymer analysis. However, the mechanisms of the desorption and ionization processes, and in particular the critical role played by the matrix, remain unclear. In the present work, the usual matrix is replaced with a self-assembled monolayer consisting of a UV absorbing matrix-like compound covalently linked to a gold surface. Analytes such as proteins or oligonucleotides are directly deposited on the covalently modified probe tips and mass analyzed by laser desorption time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry. Several types of monolayers were investigated and tested for their ability to produce positive and negative analyte ions. Molecular ion signals were obtained for dT10 oligonucleotides and proteins as large as cytochrome C on monolayers of methyl N-(4-mercaptophenyl)carbamate (MMPC). The amenability of this model system to characterization with established physical and chemical methods should help investigate the processes involved in MALDI. "
"A series of noncovalent complexes formed between the 86 residue acyl CoA binding protein (ACBP) and a series of acyl CoA derivatives has been studied by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Conditions were found under which CoA ligands can be observed in the mass spectrometer bound to ACBP. Despite the very low dissociation constants (10-7 to 10-10 M) of the acyl CoA ligand complexes high ratios of ligand-to-protein concentration in the electrospray solution were found to increase the proportion of intact complex observed in the spectrum. Variation in the length of the hydrophobic acyl chain of the ligand (C16, C12, C8, C0) resulted in similar proportions of complex observed in the mass spectrum even though significant variation in solution dissociation constants has been measured. A substantially reduced proportion of complex was, however, found for the mutant proteins, Y28N, Y31N, and Y73F, lacking tyrosine residues involved in critical interactions with the CoA ligand. These results have been interpreted in terms of the different factors stabilizing complexes in the gas phase environment of the mass spectrometer. The complexed species were also investigated by hydrogen\xe2\x88\x92deuterium exchange methods combined with mass spectrometric analysis and the results show that folding of ACBP occurs prior to complex formation in solution. The results also show increased hydrogen exchange protection in the complex when compared with the free protein. Furthermore, even after dissociation of the complex, under these nonequilibrium gas phase exchange conditions, increased protection from hydrogen exchange in the complex is maintained. "
"Time-resolved IR spectroscopy has been used to study the oxidative addition of H2 to Fe(CO)4 and its reverse reaction, the reductive elimination of H2 from Fe(CO)4H2, in the gas phase. The rate constant for oxidative addition of H2 shows little temperature dependence, indicating that if there is an activation barrier for this process it is small (<4 kcal mol-1). The activation barrier for the reductive elimination of H2 is 20.5 \xc2\xb1 2.1 kcal mol-1. From these measurements, the average of the dissociation energies for the two Fe\xe2\x88\x92H bonds in Fe(CO)4H2 is calculated to be 62 \xc2\xb1 2 kcal mol-1. Kinetic measurements employing D2 indicate small kinetic isotope effects for both the oxidative addition and reductive elimination reactions. "
"Optimized ab initio molecular orbital calculations on nine bridgehead bicyclic lactams ranging from the 2.2.2 to the 4.3.3 series indicate variations in structural properties, resonance energies, proton affinities, and core orbital ionization energies that reflect the trans-cycloalkene analogy. The smaller lactams are calculated to be N-protonated, the larger O-protonated, and the \xe2\x80\x9ccrossover\xe2\x80\x9d is predicted to occur around the 3.3.1 system. On the basis of resonance energies, larger bridgehead bicyclic lactams could be considered to be hyperstable as Schleyer and co-workers define the concept for larger bridgehead alkenes. This, hyperstability should be apparent in the kinetics of the nucleophilic substitution reactions of the lactams, such as hydrolysis, but not in the thermochemistry of these reactions. "
"The chemical properties of phenyl radicals with different chemically inert charged substituents in the ortho, meta, and para positions were examined in the gas phase in a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. The radicals were generated by replacing a chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom in a radical cation of dihalobenzene with a nucleophile and by cleaving the remaining iodine or bromine atom by collision-activated dissociation. The radicals\' structures were characterized by ion\xe2\x88\x92molecule and dissociation reactions and by comparison to the reactivity of isomeric reference ions. Ab initio molecular orbital calculations (ROMP2/6-31G*//ROHF/6-31G* + ZPE) carried out for the 2-, 3-, and 4-dehydrophenylsulfonium ions suggest that these three species are nearly equal in energy and significantly less stable than the isomeric thiophenol radical cation. Most of the charge density is localized on the substituent in the charged phenyl radicals examined computationally. The odd-spin density at the radical site is calculated to be the same as in the neutral phenyl radical. These computational results predict chemical properties drastically different from those typical for conventional organic radical cations, e.g., the radical cation of thiophenol. This was found to be the case. Phenyl radicals with different charged groups in the meta or para position yield the same reaction products as the neutral phenyl radical (the ortho isomers rearrange upon collisions). Further, charged and neutral phenyl radicals show similar reactivity trends toward different substrates. Examination of the reactivity of radicals of various sizes and with the charged group in different locations with respect to the radical site suggests that the reaction efficiency toward a given substrate is predominantly determined by the electron deficiency at the reacting radical site. All these findings parallel those reported earlier for neutral phenyl radicals, and suggest that phenyl radicals with a chemically inert charged substituent in a remote position provide a useful model for the examination of the properties of neutral phenyl radicals in the gas phase. "
"A dynamic model for the calculation of parahydrogen (p-H2) induced nuclear polarization (PHIP) of hydrogenation products is described which is based on the density matrix formalism. This formalism was proposed previously by Binsch for the calculation of NMR spectra broadened by chemical exchange between different sites. Using numerical simulations typical for actual experiments, it is shown that the PHIP patterns may depend not only on the type of experiment performede.g., ALTADENA (adiabatic longitudinal transport after dissociation engenders net alignment) in the absence and PASADENA (parahydrogen and synthesis allow dramatically enhanced nuclear alignment) in the presence of a magnetic fieldbut also on the pathways of the hydrogenation reaction, in which generally transition metal catalysts are involved. Of particular importance are the properties of possible reaction intermediates where the reactants are complexed alone or together to the catalyst. Indirect information from the PHIP pattern of the hydrogenation products on the intermediate can be obtained, in particular its chemical shifts, exchange and magnetic couplings, and the incoherent dihydrogen self-exchange. In addition, the regioselectivity of the hydrogenation step is a factor influencing the PHIP patterns. The model and the results obtained here provide, therefore, a theoretical link between various phenomena concerning the hydrogen mobility in transition metal catalysts, and PHIP is shown to be a valuable tool for obtaining information on the reaction intermediates.

"4,4\xe2\x80\x98,4\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-Tris(diphenylmethylene)amine (N(p-DPM)3) may be regarded as a prototype of intramolecularly spin-frustrated organic systems. In the present work the monoanion of N(p-DPM)3 was obtained by thermal electron attachment and studied by ESR spectroscopy to find that the ground state is a spin quartet with the fine-structure parameters of |D| = 0.123 cm-1 and |E| = 0.005 cm-1 and an isotropic g factor of 2.003. These results are explained consistently if the excess electron occupies an in-plane n non-bonding MO predominantly localized at the divalent carbon sites and if the molecular structure of N(p-DPM)3\xe2\x80\xa2- is of non-C3 symmetry which indicates the quantum nature of the spin alignment in the spin-frustrated finite system. The temperature dependence of the ESR signal indicates that the lowest excited doublet state of the anion is located at least 300 cm-1 above the quartet ground state. "
"The PASADENA or PHIP effect originates from the breakdown of the parahydrogen symmetry when the two protons are found in magnetically inequivalent positions after hydrogenation. As a result, a signal enhancement of up to 104 in the proton NMR spectra can be observed. We introduce three polarization transfer techniques, namely PH-INEPT, PH-INEPT+, and INEPT(+\xcf\x80/4), that are highly effective to record in situ hetero NMR spectra of parahydrogen-labeled compounds. A complete product operator treatment as well as experimental results for 13C and 29Si have been given. With these sequences we obtained a signal enhancement of 500 which allows in situ NMR investigations of hetero nuclear systems at natural abundance. "
"EPR spectra for the purple mixed-valence [Cu1.5+...Cu1.5+], S = 1/2, site (CuA) in nitrous-oxide reductase (N2OR) were obtained after insertion of either 63Cu or 65Cu or both 65Cu and [15N]histidine. The spectrum of 65Cu- and [15N]histidine-enriched N2OR improved the resolution of the Cu hyperfine lines, but no lines from nitrogen and proton couplings were resolved. The Cu hyperfine parameters obtained by a theory analogous to that of Maki and McGarvey were indicative of a highly covalent Cu site. The total Cu character (CuA1 + CuA2) in the ground state wave function required to describe the spin density distribution was 31\xe2\x88\x9237% compared to 41% for type-1 Cu in plastocyanin. This value does not completely account for the reduction of gmax from 2.23 of type-1 Cu in plastocyanin to 2.18 of CuA. Remaining discrepancies were discussed in terms of different alignments of the principal axes for the hypothetical monomeric CuA1 and CuA2 in [Cu1.5+...Cu1.5+]. This effect appeared in the simulations of the EPR spectra as a noncoincidence between the Cu hyperfine and g principal axis systems. The g-value analysis of CuA predicts an electric dipole forbidden absorption band in the near-infrared region. Based on X-ray structural data of CuA in cytochrome c oxidase, iterative extended H\xc3\xbcckel and UHF-INDO/S calculations on a sulfur-bridged [(NH3)Cu1.5+(SCH3)2Cu1.5+(NH3)]+ core were used to interpret the EPR results. The ground state was selected as 2B3u and not 2B2u, because 2B2u has very little spin density (<0.5%) on the coordinated nitrogen atoms, which contradicts the experimental value of 3\xe2\x88\x925% spin density found on NHis.

"We have prepared Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase containing biosynthetically incorporated (2S,4S)-5-fluoroleucine ([5-F]-Leu DHFR) and have obtained its 1H and 19F NMR spectra at 9.4 Tesla. The 19F spectrum of [5-F]-Leu DHFR showed 12 fairly sharp peaks (one containing two overlapped signals) for the 13 leucine residues in DHFR, covering a chemical shift range of 15 ppm. The large range of chemical shifts observed could not be explained solely in terms of the electrostatic field effects due to local charge fields and is thought to have a second contribution from side-chain conformational differences (\xce\xb3-gauche effects) between different leucine residues, making 19F NMR of aliphatic amino acids in proteins a potentially useful new probe of protein structure.

"The X-ray structure of the nitrogenase MoFe protein has established the organization and architecture of its multimetallic cofactors, the P-cluster (Fe8S7-8) and the FeMo-cofactor (MoFe7S9:homocitrate). Nonetheless, until recently it has not been possible to detect or characterize a substrate or inhibitor interacting with the functioning enzyme. In the present study we have used 57Fe ENDOR to study the CO-inhibited turnover states of a novel suite of 56,57Fe isotopomers of the MoFe protein, including those in which these two clusters are selectively, as well as uniformly, labeled. CO-inhibited MoFe protein exhibits two distinct EPR signals, one under low and another under high CO pressure. The 57Fe measurements, along with an earlier 13C ENDOR study of bound 13CO (Pollock, R. C.; Lee, H. I.; Cameron, L. M.; DeRose, V. J.; Hales, B. J.; Orme-Johnson, W. H.; Hoffman, B. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 8686\xe2\x88\x928687), show that the two EPR signals arise from CO-bound FeMo-cofactor, in one case with one bound CO and in the other with two bound CO, and they further provide initial insights into the properties of the inhibitor-bound cluster.

We have performed density functional theory based ab initio calculations on the crystal structure of sodium guanylyl-3\xe2\x80\x98-5\xe2\x80\x98-cytidine (GpC) nonahydrate. Our calculations are in good agreement with the experimentally determined X-ray structure. This is one of the first attempts to model ab initio nucleic acids in laboratory-realizable conditions. Comparison is also made with empirical force field based structure calculations. 
"The equilibrium acidities (pKHA values) in DMSO of the following hydroxylamines have been measured:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) N-phenylhydroxylamine and its p-bromo and p-cyano derivatives, (2) N-benzyl-N-phenylhydroxylamine and its p-bromo and p-cyano derivatives, (3) O-benzyl-N-phenylhydroxylamine, (4) N-benzoylphenylhydroxylamine and its p-bromo and p-cyano derivatives, and (5) N-hydroxylpiperidine. The BDEs of the O\xe2\x88\x92H and/or N\xe2\x88\x92H bonds in these 11 weak acids have been estimated by combining their pKHA values with the oxidation potentials of their conjugate bases according to the following equation:\xe2\x80\x89 BDEHA = 1.37pKHA + 23.1Eox(A-) + 73.3 kcal/mol.

"The structure and properties of hemoglobin are altered by the introduction of cross-links of defined structure between specific residues. The bis methyl phosphates and bis 3,5-dibromosalicylates of 4-carboxy-trans-cinnamic acid as well as the bis methyl phosphate of 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid produce a 10 \xc3\x85 cross-link between the \xce\xb5-amino groups of each \xce\xb2-lys-82 of human hemoglobin. The oxygen affinity of the modified proteins fits the correlation interpolated from those for shorter and longer cross-links. The oxygen binding curve shows a high degree of cooperativity. These results support the idea that the length of the semirigid cross-link in a structurally homogeneous series constrains the relaxation of the protein upon oxygen binding by a mechanism that is specifically reflected in the oxygen affinity, while interactions between hemes that affect cooperativity are not diminished.

"The synthesis, characterization, and kinetic study of two linear pentapeptides l-threonyl-l-alanyl-l-seryl-l-histidyl-l-aspartic acid (TASHD) and l-seryl-\xce\xb3-aminobutyryl-l-histidyl-\xce\xb3-aminobutyryl-l-aspartic acid (Ser-Gaba-His-Gaba-Asp) that were previously reported by J. C. Sheehan et al. (Cruickshank, P.; Sheehan, J. C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963, 86, 2070\xe2\x88\x922071 and Sheehan, J. C.; Bennett, G. B.; Schneider, J. A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966, 88, 3455\xe2\x88\x923456) to be esterolytic catalysts modeling the active site of chymotrypsin is described. In contrast to these two reports, we observed no catalysis of ester hydrolysis for substrates p-nitrophenyl acetate (p-NPA), N-methoxycarbonyl-l-and-d-phenylalanine-p-nitrophenyl esters using the original conditions reported. In order to probe our conflicting results, accurate measurement of second order rate constants for the hydrolysis of each of these three p-nitrophenyl esters was carried out. The second order rate constants for these hydrolysis reactions were an order of magnitude lower than those originally reported for peptide Ser-Gaba-His-Gaba-Asp and three times lower than those reported for peptide TASHD. A very small difference in the rates of hydrolysis of N-methoxycarbonyl-l-and-d-phenylalanine-p-nitrophenyl esters in the presence of peptides TASHD and Ser-Gaba-His-Gaba-Asp was observed. Kinetic studies of the hydrolysis of p-NPA in the presence of peptide TASHD using a variety of concentrations of substrate and peptide are reported. A series of measurements of initial rates of hydrolysis of p-NPA in the presence of peptide TASHD provided no evidence for saturation kinetics. Treatment of peptide TASHD with the serine-protease inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) produced no retardation in the initial rates of hydrolysis of p-NPA. The second order rate constants for the two peptides fell on the Br\xc3\xb8nsted line for a variety of substituted imidazoles from the literature. Our interpretation of these findings is that the peptides are behaving as simple imidazole catalysts for the hydrolysis of p-NPA and that there is no evidence for the involvement of the serine residue side chain during catalysis or any substrate binding by these peptides.

"The anticancer drug actinomycin D (ActD) binds to DNA by intercalating its phenoxazone ring at a GpC step with the drug\'s two cyclic pentapeptides located in the DNA minor groove. The binding affinity to the GpC site is influenced by the flanking sequences. We have analyzed the structure of the complexes of ActD\xe2\x88\x92d(GAAGCTTC)2 and ActD\xe2\x88\x92d(GATGCTTC)2 by NOE-restrained refinement. Binding of ActD to the \xe2\x88\x92(AGCT)2\xe2\x88\x92 sequence causes the N-methyl group of MeVal to wedge between the bases at the ApG step, resulting in kinks on both sides of the intercalator site. Surprisingly ActD forms a very stable complex with d(GATGCTTC)2 in which the same methyl group now fits snugly in a cavity at the TpG step created by the T:T mismatched base pair. In contrast, ActD does not stabilize the unstable A:A\xe2\x88\x92mismatched d(GAAGCATC)2 duplex to a significant extent. Such high-resolution structural information helps reveal the sequence preference of ActD toward \xe2\x88\x92XGCY\xe2\x88\x92 tetranucleotides. The triplet repeat (CAG)n and (CTG)n motifs, which are associated with several genetic diseases such as Huntington\'s disease/spinobulbar muscular atrophy and myotonic dystrophy, contain \xe2\x88\x92AGCA\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x88\x92TGCT\xe2\x88\x92 sequences. It was found by NMR spectroscopic studies that ActD significantly stabilizes the mismatched (CAG)n and (CTG)n duplexes and prevents them from annealing with each other to form the Watson\xe2\x88\x92Crick duplex. This suggests that ActD may trap the cruciform structure of the (CAG)n/(CTG)n sequence and may exert certain biological actions (e.g., stopping the expansion during replication), since interference of the equilibrium between the duplex and cruciform structures by proteins or drugs may have biological consequences.

"Rates of hydrolysis of succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide catalyzed by subtilisin and its N155G mutant were measured in H2O, D2O, and \xe2\x80\x9cHDO\xe2\x80\x9d (1:1 H2O:D2O). The solvent isotope effects (proton inventories) determined by these data showed no differences between the wild-type and mutant enzymes, despite the fact that the mutation removes a hydrogen-bonding interaction in the oxyanion hole of the enzyme worth two orders of magnitude in reaction rate. This suggests that curvature previously observed (ref 10) in the proton inventory for a reaction catalyzed by methyl chymotrypsin is also not due to oxyanion hole interactions, and this curvature can in fact be accounted for by a medium effect. Proton inventory analysis of the isotope effects for subtilisin and its mutant also indicate the presence of strong medium effects in those systems. "
"The synthetically useful cyanocuprates MeCu(CN)Li (2) and \xe2\x80\x9cMe2CuLi\xc2\xb7LiCN\xe2\x80\x9d (3) have been characterized by infrared spectroscopy. Titration of CuCN\xc2\xb72LiCl (1) with MeLi in THF solution has established that 2 has an IR absorption due to cyanide stretching at 2133 cm-1 with \xce\xb5 = 2.3 \xc3\x97 103 cm-2 M-1, while the CN stretching frequency for 3 occurs at 2115 cm-1 with \xce\xb5 = 4.0 \xc3\x97 102 cm-2 M-1. The spectra suggest that 2 and 3 are the only significant cuprate species present in the methylcyanocuprate system. The IR titration data give a formation constant of approximately 8 \xc3\x97 103 for 2 + MeLi \xe2\x87\x8c 3. The present data stand in contrast to earlier reports that 2 and 3 have identical IR spectra. The earlier conclusion appears to have been a consequence of the significantly different molar absorptivity of cyanide in 2 and 3 and the presence of small amount of 2 in equilibrium with 3 when the MeLi:CuCN ratio is 2:1. Ab initio calculations of the frequencies and intensities of the CN stretch are able to semiquantitatively reproduce the observed trends using a model in which the CN- is bound to the Cu in 2 but is not bound directly to the Cu in 3. The predicted CN stretch for a \xe2\x80\x9chigher order\xe2\x80\x9d cyanocuprate structure, with a three-coordinate [Me2CuCN]2-, is not consistent with the observed value. In contrast, the seven-membered bridged Gilman cuprate 14 appears to fulfill all of the structural and IR spectroscopic requirements for the 2115 cm-1 species. "
"The head-to-head dimer of the calicheamicin oligosaccharide domain exhibits an impressive nanomolar affinity for its specific DNA recognition sites and a substantially higher degree of sequence selectivity relative to the oligosaccharide monomer. In an effort to determine the structural basis for these binding properties, the solution structure of the 1:1 complex between the head-to-head dimer and the self-complementary oligonucleotide d(CGTAGGATATCCTACG)2 has been solved using 1H NMR-derived distance and torsion angle constraints and molecular dynamics calculations. Complete sequence specific proton assignments of both the DNA duplex and the carbohydrate have been obtained by 2D-NMR. A total of 607 experimentally derived constraints were identified including 452 proton\xe2\x88\x92proton distance constraints derived from NOESY cross peaks intensities and assigned hydrogen bonds, along with 155 dihedral angle constraints obtained from a detailed analysis of the multiplet structure of cross-peaks for the sugar rings and from qualitative analysis of nuclear Overhauser effects for the DNA backbone. The final conformation of the complex is represented by an ensemble of seven structures (the average all-atom root mean square deviation from the mean is 1.07 \xc3\x85 in the well-defined region) obtained by refining 14 initial conformations with widely different nonstandard DNA geometries. A number of favorable interactions are found to stabilize the structure of the complex and account for binding sequence preferences. Overall, the binding mode of each oligosaccharide unit of the head-to-head dimer in the DNA minor groove seems to be very close to that observed in the case of the monomeric calicheamicin oligosaccharide bound to its corresponding TCCT recognition site. Variable temperature NMR studies have shown that this dimer binds to d(CGTAGGATATCCTACG)2 in two subtly different conformations, probably differing in the positioning of rings E and E\xe2\x80\x98, interconverting with a rate constant of \xe2\x88\xbc0.35 s-1. The solution structure of this carbohydrate\xe2\x88\x92DNA complex provides confirmation of design principles for new calicheamicin-based DNA-binding agents and confirms insights obtained previously into the molecular basis for oligosaccharide recognition within the DNA minor groove.

"Recent advances in the application of kinetic isotope effects to enzyme-catalyzed reactions have provided reliable information for enzymatic transition state structures. A method is presented for quantifying the similarity of substrates and inhibitors with their enzyme-stabilized transition states. On the basis of transition-state stabilization theory for enzymatic reactions, molecules most similar to the transition state structure bind with greatest affinity. Molecular similarity measures are applied to compare substrates, competitive inhibitors, and transition state inhibitors with the transition state structures stabilized by the enzymes AMP deaminase, adenosine deaminase, and AMP nucleosidase. (R)- and (S)-Coformycin 5\xe2\x80\x98-phosphate are inhibitors for AMP deaminase, with the R-species superior to its enantiomer. Formycin 5\xe2\x80\x98-phosphate 4-aminopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-1-ribonucleotide, and tubercidin 5\xe2\x80\x98-phosphate inhibit AMP nucleosidase. The transition state for adenosine deaminase is analogous to that for AMP deaminase, allowing analysis of the tight-binding hydrate of purine ribonucleoside and of a weaker inhibitor, 1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside. The basis for ranking molecules for similarity to the transition state is the distribution of electrostatic potential at the molecular van der Waals surface. Spatial properties of a molecule are described through the topography of the surface, while the electrostatics capture ionic, hydrogen-bonding, and hydrophobic features. A test molecule is compared with the transition state by orienting the two species so that their van der Waals surfaces are maximally coincident. At this orientation, a single measure sensitive both to the electrostatic potential and its spatial distribution is used to rank the electronic similarity. For AMP deaminase, adenosine deaminase, and AMP nucleosidase, the transition state inhibitors are quantitatively more similar to the transition states than are the substrates. A strong correlation between the binding free energies and the similarity measures is found for most of the transition-state inhibitors in all three enzyme systems. This method is useful in the logical design of transition state inhibitors and may be applied to similarity searches of chemical libraries. "
"Individual enantiomers of substituted cyclohexyl diazoacetates or 2-octyl diazoacetates matched with a configurationally suitable chiral dirhodium(II) carboxamidate catalyst provide an effective methodology for the synthesis of lactones with exceptional diastereo- and regiocontrol. Enantiomerically pure (1S,2R)-cis-2-methylcyclohexyl diazoacetate forms the all-cis-(1R,5R,9R)-9-methyl-2-oxabicyclo[4.3.0]nonan-3-one with complete diastereocontrol in reactions catalyzed by dirhodium(II) tetrakis[methyl 1-(3-phenylpropanoyl)-2-oxoimidazolidine-4(R)-carboxylate], Rh2(4(S)-MPPIM)4, but the configurational mismatch results in a mixture of products. The same diazoacetate produces (1S,5R)-5-methyl-2-oxabicyclo[4.3.0]nonan-3-one with virtually complete selectivity by catalysis with dirhodium(II) tetrakis[methyl 2-oxopyrrolidine-5(S)-carboxylate], Rh2(5(S)-MEPY)4. Similarly high stereo- and regiocontrol is also achieved with enantiomerically pure trans-2-methylcyclohexyl diazoacetates. Product control from insertion reactions of d- or l-menthyl diazoacetate and (+)-neomenthyl diazoacetate from the configurational match with dirhodium(II) catalyst results in the formation of one C\xe2\x88\x92H insertion product in high yield. The exceedingly high product diastereoselection observed in these reactions is consistent with virtually exclusive insertion into equatorial C\xe2\x88\x92H bonds. The catalyst-dependent selective formation of a cis-disubstituted \xce\xb3-butyrolactone or a \xce\xb2-lactone from 2-octyl diazoacetate has been achieved. Control of product diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity in C\xe2\x88\x92H insertion reactions is explained by conformational suitability in configurational match/mismatch of catalyst and carbene.

"The preparation and modification of highly functionalized polyether dendrimers containing a versatile diethyl isophthalate terminal group is presented. The convergent synthesis consists of the construction of diester-terminated dendrons containing benzylic bromide functions at the focal point and their subsequent attachment to 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenol cores. Dendrons up to the third generation can be prepared using recrystallization alone as the primary means of purification, allowing the synthesis to be performed on the scale of tens to hundreds of grams. The third and fourth generation bidendron dendrimers (with 32 and 64 terminal ester functionalities, respectively) have been subjected to a variety of surface modification reactions including hydrolysis, ester interchange, and amide\xe2\x88\x92ester interchange, many of which proceed with complete conversion of the functional groups and in high isolated yield. The addition of alcohols such as benzyl alcohol or a first generation 3,5-di(benzyloxy)benzyl alcohol dendron to the dendrimer surface serves to increase the generation number of the dendrimers by one or two in what amounts to a \xe2\x80\x9cdouble convergent growth\xe2\x80\x9d approach. The analysis of these structurally precise dendrimers by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight is described. "
"The synthesis of 9,9-difluoro-1,2,9,9a-tetrahydrocyclopropa[c]benz[e]indol-4-one (F2CBI), a difluorocyclopropane analog of the CC-1065 and duocarmycin alkylation subunits which represents the first such agent containing substitution of the reactive center in the natural products, is detailed. The core structure of F2CBI was prepared by an intramolecular metal carbenoid insertion reaction into a 1,1-difluoroalkene (74%) employing a p-quinonediazide, and its incorporation into F2CBI-TMI (24) provided a key analog of the duocarmycins. A study of the solvolysis of N-BOC-F2CBI (19) revealed that introduction of the difluorocyclopropane substitution increased the reactivity 500\xc3\x97 without altering the inherent regioselectivity which occurred with nucleophilic addition to the difluoro substituted C9 cyclopropane carbon. A single-crystal X-ray structure analysis of 17 and its comparison with the X-ray structures of CBI and related agents beautifully reveal the structural origin of the difluoro substitution effects on the reactivity and regioselectivity of the cyclopropane cleavage reaction. The cyclopropane C\xe2\x88\x92CF2\xe2\x88\x92C bond angle is expanded, and the carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon bond opposite the difluoro substitution is lengthened to accommodate the preferentially compressed exocyclic F\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92F bond angle introducing additional strain energy. Consistent with this increased reactivity and following trends established to date, the agents were found to be 500\xe2\x88\x921000\xc3\x97 less cytotoxic than the corresponding CBI derivative lacking the difluorocyclopropane substitution. Similarly, the gem difluoro substitution had no perceptible effect on the DNA alkylation selectivity of the agents, and they were found to undergo the characteristic adenine N3 addition to the C9 cyclopropane carbon but did so with a reduced (675\xe2\x88\x92725\xc3\x97) efficiency following the cytotoxicity and stability correlations.

"Cyclopentadienylidenetrimethylenemethane radical anion 4, the one-electron reduction product of the corresponding diradical 3, was generated by a gas phase ion-molecule reaction of 6,6-dimethylfulvene (5) with O\xe2\x80\xa2-. Characterization was carried out by isotopic labeling to confirm the distonic structure of the radical anion. The results suggest that negative ion photoelectron spectroscopic experiments can be used to resolve a conflict between theories regarding the nature (singlet or triplet) of the ground state of 3. In reactivity studies, the radical anion 4 is a better nucleophile than its corresponding anion 6, a result similar to that found for the tetramethyleneethane radical anion 1. The basicity of the radical anion 4 has been bracketed at approximately 354 \xc2\xb1 3 kcal/mol. This study contains the first evidence that a distonic radical anion can react as a radical as well as an anion, a result that will lead to further gas phase examination of the radicals in the distonic ion series.

"Intense vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) bands for the azide antisymmetric stretching vibration in the azide complex of a C2-chiral strapped iron porphyrin have been observed with anisotropy values of ca. 2 \xc3\x97 10-3. This is the first case in which the extremely strong VCD band has been measured for a ligand vibration of iron porphyrin without an apo-protein. The VCD spectrum of myoglobin azide shortly after reconstitution with its own heme exhibited a weak band but over time the intensity with negative sign gradually recovered. The combination of these two results suggests that the chiral environment produced by the peripheral substituents on the porphyrin ring, which give rise to a diastereotopic plane, is responsible for the generation of the intense VCD in hemoproteins whereas specific interactions of distal residues with the porphyrin ring and the ligands in halo-proteins are not always necessary.

"This study reports experimentally and theoretically (ab initio) determined indirect CC spin\xe2\x88\x92spin coupling tensors nJCC in benzene. The CC spin\xe2\x88\x92spin coupling constants nJCC between the ortho, meta, and para (n = 1, 2, and 3) positioned carbons were experimentally determined in two ways:\xe2\x80\x89 firstly by utilizing the 2H/1H isotope effect on the carbon shieldings in neat monodeuteriobenzene and recording the 13C satellite spectrum in a 1H-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum, and secondly by recording the 13C NMR spectrum of fully 13C-enriched benzene (13C6H6) and carrying out its complete analysis. The anisotropies of the corresponding coupling tensors, \xce\x94nJCC, were resolved experimentally by liquid crystal 1H and 13C NMR using dipolar couplings corrected for both harmonic vibrations and deformations. The results obtained in three thermotropic liquid crystal solvents are in good mutual agreement, indicating the reliability of the determinations. The anisotropy of the ortho, meta, and para CC indirect couplings are ca. +17, \xe2\x88\x924, and +9 Hz, respectively. Also, the signs of the coupling constants are unambiguously determined. The ab initio calculations were performed using multiconfiguration self-consistent field linear response theory with both single-reference and multireference wave functions. The results confirm the signs of the experimental anisotropies in all cases. The magnitude of the ortho coupling anisotropy is excellently reproduced, but the anisotropies are somewhat overestimated in the two other theoretical coupling tensors. The importance of the different physical contributions to the couplings and anisotropies is discussed. "
"The amide\xe2\x88\x92water hydrogen exchange rates of the individual backbone amide protons are very sensitive to the local environment of the protons and can be used to probe fluctuations in the local conformations of proteins. Hydrogen exchange between N-methylacetamide (NMA) and water is important in that it serves as a model for the amide\xe2\x88\x92water hydrogen exchange in peptides and proteins. The rate constants for amide\xe2\x88\x92water hydrogen exchange between 16 mol % NMA and water at 66 \xc2\xb0C were measured at pressures ranging from 1 bar to 5 kbar at three different pH values using the NMR magnetization transfer technique, and the apparent activation volumes of hydrogen exchange were obtained at each pH. The activation volume of the acid-catalyzed hydrogen exchange reaction was calculated to be +1.7 cm3 mol-1, and the activation volume of the base-catalyzed hydrogen exchange reaction was calculated to be +11.0 cm3 mol-1. The hydrogen exchange rate constants were also measured as a function of concentration and pH at ambient pressure at 66 \xc2\xb0C so that the rate constants of the acid-, base-, and uncatalyzed hydrogen exchange reactions could be found. With these values, the activation volume of the uncatalyzed hydrogen exchange reaction was calculated to be equal to \xe2\x88\x929.0 cm3 mol-1. This quantity has not been previously determined and is required in hydrogen exchange studies of peptides and proteins at pressures above ambient pressure. "
"The interaction between urea and tetrabutylammonium acetate was investigated in dimethylformamide/dimethyl sulfoxide solutions using 1H and 15N NMR. The chemical-shift behavior of the urea protons is consistent with a urea-acetate hydrogen-bonded complex involving both carboxylate oxygens and the urea hydrogens trans to the carbonyl oxygen with Kassoc = 120 \xc2\xb1 10. Line shape analysis of the temperature-dependent 1H NMR spectra show that \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 for rotation about the C\xe2\x88\x92N bond of urea changes only slightly from 11.0 \xc2\xb1 0.1 to 11.2 \xc2\xb1 0.1 kcal/mol on 1:1 molar addition of tetrabutylammonium acetate to a dilute solution of urea. A parallel investigation of the interaction of thiourea with tetrabutylammonium acetate gave a binding constant, Kassoc = 90 \xc2\xb1 10. The \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 for rotation about the C\xe2\x88\x92N bond of thiourea was found to increase from 13.5 \xc2\xb1 0.1 to 14.0 \xc2\xb1 0.1 kcal/mol on 1:1 addition of tetrabutylammonium acetate to a dilute solution of thiourea in dimethylformamide/dimethyl sulfoxide. Measurements were also made of the self-association of several ureas and of \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 for rotation about both C(O)\xe2\x88\x92N bonds of 1,1-dimethylurea. "
"Ab initio HF-SCF calculations of the equilibrium geometries, energies, and 13C NMR shifts of various monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric aggregates of the lithium ester enolate of methyl isobutyrate (MIB-Li) were performed. It is shown that an enolate-like nonplanar structure of the MIB-Li monomer, in which a \xcf\x80-interaction between the Li atom and CC double bond is realized, is more stable than the planar enolate-like structure. The energies of the two MIB-Li dimers consisting of the planar and nonplanar MIB-Li monomers, respectively, were found to be nearly the same. However, the experimental 13C NMR shifts for the MIB-Li dimer in THF agree with those calculated for the planar stereoisomer. For the MIB-Li tetramer, two structures were found, namely, a cubic and a nearly flat eight-membered-ring structure. The calculated 13C NMR shifts for the two tetramers are very similar, but the cubic tetramer is considerably more stable than the flat one at the highest level of theory. Semiempirical MNDO and PM-3 calculations of both specific and nonspecific solvation energies of MIB-Li aggregates solvated by THF were carried out. It was found that the solvation effects decrease in the series monomer > dimer > tetramer. The calculated total solvation energies for MIB-Li aggregates are used to estimate the solvent effects on the ab initio relative energies of the aggregates. "
"The ab initio shielding calculations are carried out to investigate the conformation dependence of 13C chemical shifts for conjugated compounds like the chromophore of a visual pigment rhodopsin (Rh). First, the calculations are applied systematically to 10 diene derivatives to obtain basic and universal relationships between their conformation and the shieldings of unsaturated carbons. It is indicated that the conjugated carbons are classified into two types according to the profiles of conformation dependence of the shieldings. The shieldings of the carbons forming the rotating bond exhibit complicated angular dependence. It is rigorously evidenced that the behavior of such carbon shieldings can be understood by considering the effect of \xcf\x80-orbital modification, a new concept introduced here. On the other hand, the shieldings of the other carbons essentially follow well-known mechanisms including the steric and charge density effects. One of the most important findings is that the steric effects are reflected predominantly on the \xcf\x8311 component, and the effects originated in electronic perturbation are on the \xcf\x8322 and \xcf\x8333 ones. This classification is hardly disturbed even when both types of effects simultaneously act during a conformational change. It is indicated that these basic data for the dienes are available to interpret the conformation dependence of 13C shieldings for more complicated compounds like retinal. Finally, combining the data for the direct ab initio shielding calculations of 11-cis-retinal and for those of the dienes, we successfully determine the preferred conformation around the C12\xe2\x88\x92C13 bond of the chromophore in Rh. It is concluded that the chromophore takes s-trans conformation around the C12\xe2\x88\x92C13 bond. "
"The recent synthesis of (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)osmium(VI) pentahydride (Cp*OsH5) completes the series of high-oxidation-state cyclopentadienyl metal polyhydrides. A single hydride resonance in the proton NMR spectrum indicated that the complex contained either five equivalent hydride ligands or inequivalent hydrides in rapid exchange. Vibrational studies were inconclusive as to whether the molecule adopted a C5v (pseudo-pentagonal-pyramid with the Cp ring occupying the axial position) or a pseudo-C4v (pseudo-octahedral with the Cp ring considered as occupying one site) orientation in the ground state. In this study, ab initio calculations with effective core potentials were performed on pentahydrido(cyclopentadienyl)osmium(VI), CpOsH5, to determine its structure, vibrational spectrum, and rearrangement mechanism. Geometry optimizations at the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock (HF) and second-order M\xc3\xb8ller\xe2\x88\x92Plesset (MP2) levels of theory and energy calculations at the MP3, configuration interaction singles and doubles (CISD), coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD), and coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative estimate of triple excitations (CCSD(T)) levels place the pseudo-C4v structure lower in energy than the C5v structure. When compared to the experimental results, the calculated frequencies confirm that the pseudo-C4v geometry is the experimentally observed conformation. The topography of the MP2 potential energy surface supports the notion of a highly fluxional pseudo-C4v geometry which exchanges hydride ligands through a Bailar or trigonal-twist mechanism without passing through the C5v geometry.

"The possibility of successive Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder cycloadditions of 1,3-butadiene to C60 has been studied theoretically by means of the AM1 semiempirical method. The nine unique possible reaction pathways leading to the experimentally observed Th-symmetric hexakisadduct have been described, and the most thermodynamically favored has been analyzed in more detail. The enthalpy barrier for the cycloaddition changes from 16.2 kcal/mol in the formation of the monoadduct to 17.8 kcal/mol for the hexakisadduct, increasing slightly with successive attacks. However, once the hexakisadduct is reached, addition of a new 1,3-butadiene has an enthalpy barrier as high as 35.5 kcal/mol, in agreement with the fact that experimentally the heptakisadduct has not yet been observed.

"The importance of a solvent in regulating the adhesion forces between surfaces is studied quantitatively with scanning force microscopy. Both samples and tips are coated with alkyl thiolate monolayers of type HS(CH2)10Y and force measurements are conducted as a function of terminal group Y (Y = CH2CH3, CH2OCH3, CO2CH3, CO(NH2), CO2H, and CH2OH) and solvent (water, ethanol, and n-hexadecane). Adhesive forces in water span the greatest range (0.30\xe2\x88\x9212.5 nN), with hydrophobic surfaces adhering most strongly and hydrophilic surfaces most weakly. In ethanol the adhesive forces are substantially smaller and in n-hexadecane they are negligible. In water, these adhesive forces are consistent with the work required to exclude solvent from the tip\xe2\x88\x92sample interface, indicating that solvent exclusion dominates adhesion. Such macroscopic solvent exclusion cannot fully explain the adhesive forces in ethanol. This force data is used to evaluate the tip\xe2\x88\x92sample interfacial energies (\xce\xb3ts) of like CH3- and CH2OCH3-terminated surfaces and the surface\xe2\x88\x92vacuum interfacial energies (\xce\xb3sv) of the hydrophilic surfaces. An effective tip radius of \xe2\x88\xbc30 nm and contact area of \xe2\x88\xbc10 nm2 (or \xe2\x88\xbc50 contacting molecules) is estimated from the adhesion between methyl groups in water. Since solvent exclusion regulates adhesion between these model organic surfaces, it provides a source of chemical contrast in force imaging. We explore this chemical contrast with friction force measurements of co-block polyethylene glycol\xe2\x88\x92polyamide polymer surfaces. "
"A novel electrochemical detection scheme for channel electrophoresis has been developed. A microfabricated array of individually addressed microelectrodes has been used as a site-specific amperometric detector for continuous separations in a buffer-filled rectangular channel. Continuous separations of picomole quantities of dopamine and catechol by channel electrophoresis with this new detection scheme have been demonstrated. Dopamine, an electroactive neurotransmitter, has been continuously monitored for 60 min with the electrochemical array detector. The new detection technique should allow dynamic chemical events in volume-limited microenvironments (i.e. single cells) to be examined with channel electrophoresis. "
"A phenoxynaphthacenequinone photoisomerizable monolayer was assembled onto an Au electrode. The resulting \xe2\x80\x9ctrans\xe2\x80\x9d-quinone monolayer exhibits poor electrochemical reversibility due to a nondensely-packed configuration. Treatment of the trans-quinone monolayer with 1-tetradecanethiol yields a densely-packed monolayer that exhibits electrochemical reversibility. The electrochemical response of the trans-quinone monolayer electrode is pH-dependent, consistent with a two-electron and two-proton redox process. Photoisomerization of the trans-quinone monolayer (305 nm < \xce\xbb < 320 nm) generates the ana-quinone monolayer that lacks electrochemical activity. Upon photoisomerization of the ana-quinone monolayer to the trans-quinone state (\xce\xbb>430 nm), the electroactivity of the monolayer is restored. By cyclic photoisomerization of the electrode between the ana- and trans-quinone states, reversible amperometric transduction of the recorded optical signals was accomplished. Coupling of redox-active materials, such as Fe(CN)63- or N,N\xe2\x80\x98-dibenzyl-4,4\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridinium (BV2+) to the photoisomerizable electroactive monolayer electrode allows vectorial electron transfer and amplification of the electrical response of the trans-quinone monolayer by the electrocatalyzed reduction of Fe(CN)63- or BV2+. The vectorial electron transfer from the trans-quinone monolayer to BV2+ is gated by the pH of the medium. The trans-quinone monolayer electrode was coupled to the redox mediator BV2+ and the enzyme nitrate reductase. In the presence of NO3-, the multicomponent system in the trans-quinone state leads to the bioelectrocatalyzed reduction of nitrate and the transduction of an amplified cathodic current. In this system, the vectorial reduction of BV2+ to BV+\xe2\x80\xa2 yields an electron mediator that activates the biocatalyzed process. By cyclic photoisomerization of the monolayer between the ana- and trans-quinone states, reversible light-induced activation and deactivation of the vectorial electron transfer in the system is accomplished. The functionalized electrode assemblies provide a means for the amplified amperometric transduction of recorded optical signals. "
"Melittin, the principal toxic component of bee venom, is a cationic, amphipathic, linear peptide composed of 26 amino acids, which exhibits unique structural and biological characteristics. It has high antimicrobial activity but also has the very detrimental property of killing eucaryotic cells, as illustrated by the lysis of sheep red cells. Several attempts have been made through synthesis of replacement analogs to advance the molecular understanding of the cause of these effects. We have now synthesized retro melittin, an amphipathic \xce\xb1-helical analog with reversal of sequence and therefore of the positions of charged and apolar residues, notably, the cluster of basic residues Lys21-Arg-Lys-Arg24 near the C-terminus which is now located at positions 3\xe2\x88\x926 near the amino terminus. This peptide retained high antimicrobial activity against a range of test bacteria, but lost much of its hemolytic properties. Modification of the N-terminal positive charge by acetylation did not further alter the antibacterial activity or red cell lysis. The synthetic retroenantio melittin (all-d isomer) and its acetylated derivative both retained full antibacterial activity, but with complete elimination of the hemolytic effect. Therefore, the two effects of melittin have been separated. Melittin and these analogs promote electrical conductivity in lipid bilayers. Circular dichroism measurements showed that all of these peptidesnormal, enantio, retro, retroenantio, and their acetylated derivativeswere 80\xe2\x88\x92100% helical in 12\xe2\x88\x9220% hexafluoro-2-propanol, a structure inducing solvent, and they are thought to be helical in lipid bilayers and bacterial membranes. Nonhelical analogs are inactive. It is believed that the helix dipole plays a major part in orienting the peptides in membranes. Active sequences are not unique, but sequence plays a role in peptide conformation and activity. Chirality has virtually no role in the antibacterial activity of normal and retro melittin analogs, which leads to the conclusion that these peptides do not function via a receptor or by enzymatic processing, but by self-aggregation and formation of ion-conducting pores.

"The third cytoplasmic loop of seven transmembrane helix receptors is important both for the coupling to and activation of the heterotrimeric G-protein. Here, the structural characterization of two peptides containing the sequence of the putative third cytoplasmic loop of the parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone related peptide receptor in aqueous solution and in the presence of micelles is presented. The 27-amino acid peptide has been examined both in a linear form and cyclized with a linker of 8 methylenes designed to maintain a distance of 12 \xc3\x85 between the N- and C-termini, modeling the distance observed between transmembrane \xce\xb1-helices in bacteriorhodopsin. In aqueous solution both peptides are relatively unstructured. In contrast, in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate micelles the linear peptide adopts a well-defined extended conformation with approximately 30% \xce\xb1-helix. The cyclic peptide possesses an N-terminal, ten amino acid \xce\xb1-helical domain followed by seven amino acids which protrude out in a well-defined loop. These results indicate the importance of the membrane environment and the role of the structural constraint achieved by cyclization; the octamethylene linker restricts the peptide to conformations possible while attached to transmembrane helices V and VI thus mimicking the conformation of the loop in the native receptor.

"The mechanism of the proton-coupled electron transfer reaction, + H+ \xe2\x86\x92 QA(QBH)- was studied in reaction centers (RCs) from the photosynthetic bacterium Rb. sphaeroides by substituting quinones with different redox potentials into the QA site. These substitutions change the driving force for electron transfer without affecting proton transfer rates or proton binding equilibria around the QB site. The measured rate constants, increased with increasing electron driving force (by a factor of 10 per 160 meV change in redox free energy). The proton-coupled electron transfer was modeled by (i) four possible two-step mechanisms in which electron transfer can precede or follow proton transfer and can be either the rate determining or fast step in the overall reaction and (ii) a one-step mechanism involving the concerted transfer of an electron and a proton. The free energy dependencies of these possible mechanisms were predicted using Marcus theory and were compared to the observed dependence. The two stepwise mechanisms in which proton transfer is rate limiting predict very different free energy dependencies from that observed. The stepwise mechanism in which rate limiting electron transfer is followed by fast proton transfer predicts a free energy dependence similar to, but significantly larger than, the observed dependence. Additional arguments are presented against this mechanism. Thus, these three two-step mechanisms are excluded by the experimental data. The best agreement with the experimental data is given by a two-step mechanism in which fast reversible proton transfer is followed by rate limiting electron transfer. For this mechanism the observed free energy dependence for can be fitted using reasonable parameters of the Marcus theory. The free energy dependence predicted using a simple model for a concerted reaction also provides a reasonable fit to the data. Although the two-step mechanism (2) fits slightly better to the experimental data than the concerted mechanism, the uncertainty in the assumed parameters precludes a definitive conclusion. Thus, we propose a mechanism for proton-coupled electron transfer in native RCs (called proton-activated electron transfer) in which complete or partial protonation of the semiquinone increases the rate of the reaction by increasing the driving force for electron transfer.

"New bioactive ecteinascidins (Et\'s) 597 (1), 583 (2), 594 (3), and 596 (4)putative biosynthetic precursors of previously described Et\'s [e.g., Et 743 (5)]were isolated from the Caribbean tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata. Structures assigned to these compounds based on spectroscopic data represent a novel series of Et\'s with l-cysteine or its \xce\xb1-oxo analog as unit C. The absolute configuration of the l-Cys unit of 1 was assigned by chiral GC, while a 2D ROESY (rotating-frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy) spectrum of its acetyl derivative 1a completed the assignment of the stereochemistry of 1 as 1R,2R,3R,4R,11R,13S,21S,1\xe2\x80\x98R.

"In polymers made from (E)- or (Z)-[1-D]propene with methyl alumoxane (MAO)-activated ansa-zirconocene catalysts, signals of deuterium-labeled mrrm pentads document that stereoerrors arise mainly from an isomerization of the Zr-bound chain end. Reduced D-atom redistribution in poly([2-D]propene) indicates a kinetic isotope effect of kH/kD \xe2\x89\x88 3 for the \xce\xb2-H/D transfer associated with the isomerization reaction. In all poly([1- and [2-D]propenes) studied, D-labeled mmmm pentads occur with a probability similar to that of D-labeled mrrm pentads; this observation requires further mechanistic clarification. Olefinic chain ends of polymers obtained with C2H4(thind)2ZrCl2-MAO from (E)- or (Z)-[1-D]propene deviate in their D-label distributions from the expected stereochemistry. Isomerization of the Zr-bound chain end, probably via a Zr-bound tertiary alkyl intermediate, thus contributes also to chain-growth termination. With the sterically hindered catalyst Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2)2ZrCl2-MAO, almost all chain terminations appear to occur via chain-end isomerization, which does not lead to stereoerrors here. With the high-performance catalyst Me2Si(2-Me-benz[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2-MAO, finally, no D-label is found in the mrrm and mmmm pentad signals; here, Zr-alkyl isomerization can apparently not compete with the high rate of olefin insertion.

"This contribution presents strategies for the optimization of supramolecular architecture aimed at controlling the organization of biomolecules at solid surfaces. Myoglobin, modified by site-directed mutagenesis to include a unique cysteine residue, is selectively chemisorbed to self-assembled haloalkylsilylated silica surfaces of varying n-alkyl chain length (n = 2, 3, 8, 11, 15) to yield a series of surface-immobilized recombinant protein assemblies. These supramolecular assemblies are probed using tapping mode atomic force microscopy, wettability measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and linear dichroism spectroscopy to determine how the individual components comprising these structures (substrate, silane coupling layer, and protein) influence macromolecular protein ordering and stability. Surface roughness is found to be a minor contributor in the determination of macromolecular ordering in these assemblies. In contrast, the nature of the underlying silane self-assembled coupling layer is shown to strongly influence both the spatial and functional properties of the chemisorbed protein. Silane coupling layers with short aliphatic chain lengths (n = 2, 3) produce highly trans-conformationally ordered structures upon which differential heme prosthetic group orientation can be achieved. Long alkyl chain (n \xe2\x89\xa5 11) silane-derivatized surfaces also form ordered structures. The stability of myoglobin appended to long chain aliphatic silylated surfaces is poor, however. The apparent protein instability arises due to the increased hydrophobic character of these films. At intermediate alkyl chain length (n = 8), a conformationally disordered coupling layer with a high concentration of gauche defects is produced, regardless of the method of silane deposition or postdeposition processing. Chemisorption of myoglobin to the highly disorganized assembly yields a random orientation of the protein. "
"The ground-state and the excited-state spectroscopic properties of four series of polymethylene-linked anthracene\xe2\x88\x92dialkylaniline bichromophores were compared as a probe to the relationship between energetics and distance in photoinduced electron transfer (PET). The results demonstrate that, when the energy level of the charge-transfer (CT) state is lowered below that of the localized excited state by appropriate substituents, there is a strong electron\xe2\x88\x92donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor (EDA) interaction in the ground state which is absent in other bichromophores. Absorption and fluorescence excitation studies revealed that there is an unusually strong EDA interaction in the ground state of A-2 which is absent in other members in the A series. When A-2 is excited directly into this EDA absorption, it exhibits two CT emissions, one at 490 nm and the other at 605 nm. The quantum yield (\xcf\x84f) and the lifetime (\xce\xa6f) of the two emissions are dependent on the viscosity of the alkane solvent. The \xce\xa6f and the \xcf\x84f of the 490 nm emission increased when the solvent viscosity was increased; however, those of the 605 nm emission remained essentially unchanged. The risetime of the 605 nm emission is 420 ps, but that of the 490 nm emission is instrument-function limiting. The results suggest that the two CT emissions may be derived from the two different conformations of the CT state. The 490 nm emission may be derived from the trans conformer of A-2, which is the major conformer at equilibrium. The EDA interaction in the trans conformer of A-2 may be treated as a type of through-\xcf\x83-bond interaction via the spacer between the n orbital of the anilino nitrogen and the \xcf\x80 orbital of the anthryl group. The direct excitation of A-2 from its EDA ground state to the CT state indicates that PET may occur in a \xcf\x83-linked bichromophoric system upon light absorption, thus reaching the limiting rate of a photochemical process.

"Double labeling has been used under the endocyclic restriction test to show that transfers of phosphorus from oxygen to carbon in the conversions of lithio phosphinite 1 to alkoxy phosphine 8, of lithio phosphinite 2 to alkoxy phosphine 9, of lithio phosphinate 3 to alkoxy phosphine oxide 10, and of lithio phosphinite borane 4 to alkoxy phosphine borane 11 proceed in an intramolecular fashion. The transfers of stereogenic phosphorus in the conversions of lithio phosphinite (R)-5 to alkoxy phosphine (R)-12, of lithio phosphinate (S)-6 to alkoxy phosphine oxide (S)-13, and of lithio phosphinite borane (R)-7 to alkoxy phosphine borane (R)-14 proceed with retention of stereochemistry at phosphorus. These results rule out the classic in-line SN2 pathway and the geometrically equivalent in-line addition\xe2\x88\x92elimination pathway for these endocyclic transfers of phosphorus. The most likely pathway for these nucleophilic substitutions at phosphorus is initial apical nucleophilic attack followed by pseudorotation and elimination of the apical alkoxy leaving group. "
"A practical route for the total synthesis of pumiliotoxin A alkaloids is described. The central step is formation of the piperidine ring and establishment of the (Z)-alkylidene side chain by an iodide-promoted iminium ion\xe2\x88\x92alkyne cyclization. The total synthesis of (+)-15(S)-pumiliotoxin A (2) was realized in 5 steps and 32% overall yield from alkyne 36 and epoxide 7. This synthesis of 2 proceeded in 13 steps and 12% overall yield from (S)-2-methyl-1-penten-3-ol (25) and 8 steps and 9% overall yield from N-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-l-proline. The synthesis of (+)-pumiliotoxin B (3) was similarly achieved in four steps and 44% overall yield from alkyne 54 and epoxide 7. The overall yield of enantiopure 3 was 8% from N-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-l-proline and 10% from (4S,5R)-4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone. These syntheses represent substantial improvement over previous routes to these important alkaloids. "
"A concise, stereocontrolled strategy for the total synthesis of allopumiliotoxin A alkaloids is described. A much improved second generation total synthesis of enantiopure (+)-allopumiliotoxin 267A (3) was accomplished in 10 steps and 11% overall yield from the commercially available oxazolidinone precursor of alcohol 32 and 17 steps and 4% overall yield from N-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-l-proline. The first synthesis of (+)-allopumiliotoxin 323B\xe2\x80\x98 (4) rigorously confirms the complete stereostructure of 4 and establishes that the major C(15) epimer isolated from dendrobatid frogs has the 15S configuration. The total synthesis of 4 was realized in 5 steps and 17% overall yield from alkyne 39 and aldehyde 20; the synthesis proceeded in 13 steps and 6% overall yield from (S)-2-methyl-1-penten-3-ol and 17 steps and 3.5% overall yield from N-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-l-proline, the precursors, respectively, of alkyne 39 and pyrrolidine aldehyde 20. The first total synthesis of allopumiliotoxin 339A (5) also confirmed the full stereostructure of this alkaloid. The synthesis of enantiopure 5 was achieved in 5 steps and 32% overall yield from alkyne 45 and pyrrolidine aldehyde 20; the synthesis proceeded in 17 steps and \xe2\x88\xbc7% overall yield from N-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-l-proline and 16 steps and \xe2\x88\xbc6% overall yield from the commercially available oxazolidinone precursor of 45. These syntheses provide the best illustrations to date of the substantial utility of iodide-promoted iminium ion\xe2\x88\x92alkyne cyclizations for constructing highly functionalized nitrogen heterocycles.

"Straight linear tetranuclear complexes have been prepared by using pyphos ligand (pyphos = 6-diphenylphosphino-2-pyridonate), which has unique coordinating sites comprised of three kinds of elements, i.e., phosphine, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms, in almost linear fashion. The starting complex is the quadruply bonded dinuclear molybdenum(II) complex, Mo2(pyphos)4 (1), which was prepared by the reaction of Mo2(OAc)4 with sodium salt of pyphos. Single crystal X-ray analysis revealed that 1 consists of quadruply-bonded Mo2 and trans-arranged diphosphine at both axial position of Mo2 core. Thus, transition metal can be expected to be placed at both axial positions of Mo2 core. Thus, treatment of 1 with Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes gave rise to tetranuclear complexes of the general formula, Mo2Pd2X4(pyphos)4 (2) and Mo2Pt2X4(pyphos)4 (4) (a:\xe2\x80\x89 X = Cl; b:\xe2\x80\x89 X = Br; c:\xe2\x80\x89 X = I). Single crystal X-ray analysis of 2a, 2b, and 4a revealed the structure of complexes 2 and 4 that consist of M(II)\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7MoMo\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7M(II) skeleton supported by four pyphos ligands. They have quadruply-bonded Mo2 core and no bonding between a M(II) atom and a Mo atom. Treatment of 2 and 4 with reducing reagents, photoirradiation, or thermal reduction resulted in the formation of metal\xe2\x88\x92metal bonded tetranuclear complexes Mo2Pd2X2(pyphos)4 (6) and Mo2Pt2X2(pyphos)4 (7) (a:\xe2\x80\x89 X = Cl; b:\xe2\x80\x89 X = Br; c:\xe2\x80\x89 X = I), respectively. All of them were characterized by single crystal X-ray analysis, which revealed that they consist of M(I)-MoMo-M(I) skeleton supported by pyphos ligands. The bond lengths between M(I) and Mo are short enough to be formally regarded as a single M(I)-Mo bond, while the longer Mo\xe2\x88\x92Mo distance compared to that of 1, 2, and 4 indicated that the Mo\xe2\x88\x92Mo bond of 6 and 7 are formally triple (\xcf\x802\xce\xb4 component). The electrochemical study indicates that all the atoms in the M\xe2\x88\x92Mo\xe2\x88\x92Mo\xe2\x88\x92M system are electronically strongly coupled to allow an effective 2-electron redox process, and thus the chemical reduction of 2 and 4 readily gives 6 and 7, respectively.

"The reaction of M(II) acetate hydrate (M = Co, Ni, and Zn) with 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic (BTC) acid yields a material formulated as M3(BTC)2\xc2\xb712H2O. These compounds are isostructural as revealed by their XRPD patterns and a single crystal structure analysis performed on the cobalt containing solid [monoclinic, space group C2, a = 17.482 (6) \xc3\x85, b = 12.963 (5) \xc3\x85, c = 6.559 (2) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 112.04\xc2\xb0, V = 1377.8 (8) \xc3\x85, Z = 4]. This solid is composed of zigzag chains of tetra-aqua cobalt(II) benzenetricarboxylate that are hydrogen-bonded to yield a tightly held 3-D network. Upon liberating 11 water ligands per formula unit a porous solid results, M3(BTC)2\xc2\xb7H2O, which was found to reversibly and repeatedly bind water without destruction of the framework. The proposed 1-D channels of the monohydrate have a pore diameter of 4 \xc3\x97 5 \xc3\x85, which is typical of those observed in zeolites and molecular sieves. The successful inclusion of ammonia into the porous solid was demonstrated. Larger molecules and others without a reactive lone pair are disallowed from entering the channels. "
"Two methods are described and illustrated for the measurement of organo\xe2\x88\x92cobalt bond homolysis energies through reactions of tetra(p-anisyl)porphyrinato cobalt(II), (TAP)CoII\xe2\x80\xa2, with organic radicals of the form \xe2\x80\xa2C(CH3)(R)CN in the presence of olefins. Thermodynamic values for bond homolysis have been determined directly for (TAP)Co-C(CH3)2CN (\xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 = 17.8\xc2\xb10.5 kcal mol-1, \xce\x94S\xc2\xb0 = 23.1 \xc2\xb1 1.0 cal K-1 mol-1) and (TAP)Co-CH(CH3)C6H5 (\xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 = 19.5 \xc2\xb1 0.6 kcal mol-1, \xce\x94S\xc2\xb0 = 24.5 \xc2\xb1 1.1 cal K-1 mol-1) from evaluation of the equilibrium constants for the dissociation process (Co\xe2\x88\x92R \xe2\x87\x8c CoII\xe2\x80\xa2 + R\xe2\x80\xa2) in chloroform. The bond homolysis enthalpy for (TAP)Co-C5H9 (\xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 = 30.9 kcal mol-1) was determined indirectly by measuring the thermodynamic values for the competition reaction (TAP)Co-C(CH3)2CN + C5H8 \xe2\x87\x8c (TAP)Co-C5H9 + CH2C(CH3)CN (\xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 = 0.9 \xc2\xb1 0.3 kcal mol-1) in conjunction with a thermochemical cycle. This indirect approach was also used to evaluate (TAP)Co-CH(CH3)C6H5 BDE (20.5 kcal mol-1) which agrees favorably with the value determined directly. When the Co\xe2\x88\x92R bond homolysis enthalpies are known from independent evaluation, these equilibrium measurements provide a method for evaluating relative heats of formation of organic radicals. Application of this approach gives 40.8 kcal mol-1 for the heat of formation of \xe2\x80\xa2C(CH3)2CN in chloroform. Success of these methods is dependent on fast abstraction of H\xe2\x80\xa2 from the organic radicals by (TAP)CoII\xe2\x80\xa2 to form (TAP)Co-H and rapid addition of (TAP)Co-H with olefins to form organocobalt complexes. Kinetic-equilibrium simulations utilizing reaction schemes for these processes provide an accurate description of the kinetic profiles and the equilibrium concentrations of solution species when the organic radical species achieve steady state.

"Molecular composite knots have been prepared from transition metal-assembled precursors via a Glaser acetylenic coupling reaction. The templating metal is copper(I), and the coordinating fragments incorporated into the final structure are 1,10-phenanthroline-type chelates. The compounds are composite knots as opposed to prime knots such as the classical trefoil knot. By combining two tied open-chain fragments in a cyclodimerization reaction, the simplest composite knots are obtained as a mixture of two topological diastereomers. The minimum number of crossing points used to represent the molecules in a plane is six. Due to the complexity of the entangled precursors and to the several cyclization possibilities, the formation yield of composite knots is only modest (\xe2\x88\xbc3%). On the other hand, the compound has been fully characterized by ES-MS (molecular weight, 4037.8) and by 1H NMR spectroscopy, including 2D NMR (NOESY). "
"A series of new, kinetically stable, crystalline superlattice compounds containing integral number of intergrown dichalcogenide layers were prepared through controlled crystallization of Ti/Se/Nb/Se superlattice reactants with designed compositional modulation. Discussed in this paper is a family of structural isomers with the overall stoichiometry of NbTiSe4. Specifically, the members of this series containing 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 9/9, 12/12, and 15/15 TiSe2/NbSe2 units as the unit cell of the superlattice were prepared as polycrystalline thin films oriented with the dichalcogenide layers perpendicular to the substrate surface. Low-angle diffraction data collected as a function of time and temperature reveal that the initial layered reactant contracts in the c-axis direction and that the interfaces become smoother during initial interdiffusion. Theta\xe2\x88\x92theta scans show a gradual decrease of the (00l) diffraction line widths of the growing compound as a function of annealing time and temperature indicating an increase in the c-axis domain size. High-angle rocking curve diffraction data show increasing c-axis orientation, suggesting TiSe2/NbSe2 crystal growth perpendicular to the substrate surface upon low-temperature annealing. The end products of this synthetic approach are high quality c-axis-oriented TiSe2/NbSe2 crystalline superlattices with designed structure resulting from relatively low-temperature annealing at 500 \xc2\xb0C. A working model for the formation of crystalline superlattices from the modulated reactants is presented which is consistent with the data. "
"The compounds [(i-Pr)2ATI]SnCl (1) and {[(i-Pr)2ATI]Sn}[\xce\xb75-C5H5)ZrCl2(\xce\xbc-Cl3)ZrCl2(\xce\xb75-C5H5)] (2) in which [(i-Pr)2ATI] = N-isopropyl-2-(isopropylamino)troponimine have been prepared and characterized by 1H, 13C, and 119Sn NMR spectroscopies and X-ray crystallography. Compounds 1 and 2 feature heterobicyclic C7N2Sn ring systems with basically three- and two-coordinate tin atoms, respectively. Solid state structures of 1 and 2 show weak Sn\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Cl interactions. The 119Sn NMR signal of 2 appears at a significantly lower field compared to that of 1. This is consistent with the reduction in coordination number at the Sn center of 2. The 1H NMR data also provide evidence for the formation of a more symmetric solution species with the removal of Cl- from 1. X-ray structural features of C7N2Sn moiety in [(i-Pr)2ATI]SnCl and the {[(i-Pr)2ATI]Sn}+ cation are very similar. The Sn\xe2\x88\x92N bond distances of {[(i-Pr)2ATI]Sn}+ cation are not indicative of any significant Sn\xe2\x88\x92N multiple bonding. The \xcf\x80-electrons of the C7N2Sn ring system, therefore, appears to be mostly delocalized over nitrogen and carbon atoms. "
"Isotope separation of 233U by anion exchange chromatography based on the U(IV)\xe2\x88\x92U(VI) exchange is studied. After long-distance migration, 233U enrichment is observed at the rear band boundary. To examine the isotope effects of 233U, 234U, and 238U, three-isotope plots of local enrichment factors are constructed for the isotopes contained in sample fractions of the eluted uranium band. The results clearly show an anomalous mass dependence for 233U. We previously reported that the even-mass nuclides 232U, 234U, 236U, and 238U show a regular mass-dependence in their isotope separation behaviors, while 235U does not fall on the same line. The isotope effects of the odd-mass nuclides 233U and 235U deviate from the linear mass dependence observed among the even-mass nuclides. The isotope effects observed in chemical exchange are shown to be closely related to the isotope shifts in the atomic spectra of uranium isotopes. "
"For a series of polyether/transition metal ion complexes, collisionally activated dissociation reactions that are mediated by the flexibility of the polyether and the number of coordination sites are reported. The metal ions are generated by a pulsed laser desorption technique, and collision-activated dissociation methods are used to characterize the structures of the resulting metal/polyether complexes. The CAD patterns for the different polyether/metal ion complexes show striking variations depending on the flexibility of the ether, its number of coordination sites, and the type of metal ion. For example, (18-crown-6 + Co+) dissociates by loss of CHCH\xe2\x80\xa2 or C2H3O\xe2\x80\xa2 radicals, each pathway in conjunction with multiple losses of C2H4O, and resulting in products incorporating one covalent or ionic bond between the Co+ ion and the crown ether. In contrast, (12-crown-4 + Co+) dissociates by loss of CH2CH2 or C2H4O closed shell neutrals, each pathway in conjunction with additional losses of C2H4O and resulting in products that incorporate no covalent bonds to Co+. The polyether/Ni+ complexes show dissociation behavior that is similar to that observed for the Co+ complexes, but the polyether/Cu+ complexes show uniform dissociation trends that seem to be independent of the flexibility and number of coordination sites of the ether. These differences are rationalized based on the nature of the metal ion, and both the flexibility of the crown ether and its number of coordinating sites, factors which affect the geometry during coordination of the metal ion. This idea is supported by comparative dissociation reactions of metal complexes containing acyclic polyethers (glymes) which have more flexible structures. MS/MS/MS experiments and CAD of complexes formed by model compounds offer support for the dissociation mechanisms. "
"In this paper we consider charge density waves in defective lattice structures. Just as in nondefective lattices, we find that the Fermi surface plays an important role in supercell dimensions. In particular, a correspondence is found between the Fermi surfaces of the defective and the nondefective lattices. The concept of an effective band filling is introduced, which may be understood as the band filling for which the fully occupied lattice mimics the Fermi surface of the partially occupied lattice. To demonstrate the efficacy of this method, the superstructures of La10Se19, Cs3Te22, RbDy3Se8, and Dy65.33Se120 are studied. Fermi surfaces from both H\xc3\xbcckel and extended H\xc3\xbcckel tight-binding theories allow the rationalization of the defect lattice structures found in these systems. Finally a simple model based only on nearest neighbor interaction is found to preserve most of the essential features of the H\xc3\xbcckel and extended H\xc3\xbcckel treatments. "
"Aspartic acid and asparagine residues racemize rapidly relative to other amino acid residues in proteins and peptides. This has been attributed to the increased acidity of the \xce\xb1-carbons of succinimide residues derived from the spontaneous cyclizations of these residues. To understand the basis of this effect, the acidities of model compounds were calculated using ab initio quantum mechanics (RHF/6-31+G*). The results were also checked with DFT (Becke3LYP/6-31+G*) and solvent cavity models (IPCM and SCIPCM). The geometries of succinimide, 2-pyrrolidinone, and the derived enolate anions were optimized, and the gas phase deprotonation energies were calculated. The imide is more acidic than the amide by 18 kcal/mol in the gas phase. Since there is a qualitative correlation between gas phase and aqueous acidities, this result provides an explanation for the experimental observations that the rate of peptidyl succinimide racemization can be \xe2\x88\xbc105 times greater than that of unmodified aspartic acid residues. To quantitate the source of the succinimide acidity, the geometries and CH acidities of various conformations of N-formylacetamide and acetamide, acyclic models of succinimide and 2-pyrrolidinone, and 3-oxobutanal and acetone, acyclic models lacking the nitrogen atom, were studied. The importance of resonance effects for increasing the acidity of the \xce\xb1-carbon of succinimide was established, but electrostatic and inductive effects also have an important influence on acidities. The acidity of succinimide is compared to the acidities of several peptide models. Isosuccinimide, an alternative degradation product of aspartic acid and asparagine residues, is also be expected to be racemization prone by similar mechanisms. "
"Results are presented from 500 ps molecular dynamics simulations on the native dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 and the lesioned dodecamer containing a cis,syn-thymine cyclobutane dimer at the TT step. The computations, performed with AMBER4.1, included explicitly represented solvent with periodic boundary conditions applied within the constant temperature and pressure algorithm. Electrostatic interactions were calculated with the particle-mesh Ewald method. Distortions to DNA structure produced by the lesion were found to be localized at the dimer site and include mainly a substantial kink in the helical axis, rolled and tilted base pairs, and weakened hydrogen bonding at the 5\xe2\x80\x98 base pair of the lesion. A slight change in orientation around the glycosyl bond for the 5\xe2\x80\x98 thymine of the lesion and highly stiffened deoxyribose rings for both thymine bases were also observed. The global curvature of DNA is increased by about 10\xc2\xb0 by dimer incorporation. Calculations of H(1\xe2\x80\x98)-H(6)(pyrimidine) and H(1\xe2\x80\x98)-H(8)(purine) interproton distances from the performed simulations agree very well with the pattern of NMR NOE signals reported in various dimer containing oligonucleotides, where an interruption of NOE connectivities is found on the 5\xe2\x80\x98 side of the lesion. Comparison of the pattern of distortions observed at the dimer site with the crystal structure of a complex between dimer-containing DNA and repair enzyme endonuclease V (Cell 1995, 83, 773\xe2\x88\x92782) leads to the hypothesis that dimer recognition may involve a whole pattern of small distortion at the lesion site rather than one particular structural/dynamical feature associated with the lesion.

"Hexagonal mesoporous titanosilicates with distinguishable framework charges and textural mesoporosity, namely, Ti-MCM-41 and Ti-HMS, were prepared at ambient temperature by electrostatic and neutral assembly processes, respectively. Titanium incorporation at the 2 mol % level for both materials was accompanied by increases in lattice parameters and wall thicknesses, but the framework pore sizes remained unaffected. Cross-linking of the anionic framework of as-synthesized Ti-substituted MCM-41 prepared by electrostatic S+I- and S+X-I+ assembly pathways (where S+ is a quaternary ammonium surfactant and I- and I+ are ionic silicon precursors) was enhanced significantly by Ti substitution, as judged by 29Si MAS NMR. The neutral framework of as-synthesized Ti-HMS formed by S\xc2\xb0I\xc2\xb0 assembly (where S\xc2\xb0 is a primary amine and I\xc2\xb0 is a neutral silicon precursor) exhibited the same high degree of cross-linking as the unsubstituted silica analog. UV\xe2\x88\x92vis and XANES spectra for the calcined forms of Ti-MCM-41 and Ti-HMS indicated (i) the presence of site-isolated Ti species in the framework, (ii) predominantly tetrahedral coordination for Ti, along with some rehydrated five- and six-coordinated sites, and (iii) Ti siting that was virtually independent of the framework assembly pathway. All mesoporous molecular sieves exhibited catalytic activities superior to that of titanium silicalite for the liquid phase peroxide oxidations of methyl methacrylate, styrene, and 2, 6-di-tert-butylphenol. The exceptional catalytic activity in the case of Ti-HMS, especially toward larger substrates, was attributable to the small crystallite size and complementary textural mesoporosity that facilitates substrate access to framework Ti sites.

"Reductive activation of the bifunctional alkylator and DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MC) yields 2,7-diaminomitosene (2,7-DAM) as the major product of its activation both in cell-free systems and in vivo. 2,7-DAM lacks one of the alkylating functions of MC, the aziridine. We show that 2,7-DAM itself alkylates DNA monofunctionally upon reductive activation, to form a heat-labile adduct. A guanine-N7\xe2\x88\x922,7-DAM adduct was isolated from the drug\xe2\x88\x92DNA complex upon heating. Nuclease digestion yielded this adduct both in the nucleoside (dG-2,7-DAM) and dinucleoside phosphate [d(GpG)-2,7-DAM] forms. The structures of all three forms were determined by LC\xe2\x88\x92ESIMS and differential UV spectroscopy. The adduct is sequence-specific to guanines in (G)n tracts of DNA. A guanine-N7\xe2\x88\x922,7-DAM adduct in DNA was indirectly observed previously by Prakash et al. (Prakash, A. S.; Beall, H.; Ross, D.; Gibson, N. W. Biochemistry 1993, 32, 5518\xe2\x88\x925525). The results indicate that selective removal of the aziridine function of MC results in a switch from minor to major groove alkylation of DNA, and a switch of sequence specificity from guanines in CpG to guanines in (G)n tracts. They also show that the mitosene C-10 carbamate intrinsically reacts as an SN2 alkylating agent, specific to guanine-N7. "
"Serine-, threonine-, and cysteine-derived cyclic building blocks (pseudo-prolines, \xce\xa8Pro) serve as reversible protecting groups for Ser, Thr, and Cys and prove to be versatile tools for overcoming some intrinsic problems in the field of peptide chemistry. The presence of \xce\xa8Pro within a peptide sequence results in the disruption of \xce\xb2-sheet structures considered as a source of intermolecular aggregation during chain elongation, thus increasing solvation and coupling kinetics in peptide assembly. Due to their easy synthetic access and variability in the chemical stability by modifications introduced in the C-2 position of the oxazolidine/thiazolidine ring system, this protection technique is adaptable to all common strategies in peptide synthesis. We describe new types of \xce\xa8Pro building blocks suitable for standard Fmoc/tBu-based solid phase peptide synthesis, convergent strategies, and chemoselective ligation techniques as well as their use as a structure-disrupting, solubilizing protection technique for the example of peptides generally considered as \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult sequences\xe2\x80\x9d.

"The biosynthesis of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzamide in Streptomyces murayamaensis mutants MC2 and MC3 has been studied using sodium [1,2-13C2]- and [1-13C,18O2]acetate, sodium [2,3-13C2]succinate, [1,2-13C2]glutamic acid, [4-13C]aspartic acid, and sodium [1-13C]- and [2,3-13C2]pyruvate. 13C NMR analysis of the labeling patterns from the first two of these suggested a pathway via condensation of a four-carbon unit from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with a three-carbon unit, possibly phosphoenol pyruvate. Subsequent specific incorporations of the labeled succinic acid, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid confirmed the TCA cycle involvement and the orientation of the four-carbon intermediate. Specific incorporation of the labeled pyruvic acids confirmed the involvement of a three-carbon unit and defined its orientation. This is the first aminohydroxybenzoic acid derivative shown not to be derived from a shikimic acid-type pathway, and its origin provides a rationale for the biosynthesis of other microbial products such as asukamycin, manumycin, and the michigazones.

"Calf thymus DNA and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) were photooxidized in the dark by triplet-excited ketones generated in the thermal decomposition of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-3,4,4-trimethyl-1,2-dioxetane (HTMD). The oxidation of DNA led to 8-oxodGuo and the type I photooxidation product 2,2-diamino[2-deoxy-\xce\xb2-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-4-amino]-5(2H)-oxazolone (oxazolone). While the yield of oxazolone progressively increased, 8-oxodGuo was substantially consumed in DNA on successive exposure to HTMD. The oxidation of authentic 8-oxodGuo by HTMD and established photosensitizers such as benzophenone (mainly type I) and Rose Bengal (predominantly type II) was studied in detail in regard to the concentration and time dependence and the influence of D2O versus H2O. The singlet-oxygen-derived 4R* and 4S* diastereomers of 4-hydroxy-8-oxo-4,8-dihydro-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine (4-HO-8-oxodGuo) and oxazolone were the major products. A substantial kinetic D2O effect (ca. 10-fold) in the Rose Bengal-photosensitized degradation of 8-oxodGuo unequivocally established that in this case singlet oxygen (type II photooxidation) is involved. However, the efficient formation of oxazolone by benzophenone as a characteristic type I photooxidant, as well as in the HTMD-mediated oxidation (predominantly type I), and the fact that these processes exhibit a negligible D2O effect provide cogent experimental evidence for an electron or hydrogen atom transfer mechanism (type I photooxidation) in the oxidative degradation of 8-oxodGuo into oxazolone. The unprecedented observation that comparable product ratios of 4-HO-8-oxodGuo and oxazolone were obtained in the 8-oxodGuo oxidations, irrespective of whether Rose Bengal as a typical type II photooxidant or benzophenone as an established type I photooxidant was employed, is presumably due to electron-transfer chemistry of 1O2 with the easily oxidized 8-oxodGuo in view of its low oxidation potential. This nicely accounts for the fact that the primary oxidation product 8-oxodGuo, which serves as important monitor of oxidative genotoxicity, may not accumulate appreciably in the photooxidation of DNA.

"Because there are no general reaction conditions for any glycosylation method, biologically interesting oligosaccharides can only be made in a small number of laboratories in the world. To make carbohydrate synthesis accessible to nonspecialists, it is critical to have glycosylation methods that will work in a wide range of cases under a single set of conditions. The Lewis blood group antigens have attracted the attention of numerous synthetic carbohydrate groups because of their structural complexity. Although they have been synthesized many times, they have never been made using a single glycosylation method under one set of reaction conditions. In this paper, we show that the sulfoxide glycosylation method can be used to form all of the glycosidic linkages in the Lewis blood group antigens Lea (1), Leb (2), and Lex (3) stereoselectively under a uniform set of reaction conditions. This work highlights the flexibility of the sulfoxide method and demonstrates its utility for constructing families of related oligosaccharides. "
"The structure and stereochemistry of the tricyclic sesquiterpene alcohol (\xe2\x88\x92)-presilphiperfolanol, a structural precursor for the angular and propellane triquinane sesquiterpenes, are established as (1S,4S,7S,8S,11S)-2,2,4,8-tetramethyltricyclo[5.3.1.04,11]undecan-11-ol [[2aS-(2a\xce\xb1,4a\xce\xb2,5\xce\xb2,7a\xce\xb2,7b\xce\xb2)]-decahydro-1,1,2a,5-tetramethyl-7bH-cyclopenta[cd]inden-7b-ol, 1] by an X-ray crystallographic analysis of its p-nitrobenzoate derivative 8a and by correlation with (\xe2\x88\x92)-silphiperfol-6-ene (6). Dehydration of 1 afforded a 2:1 mixture of presilphiperfol-1(8)- and 7-enes (9 + 10) which underwent epoxidation on both \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 faces. Acid-catalyzed dehydration with H2SO4\xe2\x88\x92silica gel lead to competing ring contractions by migrations of C11 and C9 to C8 to give silphiperfolene (6) and \xce\xb1-terrecyclene (12) in a 98:1 ratio. Solvolysis of 8a in 60% aqueous acetone provided a mixture of olefins (9 + 10 + 6) and 1 (9%) as the sole alcohol product. The similarity of the solvolysis rate (5.2 \xc3\x97 10-5 s-1 at 50 \xc2\xb0C) to the literature value for trans-bicyclo[3.3.0]octan-1-yl p-nitrobenzoate indicates comparable levels of strain relief in the respective transition states.

"NMR relaxation analysis was used to characterize the internal dynamics of oxidized E. coli thioredoxin in both the picosecond-nanosecond and microsecond-millisecond frequency ranges for 413 H\xe2\x88\x92C and H\xe2\x88\x92N bond vectors. The 13C relaxation data was obtained utilizing protein samples possessing an alternating 13C\xe2\x88\x9212C\xe2\x88\x9213C... labeling pattern for most enriched sites. When combined with partial deuteration, this labeling pattern provides for isolated 1H\xe2\x88\x9213C IS spin pairs exhibiting dynamically interpretable relaxation behavior. Side chains were found to exhibit a far broader range of dynamics than have been previously characterized for main chain resonances. The dynamics of structurally buried aromatic and leucine side chains are interpreted in terms of correlated main chain-side chain torsional oscillations. Structural regions exhibiting millisecond dynamics were found to correlate strongly with the presence of side chain-main chain or bifurcated main chain hydrogen bonds. Nuclei around the active site disulfide that exhibit mobility in the millisecond range correspond closely to the set of nuclei whose chemical shifts are altered upon reduction. The transient conformation is interpreted in terms of enhanced reactivity due to strain at the disulfide linkage. "

"The effect of the peptide bond on protein fluorescence is an important unresolved question in tryptophan photophysics. Definitive evidence for the peptide group as a weak quencher of indole fluorescence was obtained from solute quenching studies with a series of model compounds. Two amides are required for detectable quenching of 3-methylindole fluorescence and the quenching rate depends on the distance between amides. The bimolecular rate constants kq of malonamide, N-acetylasparagine, N-acetylglycinamide, and N-acetylglutamine are 33 \xc3\x97 107, 8.8 \xc3\x97 107, 6.6 \xc3\x97 107, and 2.2 \xc3\x97 107 M-1 s-1, respectively. Transient absorption and temperature dependence of the fluorescence lifetime measured in the absence and presence of quencher gave strong circumstantial evidence for electron transfer as the quenching mechanism. Triplet yields were measured for five indole derivatives using transient absorption. Intersystem crossing rates were calculated from triplet yield and fluorescence lifetime data. The intersystem crossing rate kisc varies from 2.1 \xc3\x97 107 s-1 for 3-methylindole to 7.6 \xc3\x97 107 s-1 for indole. The peptide group does not change the value of kisc of 3-methylindole. The sum of the radiative and intersystem crossing rates is equal to the temperature-independent portion of the fluorescence decay rate for 3-methylindole, indole, N-acetyltryptophanamide, and N-methylindole, confirming that intersystem crossing in indoles is independent of temperature in aqueous solution. The temperature dependence of the fluorescence lifetime of 3-methylindole was determined in the presence of N-acetylglycinamide, ethyl acetate, and GdCl3. Two separate Arrhenius terms were resolved for water quenching and solute quenching. The activation energies for solute quenching by N-acetylglycinamide, ethyl acetate, and GdCl3 are 2.5 \xc2\xb1 0.3, 0.0, and 6.0 \xc2\xb1 0.5 kcal/mol, respectively. For intramolecular quenching by the peptide bonds in N-acetyltryptophanamide, the activation energy is 3.2 \xc2\xb1 0.3 kcal/mol. The strategy of using the temperature dependence of the fluorescence lifetime to calculate the rates of individual nonradiative processes is discussed. "
"Intramolecular alkoxycarbonylation of tungsten\xe2\x88\x92propargyl compounds proceeds with excellent diastereoselectivities to form \xce\xb73-\xce\xb4- and -\xce\xb5-lactones but for \xce\xb3-lactones. With OSi(t-Bu)Me2 substituted for an \xce\xb1-hydroxy group, \xce\xb73-\xce\xb3-lactones are stereoselectively formed with syn stereoselection. An optically active tungsten \xce\xb73-\xce\xb3-lactone is prepared from d-(+)-xylose to illustrate the stereochemical effect of OSi(t-Bu)Me2. All these \xce\xb73-\xce\xb3-, -\xce\xb4-, and -\xce\xb5-lactones are converted to allyl anions that react in situ with aldehydes and ketones to produce various \xce\xb2-(hydroxylalkyl)-\xce\xb1-methylene-\xce\xb3-lactones with good diastereoselectivity. This reaction is also applied to the synthesis of chiral \xce\xb1-methylene butyrolactones. Organic carbonyls add to the \xcf\x80-allyl groups of \xce\xb73-\xce\xb3- and -\xce\xb4-lactones opposite the tungsten fragment, whereas additions occur from the metal side for \xce\xb73-\xce\xb5-lactones.

"Reactions of the pyrazolylborates KTp\xe2\x80\x98 with Zn(ClO4)2 and KOH in a 2:2:1 ratio yield the complexes [Tp\xe2\x80\x982Zn2O2H3]ClO4 (1) for Tp\xe2\x80\x98 = hydrotris(3-R-5-methylpyrazolyl)borate with R = p-isopropylphenyl (a), 3-pyridyl (b), and 3-(6-methyl)pyridyl (c). Their structure determinations have revealed a Zn-OH-H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7OH-Zn array (i.e., a bridging H3O2- ligand) in the dinuclear complex cations. The zinc ions in complex 1a are in a distorted tetrahedral ZnN3O environment, and those in 1b and 1c are in a distorted trigonal bipyramidal ZnN4O environment due to additional coordination of one pyridyl nitrogen from the opposing Tp\xe2\x80\x98 ligand. In 1b, one Zn-OH function is involved in a hydrogen bridge to a cocrystallized methanol molecule. The complexes represent a mode of stabilization for the zinc\xe2\x88\x92aqua function in the cationic Tp\xe2\x80\x98Zn-OH2 species, and they are intermediates in the formation of the stable Tp\xe2\x80\x98Zn-OH complexes.

"Dinuclear platinum complexes form a unique array of DNA adducts including (Pt,Pt) interstrand and (Pt,Pt) intrastrand cross-links. A (Pt,Pt) intrastrand adduct between two adjacent guanines is the structural analog of the major adduct formed by cis-DDP. In this study, we examined the kinetics of formation and structure of the (Pt,Pt) intrastrand adduct by following the interaction of [{trans-PtCl(NH3)2}2{\xce\xbc-H2N(CH2)nNH2}]2+ (1,1/t,t, n = 2\xe2\x88\x926) with d(GpG) using NMR spectroscopy and by molecular modeling. Initial coordination, to either the 5\xe2\x80\x98-G or the 3\xe2\x80\x98-G, is relatively fast compared to the second binding step, ring closure to the macrochelate adduct (i.e., [1,1/t,t]\xe2\x88\x92d(GpG)\xe2\x88\x92N7(1),N7(2)). The rate of ring closure depends on the chain length of the diamine linker. Complexes linked by a longer diamine chain (n = 4\xe2\x88\x926) react faster and produce a higher yield of macrochelate compared to the shorter n = 2, 3 diamine linkers. The structure of the (Pt,Pt) intrastrand adduct is significantly different from the cis-DDP\xe2\x88\x92d(GpG) chelate. The major difference is the presence of a syn-orientated G base (observed for 1,1/t,t\xe2\x88\x92(GpG) macrochelates of n = 3 and n = 6). For the macrochelate of [1,1/t,t, n = 3], i.e., [{trans-PtCl(NH3)2}2{\xce\xbc-H2N(CH2)3NH2}]{d(GpG)\xe2\x88\x92N7(1),N7(2)}, the sugar conformation of the 5\xe2\x80\x98-G(G1) is 28% S, whereas for 3\xe2\x80\x98-G(G2) this value is much higher (69% S). In the corresponding n = 6 macrochelate these values are 55% S and 30% S for G(1) and G(2), respectively. The orientation of the two G bases in the [1,1/t,t]\xe2\x88\x92d(GpG) chelates is best described as tectonic or \xe2\x80\x9cstepped head-to-head\xe2\x80\x9d. The structure helps explain the flexible bending in DNA induced by the dinuclear platinum complexes in contrast to the rigid directed bend into the major groove caused by cis-DDP. "
"The initial crystallization phase of native and dimethylated \xce\xb2-cyclodextrins (\xce\xb2-CD) was investigated with small-angle static light scattering. Following simple considerations, one can obtain the crystallization exponent, predicted by the Avrami theory, from temperature quenching experiments. We found that a single-step mechanism, in accordance with the classical theory, holds for the crystal formation of native \xce\xb2-cyclodextrin. The crystal formation mechanism of the heptakis(2,6)-di-O-methyl)-\xce\xb2-CD is more complex, and involves a fast and a slow process. The exponents determined for each process indicate that crystallization starts with the formation of spherical clusters which aggregate further to form rod-shaped macrocrystals, in accordance with microscopic observations. In either case the determined exponents depend on the initial cyclodextrin concentration. "
"A new method, providing a significant improvement in sensitivity, is presented for obtaining selective two-dimensional NMR correlation (COSY) spectra. The method is demonstrated on a small molecule having nonlinear optical properties and is further demonstrated by the precise determination of scalar coupling constants in the peptide gramicidin and in a 57 amino acid fragment of the nucleocapsid of the hepatitis C virus. In these systems we observe sensitivity improvements of between a factor of 2 and 6. In the case of the protein it was not practical to record the selective COSY spectra using conventional techniques. The method makes use of the recently introduced concept of \xe2\x80\x9clinear\xe2\x80\x9d selective pulses which provide a simple way of obtaining pure-phase band selective excitation with an arbitrary shape for the response. In a selective 2D COSY experiment the relative sensitivity improvement provided by these pulses is cubed with respect to a 1D experiment. The resulting pulse sequences are highly unusual in that they require a modulation of the pulse shape and pulse length as the indirect detection period is increased. "
"We describe a new approach for observation of multiple-quantum (MQ) NMR spectra of S = 3/2 nuclei with magic-angle spinning (MAS). The new method employs the Rotation-Induced Adiabatic Coherence Transfer (RIACT) that occurs between triple-quantum (3Q) and central-transition (1Q) coherences in S = 3/2 systems. In contrast to currently available coherence-transfer techniques, RIACT is relatively insensitive to the magnitude of the quadrupole interaction for e2qQ/h \xe2\x89\xa4 4 MHz for both 3Q excitation and 3Q-to-1Q conversion. Thus, RIACT provides a means of extracting quantitative information about site populations from isotropic MQ NMR spectra. We illustrate the utility of the approach with 23Na (S = 3/2) MQ NMR spectra of a series of sodium salts exhibiting crystallographically distinct sites. The spectra provide quantitative measurements of quadrupolar parameters, chemical shifts, and relative site populations for each of the crystallographically distinct sodium sites. "
"We present the results of new and previously published 17O NMR, EPR, and NMRD studies of aqueous solutions of the Gd3+ octaaqua ion and the commercial MRI contrast agents [Gd(DTPA)(H2O)]2- (MAGNEVIST, Schering AG, DTPA = 1,1,4,7,7-pentakis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7-triazaheptane), [Gd(DTPA-BMA)(H2O)] (OMNISCAN, Sanofi Nycomed, DTPA-BMA = 1,7-bis[(N-methylcarbamoyl)methyl]-1,4,7-tris(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7-triazaheptane), and [Gd(DOTA)(H2O)]- (DOTAREM, Guerbet, DOTA = 1,4,7,10-tetrakis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane). High-field EPR measurements at different concentrations give evidence of an intermolecular dipole\xe2\x88\x92dipole electronic relaxation mechanism that has not previously been described for Gd3+ complexes. For the first time, the experimental data from the three techniques for each complex have been treated using a self-consistent theoretical model in a simultaneous multiple parameter least-squares fitting procedure. The lower quality of the fits compared to separate fits of the data for each of the three techniques shows that the increase in the number of adjustable parameters is outweighed by the increased constraint on the fits. The parameters governing the relaxivity of the complexes are thus determined with greater confidence than previously possible. The same approach was used to study two dimeric Gd3+ complexes [pip{Gd(DO3A)(H2O)}2] and [bisoxa{Gd(DO3A)(H2O)}2] (pip(DO3A)2 = bis(1,4-(1-(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraaza-4,7,10-tris(carboxymethyl)-1-cyclododecyl-1,4-diazacyclohexane, bisoxa(DO3A)2 = bis(1,4-(1-(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraaza-4,7,10-tris(carboxymethyl)-1-cyclododecyl))-1,10-diaza-3,6-dioxadecane) that are being developed as potential second-generation MRI contrast agents. These dimeric complexes are expected to have higher relaxivities than the monomeric contrast agents, due to their longer rotational correlation times. The results of this study show that further relaxivity gain for these complexes will be hindered by the slow rate of water exchange on the complexes. High-field EPR measurements suggest that there is a previously unrecorded intramolecular dipole\xe2\x88\x92dipole mechanism of electronic relaxation, but that this additional contribution to electronic relaxation is of minor importance compared to the limiting effect of water exchange rates in the determination of proton relaxivity in MRI applications.

"2,4-Dimethoxy-1,3,5-benzenetriyltris(N-tert-butyl nitroxide) (3) was prepared by lithiation of 2,4-dimethoxy-1,3,5-tribromobenzene followed by the reaction with 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane and subsequent oxidation with Ag2O. The triradical crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnma (no. 62) with four molecules in the unit cell of dimensions a = 18.200(3) \xc3\x85, b = 19.018(3) \xc3\x85, and c = 6.659(5) \xc3\x85. X-ray analysis for an orange plate single crystal of 3 revealed that the three nitroxide radicals in a molecule have large dihedral angles (90\xc2\xb0 and 79\xc2\xb0) between N\xe2\x88\x92O bonds and the benzene ring plane in the all-syn conformation and the distances between them are 5.44 and 5.28 \xc3\x85. An EPR spectrum of triradical 3 in frozen toluene solution showed quartet signals (g = 2.0062, |D/hc| = 0.010, and |E/hc| = 0.0004 cm-1) in addition to the signals at g = 4.019 and 6.035 due to \xce\x94ms = 2 and 3 transitions, respectively. Temperature dependence of molar susceptibility for a microcrystalline sample obtained by SQUID measurements suggested that the antiferromagnetic interaction produces a doublet ground state in triradical 3. Experimental data were fitted in terms of the equation derived from an isosceles triangular three spin system (H = \xe2\x88\x922J(SA1SB + SBSA2 + \xce\xb1SA1SA2)) with negative J\'s to afford two sets of the best fitting parameters:\xe2\x80\x89 J/kB = \xe2\x88\x9241.5 K, \xce\xb1 = 0.31 and J/kB = \xe2\x88\x9222.3 K, \xce\xb1 = 2.29. The former J/kB value is more consistent with J/kB = \xe2\x88\x9239.7 K for the reference biradical, 1-bromo-2,4-dimethoxy-3,5-benzenediylbis(N-tert-butyl nitroxide) (4). In triradical 3, therefore, the ground spin state would be a doublet with the stronger antiferromagnetic interaction between the spins at 1 and 3 positions and 3 and 5 positions polarizing the ferromagnetic alignment of the 1 and 5 spins, providing the first demonstration of an organic triradical showing competing interactions.

In addition to the previously recognized 3\xe2\x80\x98- and 5\xe2\x80\x98-terminal (w and a) ions, internal ions (i) and MS/MS/MS of fragment ions provide unique structural information across the DNA. NS dissociation can also yield other new backbone cleavages (forming b, c, d, and r ions) that provide extensive 5\xe2\x80\x98-end information. These spectra indicate that loss of the base T rarely triggers formation of w, a, or i fragment ions, a correlation of further sequencing utility. Point mutation screening is demonstrated using a modified 50-mer unknown; a 9.04 (theory 9.01) decrease in the molecular weight (Mr) value indicates A \xe2\x86\x92 T, while three IRMPD fragment ions pinpoint this mutation at base 27. Introduction (measurement time <1 min) of 8 \xc3\x97 10-16 mol of the 50-mer gave an Mr value with only a 0.2 error. "
"High-Pressure Mass Spectrometric (HPMS) experiments have been carried out to probe the details of the double minimum potential energy surface for gas-phase SN2 reactions. The well depths and entropy changes associated with the formation of entrance and exit channel electrostatic complexes for the chloride and bromide adducts of methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, and tert-butyl chlorides and bromides have been determined from the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constants for adduct formation. In the cases of \xe2\x80\x9csymmetric\xe2\x80\x9d complexes associated with identity SN2 reactions, there is an increase in well depth as the size and, therefore, polarizability of the alkyl group increases. Concomitant with this is an increase in the magnitude of the negative entropy change for complex formation which is the result of an increase in the frequency of the intermolecular mode(s) of the complex arising from the increased bond strength. The data for the unsymmetrical adducts for the non-identity SN2 reactions show the same pattern of increasing well depth with increasing alkyl group size with the chloride adducts of alkyl bromides being more strongly bound than the bromide adducts of the corresponding alkyl chlorides. Enthalpies and entropies associated with transition state formation are determined from the temperature dependence of the rate constant for the net halide displacement reaction. These data show that the transition state for the reaction of chloride ion with alkyl bromides may lie below (CH3Br), near (C2H5Br), or above (i-C3H7Br, t-C4H9Br) the energy of separated reactants. These three situations exhibit different changes in rate constant with increasing temperature. In addition, the lifetime of the transient, chemically activated intermediate formed between chloride ion and methyl chloride has been determined from the pressure dependence of the rate constant for formation of the observable, collisionally stabilized electrostatic adduct. The lifetime thus obtained is in excellent agreement with trajectory calculations performed by Hase and co-workers. "
"In connection with the major unimolecular decompositions of ionized propane, namely, methane elimination and methyl radical loss, ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the UMP2/6-31G(d) (molecular geometries) and QCISD(T)/6-311+G(2d,2p) (energies) levels of theory have been used to investigate the relevant parts of the C3H8\xe2\x80\xa2+ ground-state potential energy surface (PES). The calculations demonstrate that at internal energies about 15 kJ/mol below the thermochemical threshold for methyl radical loss, partial bond dissociation to an ion\xe2\x88\x92neutral complex consisting of the methyl radical coordinated to the H-bridged ethyl cation and methane elimination therefrom both occur. The contours of the C3H8\xe2\x80\xa2+ ground-state PES are such that at the threshold for methane elimination the methyl radical partner of the complex is directed to the hydrogen atom it will abstract without being able to move freely around the ethyl cation partner. A higher energy configuration of the ion\xe2\x88\x92neutral complex, lying about 11 kJ/mol below the threshold for simple dissociation, mediates the carbon skeletal rearrangement of the propane radical cation. The observed predominance of the methane losses involving terminal carbon atoms over those involving the central carbon atom are rationalized on the basis that such a degenerate rearrangement precedes the methane elimination.

"The visible absorption band of iodine adsorbed on zeolite blue-shifted with increasing the electropositivity of the countercation and the aluminum content in the framework. This phenomenon was attributed to the increase in the donor strength of the zeolite framework based on the analogous spectral shift of iodine in solution. In support of this, a negative linear correlation was observed between the measured visible bands of iodine adsorbed on various zeolites and their calculated Sanderson\'s intermediate electronegativities. However, the simultaneous change in the electrostatic field strength within the zeolite pores, as a result of the change in the number and the size of the cation, has to be taken into account in order to interpret the overall spectral shifts more precisely. The iodine band sensitively blue-shifted with decreasing the moisture content in the framework but red-shifted with the loss of NH3 from NH4+-exchanged zeolites. The visible band of iodine also progressively red-shifted with increasing the adsorbed amount, presumably due to the nature of iodine to deplete electron density from the framework. The framework structure also affected the spectral shift of the visible iodine band. The overall results established that iodine can be used as a novel molecular probe for the quantitative evaluation of the zeolite donor strength. "
"ESR spectroscopy has been used to identify the paramagnetic species trapped at 77 K upon \xce\xb3-irradiation of glassy water prepared by hyperquenching of liquid water at cooling rates exceeding 105 K/s. Besides OH radicals, which are the only paramagnetic intermediates of water radiolysis stabilized at 77 K in hexagonal ice prepared by slow cooling of liquid water, comparable amounts of HO2 radicals were found in glassy water. The ESR spectra for trapped OH radicals were typical of such radicals in a glass. Neither trapped electrons nor trapped hydrogen atoms were detected. The contributions of OH and HO2 radicals to the ESR spectra of glassy water do not depend on irradiation dose in the range 0.8\xe2\x88\x9218 kGy. We stress that HO2 radicals are not detected in irradiated hexagonal ice under these conditions. They are formed as secondary products after annealing to destroy the OH radicals, but the yields are tiny relative to the remarkably high yields observed in the glassy water. Possible mechanisms for HO2 radical formation in the early stages of water radiolysis in the glassy state are discussed. "
"C70 (like other fullerenes) is known to have a very weak fluorescence (\xce\xa6F \xe2\x89\x85 5 \xc3\x97 10-4), owing to the high efficiency of triplet formation. In this work we show that, under appropriate conditions, the fluorescence quantum yield increases by one or two orders of magnitude (up to an estimated maximum value \xce\xa6F = 0.08), through the mechanism of delayed thermal fluorescence. We also report a new estimate of the singlet\xe2\x88\x92triplet gap (26 \xc2\xb1 2 kJ mol-1), obtained from the temperature dependence of the delayed thermal fluorescence. This value is shown to be in agreement with the phosphorescence spectrum recorded in the same temperature range. An accurate value of the quantum yield of triplet formation (0.994 \xc2\xb1 0.001) is obtained from a new method of data analysis. "
"High-level ab initio calculations have been used to determine the minimum energy structures of N,N\xe2\x80\x98-diformylhydrazine, N-methyl-N,N\xe2\x80\x98-diformylhydrazine, and N,N\xe2\x80\x98-dimethyl-N,N\xe2\x80\x98-diformylhydrazine. These calculations show that the global minimum is a nonplanar structure in which the nitrogen lone pairs are essentially perpendicular to one another. However, the energy required for (Z,Z)-diformylhydrazine to adopt a planar structure is less than 1 kcal/mol (MP2/6-31+G**). This is due to attractive intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the N-hydrogens and the carbonyl oxygens in the planar geometry. When one or both amide configurations are inverted (Z,E; E,E), or when the nitrogens are substituted, with methyl for example, these hydrogen bonds are lost and the planar structure becomes much less stable relative to the twisted rotamer. Thus, we conclude from these calculations that diacylhydrazines are intrinsically nonplanar with respect to the CO\xe2\x88\x92N\xe2\x88\x92N\xe2\x88\x92CO torsion, and that with the exception of (Z,Z)-diformylhydrazine the rotational barriers are large. The observation of a planar crystal structure for diformylhydrazine is due to additional intermolecular hydrogen bonds which are available to planar diformylhydrazine in the crystal lattice. Finally, these calculations have significant implications for the structure and dynamical properties of nonsteroidal ecdysone agonists, azapeptides, and azatides which incorporate the diacylhydrazine structure.

"Ab initio molecular orbital theory was used to investigate the structure of flavin in different oxidation and protonation states using lumiflavin as a model compound. According to our study, oxidized flavin is planar no matter what its protonation state or whether it participates in hydrogen bonding. The structures of flavin semiquinone radicals are planar or very close to planar, but the reduced flavin H3Flred (9) is bent with a ring puckering angle of 27.3\xc2\xb0 along the N5 and N10 axis. The calculations indicate that N1 is the site of protonation for oxidized flavin, which is in agreement with several crystallographic studies. The calculated spin density distribution for flavin semiquinone radicals is also consistent with experimental results. Electrostatic potential derived charges at the RHF/6-31G* level of theory are also provided for both oxidized and reduced flavins. "
"The assembly of amphiphilic phenylacetylene macrocycles (PAMs), with molecular structures that vary in terms of the nature and orientation of their pendant functional groups, has been studied on a Langmuir\xe2\x88\x92Blodgett trough and after transfer onto solid substrates. These monolayer films are of interest as two-dimensional host matrices and shape selective membranes whose two-dimensional organization should bring together shape selective compartments. The disk-like PAMs can, in principle, adopt orientations in which the plane of the macrocycle can range from perpendicular (edge-on) to parallel (face-on) at the interface. PAMs functionalized with six hydrophilic groups around the periphery do not prefer the face-on orientation and are most likely tilted, perhaps in a poorly organized state. PAMs that have spatially segregated hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups adopt the edge-on orientation when the hydrophilic moieties are carboxylate groups. In contrast, PAMs appended with acid moieties do not lead to stable monolayers, most likely because they engage in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions as evidenced by 1H NMR and vapor pressure osmometry of the solutions. Monolayers of the dicarboxylate PAMs were transferred onto fused silica and Si(100) surfaces and these were in turn characterized by contact angle, ellipsometry, absorption FTIR, and angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Taken together these characterization experiments strongly support the hypothesis that the dicarboxylate PAMs form a well-ordered and stable two-dimensional array and that they adopt the edge-on configuration with near-vertical orientation of the macrocycle plane.

"The nucleophilic substitution reactions of three trisulfides by thiolate were evaluated at MP2(full)/6-31+G* and MP4SDTQ(fc)/6-311+G**//MP2(full)/6-31+G*. The results show that the gas-phase mechanism at MP2/6-31+G* is addition\xe2\x88\x92elimination. Kinetically, there is a 2\xe2\x88\x925 kcal mol-1 preference for attack at a terminal sulfur over a central sulfur in the same trisulfide. This preference for the terminal sulfur is due to more steric hindrance encountered when the nucleophile attacks the central sulfur versus attacking a terminal sulfur. Hydrogen bonding between the nucleophile and the trisulfide also assists in directing attack to the terminal position. Attack at the terminal sulfur is also thermodynamically favored, a result of the thiosulfenate being a better leaving group than the thiolate. These results provide theoretical support to the findings of Myers et al. that the trigger mechanism for activation of calichaemicin and related enediyne antitumor agents occurs by a multistep process, with a displacement at the terminal sulfur of the trisulfide followed by nucleophilic substitution of a disulfide. "
"Hydrolytic removal of the 2\xe2\x80\x98-tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) group from a 2\xe2\x80\x98-O-TBDMS protected UpU dimer [U(2\xe2\x80\x98-Si)pU] (1) (Si = TBDMS) and related derivatives under various acidic conditions was studied in detail. First, desilylation of 1 by use of acetic acid was examined. Consequently, we made the unprecedented discovery that cleavage of the 2\xe2\x80\x98-silyl ether linkage occurred fastest at a very low concentration of acetic acid within the range of 5\xe2\x88\x9210%, depending on the temperature. Formic acid could cleave the silyl ether much faster than acetic acid, but the relationship between the reaction rate and the concentration of acid was different from that of acetic acid. The use of 20\xe2\x88\x9240% formic acid resulted in very effective elimination of the 2\xe2\x80\x98-TBDMS group. Moreover, diluted HCl solution (pH 2.0) could cleave the Si\xe2\x88\x92O bond faster than acetic acid at 30 \xc2\xb0C. In contrast, the 2\xe2\x80\x98-silyl group of the corresponding methylphosphonate derivative [U(2\xe2\x80\x98-Si)p(Me)U] (3) was much more stable than that of 1. In the case of a diastereomeric mixture of the phosphorothioate dimer [U(2\xe2\x80\x98-Si)psU] (2), a big difference in reaction rate between the Rp- and Sp-diastereomers was observed. These results strongly suggest that neighboring group participation of the 3\xe2\x80\x98-5\xe2\x80\x98 phosphorodiester group is involved in the present acid-catalyzed 2\xe2\x80\x98-desilylation. These conditions were successfully applied to the deprotection of the 2\xe2\x80\x98-TBDMS group of an RNA intermediate which was chemically synthesized by the conventional phosphoramidite approach on a CPG gel.

"Conjugates of oligonucleotides with chlorin-type photosensitizers were prepared. Two chlorin moieties, CPP and CHEVP, characterized by a modified pyrrole unit bearing an aldehyde chain, were photochemically prepared from protoporphyrin and heptaethylvinylporphyrin, respectively. These chlorin moieties were coupled through the carboxylic acid side-chain (CPP) or aldehyde side-chain (CHEVP) to the 3\xe2\x80\x98-activated phosphate of oligodeoxynucleotides. Diamine or dihydrazide were used as linkers. The resulting conjugates were purified by HPLC and characterized by electrophoresis, UV\xe2\x88\x92visible spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The photosensitizing properties of the conjugate of CHEVP with the 14-mer oligodeoxynucleotide TTCTTCTCCTTTCT were investigated using three different targets. A single-stranded 25-mer containing the complementary sequence of the 14-mer formed a double helix with the chlorin-14-mer conjugate. A 24 base-pair duplex and a 41-mer hairpin with 18 base pairs and a five nucleotide loop formed triple helices with the conjugate. In all cases, upon irradiation with visible light (428 or 668 nm), piperidine-labile sites at guanine positions were produced. The reaction required oxygen and was inhibited to some extent by sodium azide. The cleavage sites were correlated with the chlorin position in both the duplex and triplex structures. In the 41-mer hairpin, the most reactive guanines were those located in the loop region. The quantum yield for cleavage of the hairpin structure was determined to be about 10-3, independent of the excitation wavelength. This modest value is largely compensated by the high absorption of the chlorin in the red, making the conjugate highly efficient even under low light fluence. No effect was found with a noncomplementary chlorin-oligonucleotide conjugate. These results show that site-directed damages to nucleic acid structures can be achieved using oligonucleotide-chlorin conjugates and red light irradiation. "
"The helix is a common secondary structural element in proteins. Several subtypes of helical structures are possible, depending on the nature of the backbone hydrogen-bonding pattern. For short peptides in solution, more than one helical conformation may be in equilibrium. Most of the time it is extremely difficult to identify experimentally the interconversion between different helix forms in solution, although one of the helical structures may be trapped in single crystals. This report analyzes crystallographic and NMR studies of a model heptapeptide, Boc-Leu-Aib-Val-Ala-Leu-Aib-Val-OMe, designed to probe conformational heterogeneity and relative stability of different helical structures. In crystals the peptide adopts a right-handed 310-helical structure, terminated by a left-handed helical conformation (\xce\xb1L) at Aib(6) resulting in a 6\xe2\x86\x921 hydrogen bond at the C-terminus. The crystals are in space group P21, a = 9.843(4) \xc3\x85, b = 19.944(4) \xc3\x85, c = 12.456(2) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 102.51(2)\xc2\xb0, Z = 2, R = 10.1%, and Rw = 9.21% for 2301 reflections; |F| > 3\xcf\x83(F). In CDCl3 NMR studies establish that the NH groups of residues 3\xe2\x88\x926 are hydrogen bonded, consistent with a continuous 310-helix or the conformation observed in crystals. In (CD3)2SO, NMR studies reveal that the NH groups of residues 1\xe2\x88\x923 are solvent exposed, supporting an \xce\xb1-helical structure. However, NMR data suggest appreciable conformational heterogeneity in solution, with population of extended states and conformations resembling the structure in crystals. Helical conformations terminated by \xce\xb1L residues may be an important subset of helical structure in peptides, particularly when the penultimate residue is achiral or has a propensity to adopt \xce\xb1L conformations.

"Snarf-1-AM (Seminaphthorhodafluor-1-acetoxymethylester) being used as a fluorescent pH probe, confocal laser microspectrofluorometric measurements allowed intracellular pH to be assessed within 3T3 mouse fibroblasts in the presence or in the absence of hypericin. Cytoplasmic local pH drops of 0.4 unit have been measured in the presence of 1 \xce\xbcM hypericin after 90 s of exposure to 0.1 \xce\xbcW of illumination at 514 nm. Moreover, time course experiments clearly show that this local pH decrease is actually light dose dependent. Taking into account previously reported results and interpretations, it is shown here that this pH decrease has to be considered as one of the possible processes responsible for the photosensitizing properties of hypericin, involved in its virucidal and antitumor activities.

"[6](9,10)Anthracenophane (1a) was synthesized by the benzoannelation method starting from dibromo[6]paracyclophane 6 via diepoxyanthracenophanes 3a and 4a. In a similar fashion, peri-substituted derivatives, tetramethyl (1b) and tetraphenyl (1c), were synthesized through the corresponding diepoxyanthracenes 3b, 4b, and 3c. Molecular structures of tetramethyldiepoxyanthracenophanes 3b and 5b are discussed with regard to the Mills\xe2\x88\x92Nixon effect on the basis of their X-ray structure analyses. The parent anthracenophane 1a is extremely air- and acid-sensitive, so it is characterized spectroscopically as a mixture containing its dihydro derivative 8a. The peri-substituted derivatives 1b and 1c are more stable than 1a, and are fully characterized by spectroscopic methods and X-ray crystallographic analyses. X-ray structures reveal that the out-of-plane deformation angles of the bridged aromatic ring of 1b and 1c are the largest observed in any short-bridged [n]cyclophanes. Semiempirical AM1 calculations indicate that the out-of-plane deformation of the aromatic rings 1b and 1c is more severe than that of 1a due to the steric repulsion between the benzylic methylenes and the peri substituents. That the kinetic stability observed for 1b and 1c was greater than that of 1a is, therefore, ascribable to the steric protection of the reactive bridgehead carbons by the peri substituents. Acid-catalyzed rearrangement of 1a\xe2\x88\x92c gave the corresponding methylenedihydro isomers 2a\xe2\x88\x92c, which represent the first examples of bridged methylenedihydroanthracenes. Photochemical isomerization of 1b and 1c took place readily, giving the corresponding Dewar anthracenes 11b and 11c. Thermal cycloreversion of 11b and 11c gave the cyclophanes 1b and 1c with Ea values of 22.3 and 25.4 kcal/mol, respectively. "
"The neat phase properties of the \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 anomers of 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-(trans-3,4-dialkoxycinnamoyl)-(d)-glucopyranose (n\xce\xb1GP and n\xce\xb2GP; n, the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chains, is 6\xe2\x88\x928, 10, and 14) have been investigated by optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray powder diffraction. Each of the GP forms an enantiotropic and thermotropic discotic columnar liquid\xe2\x88\x92crystalline phase. Irradiation of the 14GP in dilute solutions leads to two intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions between cinnamoyl double bonds. In the solid I (obtained by recrystallization from solvent and in which 14GP molecules are paired in each columnar stack) and \xe2\x80\x9cisotropic\xe2\x80\x9d melt phases, only short (<10 monomer unit), probably branched oligomers form upon irradiation due to the continued preference for intramolecular cycloadditions and the ability of each monomer to interact with more than two neighbors. Irradiation of the solid II phase (obtained by cooling the liquid\xe2\x88\x92crystalline phase) provides unbranched oligomers with <20 monomer units. However, more than 30 14\xce\xb1GP monomer units have been linked in unbranched chains upon irradiation of its liquid\xe2\x88\x92crystalline phase. This is the greatest degree of columnar polymerization reported to date from a discotic mesophase. Qualitatively similar results are obtained upon irradiation of other GP in their various phases. Oligomerization of GP liquid\xe2\x88\x92crystalline and solid I phases is intracolumnar, and the columnar packing arrangement of the monomers is retained to ca. 100 \xc2\xb0C above their clearing temperatures; each GP produces nanoscale cylinders of one diameter but varying lengths. The oligomers unwind and do not retake their original form when they are dissolved and reprecipitated or heated to above their clearing temperatures and cooled. The nature of the oligomerization processes is discussed, especially with regard to inter-/intramolecular and inter-/intracolumnar competitions for [2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions and the possibility of an anomeric effect on oligomer length.

"The title compound has been synthesized as its racemate in 33 steps. An intramolecular Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reaction (see Scheme 5, 24 \xe2\x86\x92 25) was used to provide control over the eventual cis C4\xe2\x88\x92C7 relationship. The installation of another cis related ethynyl group at C2 arose from transformation 40 \xe2\x86\x92 42 (see Scheme 8) whose directionality is governed by a benzophenone ketal functioning as a temporary steric control unit. Closure of the enediyne unit was accomplished on a trimethylsilylethoxycarbonyl (TEOC) protected dihydroquinoline derivative. It involved use of a novel bis-iodoalkyne/distannylethylene interpolative coupling transformation (61 + 58 \xe2\x86\x92 63, Scheme 12). In the terminal phase of the synthesis, a novel iminoquinone ketal 74 (Scheme 15) was condensed with homophthalic anhydride derivative 78 (Scheme 16) as indicated in Scheme 17. The final deprotection involved cleavage of a methoxymethyl ester and two methoxymethyl phenol ethers. From this work, there arose the concept and demonstration of p-quinone monoimines 82 and 93 (Scheme 18), as bioreductively activated enediyne prodrugs. "
"Allosamidin, recently isolated from mycelial extracts of Streptomyces sp. 1713, is a powerful and selective chitinase inhibitor. The total synthesis of allosamidin is described herein. The electric eel acetylcholinesterase-mediated enantioselective hydrolysis of (trans,trans)-2-(benzyloxy)cyclopentene-1,3-diol diacetate accessed a monoacetyl derivative. Five additional steps produced a protected version of the aglycon (\xe2\x80\x9callosamizoline\xe2\x80\x9d) sector of allosamidin. An allal derivative stereoselectively reacted with benzenesulfonamide in the presence of a halonium source to afford a 2\xce\xb2-halo-1\xce\xb1-sulfonamidohexose. Treatment of this product with a strong base generated an intermediate 1,2-sulfonylaziridine, which was trapped with a protected allal derivative to provide a disaccharide glycal. Reiteration of this scheme gave access to the required trisaccharide. Following deprotection, the total synthesis of allosamidin was accomplished. In addition, the method, with modification, gave access to several allosamidin analogs. "
"In order to establish the way in which the hydration characteristics of \xce\xb1-amino acids influence their noncovalent interactions with other solutes in aqueous solution, we measured medium effects for the water-catalyzed hydrolysis of an activated amide in aqueous solution in the presence of \xce\xb1-amino acids and some of their derivatives at 25 \xc2\xb0C and pH 4. With the exception of phenylalanine and 3-phenylserine, all common \xce\xb1-amino acids induce significant rate enhancements. The kinetic results are analysed using the thermodynamic description of solute\xe2\x88\x92solute interactions as formulated by Savage and Wood. This procedure allows the evaluation of pairwise Gibbs energy interaction parameters. These parameters neither reflect the hydrophobicity of the \xce\xb1-amino acid side chain nor the additivity of functional group interactions in the cosolute. The carboxylate group in the zwitterionic \xce\xb1-amino acid dominates the rate enhancing kinetic medium effect and reduces the availability of nearby methylene groups for interaction with the apolar initial state of the reaction. Some \xce\xb1-amino acid side chains clearly influence the interaction of the carboxylate group with the reactant, most probably due to destructive hydration shell overlap. Only for phenylalanine and 3-phenylserine are marked rate retardations observed, and presumably the hydrophobic effect of the side chains now dominates over the rate enhancing effect of the carboxylate moiety. The results provide quantitative insights into intermolecular noncovalent interactions between \xce\xb1-amino acids and the activated amide. It is shown that destructive hydration shell overlap effects play a significant role in noncovalent interactions in aqueous solution. "
"Oligopeptide amphiphiles with different dipeptide moieties of \xe2\x88\x92XYNH2 (X = Gly and Ala, Y = Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, and Phe) were synthesized. Binding of aqueous dipeptides onto monolayers of equimolar mixtures of these amphiphiles with a benzoic acid amphiphile (2C18BCOOH) was investigated by \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92A isotherm measurement, FT-IR spectroscopy, and XPS elemental analysis. For given GlyX dipeptides (X = neutral and hydrophobic residues), the binding ratio was lessened with increasing sizes of the side chain of the Y residue in the GlyY dipeptide moiety of the host amphiphiles. The Langmuir-type saturation behavior was observed for binding of GlyLeu to an equimolar monolayer of 2C18BGly2NH2 and 2C18BCOOH. Its binding constant of 475 M-1 was 10 times larger than that observed for a single-component monolayer of 2C18BGly2NH2 (K = 35 M-1). The saturation guest/host ratio was 0.47. The mode of substrate insertion into the binding site was examined by FT-IR spectroscopy. When the hydrophobic residue was on the C-terminal of a guest dipeptide (GlyX), the C-terminal insertion was selected with accompanying formation of cyclic carboxylic acid dimers at the interface. In the case of XGly guests, the N-terminal insertion with salt bridge formation with the host was observed. When the two residues of a dipeptide had close hydrophobicities, both C- and N-terminal insertions were observed. Formation of these binding sites is apparently induced by dipeptide binding. "
"The distribution of products in the photolysis of 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (DBO) is determined by the electronic spin state of the cyclohexane-1,4-diyl intermediate. Triplet cyclohexane-1,4-diyl yields 1,5-hexadiene (HD) while singlet cyclohexane-1,4-diyl produces bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane (BCH) as the stable product. Intersystem crossing (ISC) between the two diyls is enhanced by an external heavy atom effect. Direct photolysis (366 nm) of DBO in NaY zeolite containing adsorbed xenon yields a product ratio of 75:25 in favor of the triplet product, HD. This is a 24% increase in triplet product from direct photolysis in n-octane. The dramatic enhancement of ISC may be caused by polarization of the Xe atom in the faujasite cage, thereby allowing it to reach its full potential as a heavy atom perturbant. The 3:1 product ratio derives from complete equilibration of the three triplet electron spin states and the singlet spin state either in the short-lived diazenyl diradical or on a high-energy surface of the 1,4-cyclohexanediyl in which the singlet and triplet states are degenerate. The same 75:25 product ratio is achieved (without Xe adsorbed to the zeolite) when the Na+ cation of the zeolite is exchanged with Cs+ cation. This is not surprising since Xe and Cs+ are isoelectronic and therefore should share similar spin\xe2\x88\x92orbit coupling characteristics. Also reported are the product ratios when photolysis of DBO is carried out in zeolites containing other monovalent cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+). "
"We report the induction of a ferroelectric SC* phase in two SC liquid crystal hosts using a novel chiral dopant (\xe2\x88\x92)-1 that incorporates an atropisomeric core derived from 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-dihydroxy-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-dimethyl-6,6\xe2\x80\x98-dinitrobiphenyl. The racemic dopant was synthesized in 11 steps with an overall yield of 9% and resolved by chiral stationary phase HPLC in optically pure form. The magnitude and sign of the spontaneous polarization (PS) induced by (\xe2\x88\x92)-1 were found to depend strongly on the nature of the SC host. In a cyclohexanecarbonitrile host, (\xe2\x88\x92)-1 induces a positive polarization that is measurable over the dopant mole fraction range 0.02 < xd < 0.044; in a phenyl benzoate host, (\xe2\x88\x92)-1 induces a negative polarization that falls below detection limit at xd \xe2\x89\xa4 0.05. The polarization power (\xce\xb4p) of (\xe2\x88\x92)-1 in the cyclohexanecarbonitrile host is +170 nC/cm2, which is more than eight times that estimated as upper limit in the phenyl benzoate host. These results are rationalized on the basis of the Boulder model for the molecular origins of PS by modeling the conformational behavior of the biphenyl core in the achiral lattice of the SC host using semiempirical AM1 calculations. The dependence of \xce\xb4p on the nature of the SC host is correlated to the large difference in negative dielectric anisotropy (\xce\xb5\xe2\x88\xa5 \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xb5\xe2\x8a\xa5) of the two hosts.

"The first synthesis of 5\xe2\x80\x98-dithiophosphoryl deoxyoligonucleotides is reported. These oligomers are prepared by reacting O-(9-fluorenemethyl) H-phosphonothioate with an appropriately protected deoxyoligonucleotide and then oxidizing phosphorus with elementary sulfur. By using 35S-sulfur, a long-lived radioactive isotope that is useful for monitoring biological and biochemical experiments can be introduced into deoxyoligonucleotides. 5\xe2\x80\x98-Dithiophosphoryl deoxyoligonucleotides are stable toward alkaline phosphatase and do not serve as substrates for T4-polynucleotide ligase. These oligomers undergo oxidative phosphoryl disulfide formation to yield dimers via an intermolecular reaction or with cysteine to generate an amino acid-deoxyoligonucleotide joined through the 5\xe2\x80\x98-dithiophosphoryl moiety and the cysteine sulfhydryl function.

"Treatment of the chloride bridged species [{M(L)Cl(\xce\xbc-Cl)}2] (M = Ru, L = 4-MeC6H4CHMe2, C6H6, or C6Me6; M = Ir, L = C5Me5) with silver salts AgX (X = BF4, CF3SO3, CF3CO2 etc.) followed by reflux with the bowl-shaped macrocycle cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) results in the clean formation of mono-, di-, and trimetallic CTV complexes [{M(L)}n(CTV)]X2n (n = 1, 2, 3). Further salts (X = ReO4-, I-) may be generated by anion metathesis. All three types of complex display novel host\xe2\x88\x92guest properties. In the case of the monometallic hosts the disruption of the characteristic columnar packing mode of the CTV, a result of the presence of the metal center, leads to the inclusion of neutral and anionic guest species (NO2Me, Et2O, H{CF3CO2}2-, etc.) within the CTV cavity. For complexes where n = 2 or 3 the inclusion of anionic guests is invariably observed. The extent of anion binding has been established by means of X-ray crystal structure determinations upon various di- and trimetallic species containing BF4-, CF3SO3-, or ReO4-, by radiotracer analysis in solution using 99mTcO4- and 188ReO4-, and by cyclic voltammetry. The trimetallic complex [{Ir(Cp*)}3(CTV)][BF4]6 (9a) in particular exhibits F\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7CCTV contacts as short as 2.78(3) \xc3\x85. The dimetallic host [{Ru(\xce\xb76-4-MeC6H4CHMe2)}2(\xce\xb76:\xce\xb76-CTV)]4+ (4) is shown to have a specific affinity for large tetrahedral anions and will selectively extract both 99TcO4- and ReO4- from aqueous solution, even in the presence of a large excess of Cl-, CF3SO3-, NO3-, SO42-, and to some extent ClO4-.

"The reactions of internal and terminal alkynes with organoalanes containing Et, n-Pr, and i-Bu groups in the presence of Cp2ZrCl2 and MeZrCp2Cl were investigated with the goal of clarifying mechanistic details of some representative cases. Three fundamentally different processes, i.e., (i) C\xe2\x88\x92M bond addition without C\xe2\x88\x92H activation in the alkyl group, (ii) cyclic C\xe2\x88\x92M bond addition via C\xe2\x88\x92H activation, and (iii) hydrometalation, have been observed, and the courses of these reactions significantly depend on (i) the nature and number of alkyl groups in organoalanes, (ii) their amounts, and (iii) solvents. The reaction of alkynes with Et3Al in the presence of 0.1 equiv of Cp2ZrCl2 in nonpolar solvents, e.g., hexanes, proceeds via C\xe2\x88\x92H activation to give the corresponding aluminacyclopentenes. Investigation of the reaction of 5-decyne with 1\xe2\x88\x923 equiv of Et3Al and 1 equiv of Cp2ZrCl2, which gave mono-, di-, or trideuterated (Z)-5-ethyl-5-decene as shown in Scheme 10, together with the previously reported structural study on the reaction of Et3Al with Cp2ZrCl2 leading to the formation of well-characterized bimetallic species 9, 10, and 11 (Scheme 11), supports a catalytic cycle involving bimetallic species 10 and 18 (Scheme 15). In summary, this process requires a zirconocene derivative containing one Zr-bound Et group which is linked to Et3Al (but not to Et2AlCl) through a Cl bridge, i.e., 18, to produce 10 via \xce\xb2 C\xe2\x88\x92H activation. In sharp contrast, the reaction of Et2AlCl\xe2\x88\x92Cp2ZrCl2 as well as of (n-Pr)2AlCl\xe2\x88\x92Cp2ZrCl2 does not involve any C\xe2\x88\x92H activation processes. It proceeds well in chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents, e.g., (CH2Cl)2, but it is extremely sluggish in nonpolar solvents, e.g., hexanes. The reaction may well involve direct C\xe2\x88\x92Al bond addition to alkynes, as suggested earlier for Zr-catalyzed Me\xe2\x88\x92Al bond addition to alkynes, but a few other alternatives cannot be ruled out on the basis of the currently available data. The reaction of alkynes with (n-Pr)3Al\xe2\x88\x92Cp2ZrCl2 in nonpolar solvents proceeds partially via C\xe2\x88\x92H activation and partially via hydrometalation. In contrast with the C\xe2\x88\x92H activation process observed with Et3Al, that with (n-Pr)3Al is totally dominated by dimerization of alkynes to give aluminacyclopentadienes rather than aluminacyclopentenes, reflecting a previously established generalization that propene can be much more readily displaced from Zr by alkynes than ethylene. Hydrometalation is the exclusive process with (i-Bu)3Al\xe2\x88\x92Cp2ZrCl2. This hydrometalation reaction, however, reveals a few interesting complications. Alkyl-substituted internal alkynes give double bond migrated products in addition to the expected hydrometalation products. With terminal alkynes the reaction produces the expected hydrometalation products and the 1,1-dimetalloalkanes in comparable yields. Various other related reactions involving other alkynes, e.g., PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeCPh, n-OctC\xe2\x8b\xaeCH, and PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeCH, and other reagents, e.g., Et3Al\xe2\x88\x92MeZrCp2Cl, Et2AlCl\xe2\x88\x92MeZrCp2Cl, and (n-Pr)3Al\xe2\x88\x92MeZrCp2Cl, were also studied.

"In the reaction of octacarbonyl dicobalt with 3-methyl-1,2-butadiene at room temperature dinuclear \xce\xb73-allyl-type complexes are formed which contain 2 + n (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7) five-carbon units depending on the applied molar ratio. These complexes are the individual compounds in the octacarbonyl dicobalt-initiated living polymerization of 3-methyl-1,2-butadiene. The first three members in this series of complexes containing two (1), three (2), and four (3) five-carbon units have been isolated and characterized by IR, Raman, 1H, and 13C NMR spectroscopies, molecular weight, and for 1 and 2 also by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The first two molecules of 3-methyl-1,2-butadiene establish the formation of two (\xce\xb73-3,3-dimethylallyl)cobalt tricarbonyl parts which are linked together at the central allylic carbon by a carbonyl group. By the addition of 3-methyl-1,2-butadiene in excess, the monomer inserts into the unsubstituted allylic carbon\xe2\x88\x92cobalt bond in a 1,2-fashion, pushing the cobalt atoms further apart. The X-ray structures of 1 and 2 disclose that the 1,2-polymer chain grows in a helical manner. The rate of the insertion of the monomer is first order with respect of both the 3-methyl-1,2-butadiene and the dicobalt complex and is negative first order with respect of carbon monoxide. The observed rate constants of the formation of 1\xe2\x88\x923 at 30 \xc2\xb0C are 14.3 \xc3\x97 10-4, 1.75 \xc3\x97 10-4, and 0.79 \xc3\x97 10-4 s-1, reproducible to within 5, 10, and 7%, respectively.

"Palladium catalyzed intramolecular [3 + 2] cycloadditions of diastereomerically pure methylenecyclopropanes MCPs have been investigated. The reaction was found to be stereospecific and occurred with retention of configuration at the carbon center undergoing reaction. A variety of substitution patterns were tolerated on and around the MCP. Deuterium labeling studies have been conducted, and information about the rate of the reaction was obtained. A mechanism has been proposed involving \xcf\x80-allyl intermediates. Pd2(dba)3/P(OiPr)3 was a suitable catalyst for most cycloadditions, but molecular sieves or Pd(PPh3)4 improved the reaction with some substrates. 1,4-Addition of hydride or a carbanion to the enoate was achieved with high selectivity at the newly formed stereocenter. The allylic alcohol was selectively epoxidized with VO(acac)2/t-BuOOH. "
"Ruthenium complexes 1a and 1b have been applied to the ring-closing metathesis (RCM) reactions of a number of dienic substrates. The substrate scope includes rings of 6 to 20 members. In addressing macrocyclic peptides, a class of tetrapeptide disulfides inspired the synthesis of the carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon bond analogs. Replacement of cysteine residues with allylglycines resulted in the acyclic precursors which were subjected to RCM to afford the corresponding macrocycles. In addition, several macrocycles were prepared which were not based upon disulfide-bridge-containing species found in nature. The method was found to function on dienic peptides which were either dissolved in organic solvents or bound to solid supports. "
"The electron spin resonance spectra of Mn2+ exchanged zeolite A have been investigated as a function of the monovalent co-cation (K+, Na+, Li+, Cs+, or NH4+), Mn2+ content, recording frequency, and temperature. Three new Mn2+ species are observed with a well-resolved fine structure; this allows for the first time a direct quantitative determination of the zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters in zeolites. In hydrated zeolites, three ESR active Mn2+ species are observed, characterized by different values for the ZFS parameter D. Species I has D = 0.035 cm-1. Species II is closer to a regular octahedron, with D = 0.010 cm-1. Species III, with D = 0.14 cm-1, is in a strongly axially distorted coordination. Species I is dominant in MnKA, MnCsA, and MnNH4A, while II and III are found in MnNaA and MnLiA. In fully dehydrated zeolites, two species are observed. Species IV has a small hyperfine constant A and is present in dry NaA and KA. Species V is observed in dry LiA; it has axial symmetry with a large, temperature-dependent D. Species V probably represents Mn2+ in a 3-fold coordination in a 6-ring. In partially hydrated zeolites, a tetrahedral species VI is observed. The spectroscopic data elucidate the location of manganese(II) ions in zeolite A, particularly at relatively low metal loadings. "
"The series of (1-terpenylindenyl)2ZrCl2 bent metallocene complexes (with terpenyl substituents neomenthyl, neoisomenthyl, menthyl, and isomenthyl) were obtained from the reaction of the respective 1-terpenylindenyl lithium reagents with ZrCl4. In each case a single racem-like diastereoisomer was isolated pure by crystallization. The conformational analysis of the bent metallocene systems was carried out by variable temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy. It has revealed the existence and equilibration of three different bent metallocene torsional isomers. Two of these are C2-symmetric and carry their bulky terpenyl substituents either in the lateral or the front sector of the bent metallocene wedge (descriptors bis-lateral:anti (conformer A) and bis-central:syn (conformer B)), whereas the rotational isomer C (central,lateral:gauche) is of lower symmetry. The (1-terpenylindenyl)2ZrCl2/methylalumoxane systems are active propene polymerization catalysts. The equilibrium amount of the \xe2\x80\x9cstereochemically productive\xe2\x80\x9d C2-symmetric bis-lateral:anti bent metallocene conformer A correlates qualitatively with the observed isotacticity of the propene polymerization process at the respective group 4 bent metallocene catalyst system.

"31P multiple-quantum solid-state NMR spectroscopy is introduced as a new approach for elucidating internuclear distances between phosphorus nuclei in phosphates. The typical shorter distance between chemically bound groups allows the determination of the chemical network. The method is superior to 31P exchange experiments, which, in principle, provide similar information. Separation of two crystalline Mg2P2O7 phases is observed by both methods, but the double-quantum experiment gives further information of couplings between sites with equal isotropic chemical shifts. In Ca2P6Ol7, which contains Q2 and Q3 groups with large chemical shift anisotropies, the connectivities can be deduced from the double-quantum experiment due to different cross-peak intensities. Our results are in good agreement with X-ray diffraction measurements and suggest applications to other, more complicated phosphates. "
"Perylene-terminated monodendrons 1\xe2\x88\x927 and phenyl-terminated reference monodendrons 8\xe2\x88\x9214 have been synthesized, and the intramolecular energy transfer has been studied using steady-state as well as time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. In the series 2\xe2\x88\x927, the light-harvesting ability of these compounds increases with increasing generation due to the increase in molar extinction coefficient. However, the efficiency of the energy transfer decreases with increasing generation in this series. With increasing generation, the photoluminescence intensity from the perylene core still increases and the expected level-off in the photoluminescence intensity has not been reached in this series of compounds. Dendrimer 1 is unique in that the energy transfer in this molecule occurs at a very fast rate. The rate constant for energy transfer in 1 is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than in 2\xe2\x88\x927. In contrast to monodendrons 2\xe2\x88\x927, 1 possesses a variable monomer type at each generation that creates an energy funnel. The ultrafast energy transfer in this system is best explained by the presence of this energy gradient. "
"We have studied the temperature and adsorbate concentration dependence of alkanethiol/gold monolayer formation in situ and in real time using a quartz crystal microbalance to monitor the rate of reaction. The temperature dependence of the experimental rate constants, for a given concentration, demonstrates that the formation of these monolayers is not diffusion rate limited for the conditions we report here. Our data are modeled accurately by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and, using this model, we have determined the adsorption and desorption rate constants for monolayer self assembly. We have extracted from these data the thermodynamic quantities \xce\x94Gads, \xce\x94Hads, and \xce\x94Sads for monolayer formation. For 1-octadecanethiol adsorption from n-hexane onto gold, \xce\x94Gads is temperature dependent and is ca. \xe2\x88\x925.5 kcal/mol, \xce\x94Hads = \xe2\x88\x9220 \xc2\xb1 1 kcal/mol, and \xce\x94Sads = \xe2\x88\x9248 \xc2\xb1 1 cal/(mol\xc2\xb7K). These data have direct bearing on the broader field of interface chemistry because they underscore the dominant role that entropy plays in determining the course of chemical reactions at interfaces and the robustness of the resulting molecular assembly. We discuss the implications of these data on the stability of the monolayers and the limits that these values place on the extent of experimental control available over their formation. "
"Guided ion beam mass spectrometry has been used to examine the kinetic energy dependence of reactions of FeL+ (L = CO and H2O) with methane and ethane. Carbon\xe2\x88\x92hydrogen and carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon bond activation is observed, and there is no evidence for direct interaction of either ligand in the chemistry. Thresholds for these processes are measured and converted to the following LFe+\xe2\x88\x92CH3 0 K bond dissociation energies (BDEs):\xe2\x80\x89 D0[(CO)Fe+\xe2\x88\x92CH3] = 1.30 \xc2\xb1 0.05 eV and D0[(H2O)Fe+\xe2\x88\x92CH3] = 1.95 \xc2\xb1 0.10 eV. Comparison of these values to the previously determined D0(Fe+\xe2\x88\x92CH3) = 2.37 \xc2\xb1 0.05 eV and to D0(LFe+\xe2\x88\x92D) bond energies permits a quantitative assessment of the effects of ligation on \xcf\x83-bond activation by metal complexes. Differences in the abilities of the two FeL+ species to activate methane and ethane are compared to the behavior of the two complexes activating D2. As in the D2 case, \xcf\x83 bond activation of these alkanes by Fe(H2O)+ is more efficient than Fe(CO)+ at low energies. This result is rationalized in terms of different electronic structures at the ligated metal ion centers. In addition, it is found that the selectivity of the reactions is affected by ligation, such that Fe(CO)+ activates the C\xe2\x88\x92H and C\xe2\x88\x92C bonds of ethane with comparable efficiency, while Fe(H2O)+ prefers to activate the C\xe2\x88\x92H bonds.

"Unimolecular dissociation of ionized, deuterium-substituted propyl phenyl ethers has been investigated by means of photoionization mass spectrometry as a technique for insuring that different isotopomers can be compared at the same internal energy. Elimination of neutral propene is the only ionic fragmentation detected in the energy domain studied but is found to take place via competing pathways. The contrast between measured fragment ion ratios from parent ions having internal energies 0.8 eV above the dissociation barriers, HOPh\xe2\x80\xa2+:DOPh\xe2\x80\xa2+ = 1.23 for PhOCH2CH2CD3 (1c) versus HOPh\xe2\x80\xa2+:DOPh\xe2\x80\xa2+ \xe2\x89\xa5 1.38 for PhOCH(CD3)CH3 (4b), demonstrates that 4b\xe2\x80\xa2+ is not an obligatory intermediate in the dissociation of 1c\xe2\x80\xa2+. Examination of ten other deuterated analogues of n-propyl phenyl ether permits an assignment of branching ratios. There are two ways to interpret the data using first-order kinetics:\xe2\x80\x89 a phenomenological analysis (which considers the contributions from different chain positions) and a mechanistic analysis (which considers competition among four pathways). These two analyses lead to different conclusions, and the mechanistic analysis is to be preferred. For 1c the molecular ion decomposes predominantly (>90%) via a [CD3CHCH3+ PhO\xe2\x80\xa2] ion\xe2\x88\x92neutral complex, with an additional 7% passing through complexes that randomize hydrogen within the propyl cation. Only 1% of ionized 1c fragments via site-specific \xce\xb2-transfer from the propyl side chain. Slightly more than 1% decomposes via site-specific \xce\xb3-transfer, which can be ascribed to intervention of ion\xe2\x88\x92neutral complexes containing unrearranged, corner-protonated cyclopropanes. Correction for these alternative pathways leads to the conclusion that the primary isotope effect for the Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid-base reaction between isopropyl cation and phenoxy radical within ion\xe2\x88\x92neutral complexes has a value kH/kD = 1.21. Proportions of the various pathways for ionized n-propyl phenyl ethers depend on the isotopic substitution pattern. Nearly one-sixth of PhOCD2CH2CD3 (1d) molecular ions decompose via site-specific \xce\xb2-transfer or \xce\xb3-transfer (in a ratio of 1:1.1). The increased competition in this d5 analogue accounts for the reported conformational dependence of its supersonic jet/REMPI mass spectrum. "
"By using specially constructed nanometer tips of sharpened Pt-Ir wire in a wax sheath, small numbers of molecules (1\xe2\x88\x9210) can be trapped between the tip and a substrate. Repeated electron transfers of an electroactive molecule as it shuttles by diffusion between tip and substrate produce a current (\xe2\x88\xbc0.6 pA/molecule) that can be used to detect the trapped molecules. The tip electrode size and shape can be found from the electrode approach curves (current vs tip-to-substrate distance) based on approximate equations and digital simulations. Analysis of the observed fluctuating currents by autocorrelation, spectral density, and probability density functions is also described. "
"A p(2\xc3\x973)-N Ag(110) surface obtained by N+ and/or N2+ ion bombardment gave a desorption peak of N2 at 530 K. When this p(2\xc3\x973)-N Ag(110) surface was exposed to O2 at room temperature, the LEED pattern showed a combined structure of [p(2\xc3\x973)-N + p(2\xc3\x971)-O]. The STM image proved the growth of the (\xe2\x88\x92Ag\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92) and (Ag2N) strings in the [001] and [11\xcc\x840] directions, respectively. The TPD spectrum of the combined surface gave the desorption of N2 at 530 K, NO at 490\xe2\x88\x92520 K, and O2 at 600 K. When this [p(2\xc3\x973)-N + p(2\xc3\x971)-O] Ag(110) surface was illuminated with a UV light at room temperature, the (\xe2\x88\x92Ag\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92) strings in the STM image were selectively erased although the (Ag2N) underwent little influence, and the LEED pattern changed to the p(2\xc3\x973)-N structure. The TPD spectrum of the surface after the illumination gave only N2. These results indicate that surface migration of N atoms triggers the reaction between N and N yielding N2 as well as N and O yielding NO on the surface. Selective photobleaching for the combined structure may suggest a feasibility of atomic scale lithography of the surface by using photochemical reactions. "
"Slow exchange processes in the solution of the 1,1\xe2\x80\x98-dihydroxy-2,2\xe2\x80\x98,6,6\xe2\x80\x98-tetra-tert-butylbiphenyl cation radical (tBBP\xe2\x80\xa2+) in concentrated sulfuric acid were investigated by two-dimensional (2D) exchange FT-EPR spectroscopy (EXSY) in the temperature range of 281\xe2\x88\x92310 K. The radical was obtained by dissolving 2,2\xe2\x80\x98,6,6\xe2\x80\x98-tetra-tert-butyldiphenoquinone (tBDP) in concentrated sulfuric acid. The EPR spectrum of the radical cation, tBBP\xe2\x80\xa2+, showed that the four aromatic protons and the two hydroxyl protons are magnetically equivalent. The 2D EXSY spectra exhibited cross peaks between hyperfine components with = \xc2\xb11 and = \xc2\xb11, where a and b correspond to the aromatic and hydroxyl protons, respectively. Based on this selective cross-peak pattern, the change in the nuclear quantum number of the aromatic protons was attributed to proton spin\xe2\x88\x92lattice relaxation. In contrast, the change in the nuclear quantum number of the hydroxyl protons could arise from proton exchange with the solvent and/or nuclear spin\xe2\x88\x92lattice relaxation. Temperature-dependent measurements showed that the intensity of the cross peaks decreased with increasing temperatures, indicating that in the case of the hydroxyl protons the cross peaks are also a consequence of nuclear relaxation and not proton exchange. The nuclear spin\xe2\x88\x92lattice relaxation rates of the two types of protons and the electron spin\xe2\x88\x92lattice relaxation, T1, were determined from simulations of experimental 2D spectra recorded with different mixing times. The values obtained at 291 K were = (9 \xc2\xb1 1) \xc3\x97 105 s-1 and = (4 \xc2\xb1 1) \xc3\x97 105 s-1 and T1 = (0.83 \xc2\xb1 0.06) \xc3\x97 105 s-1. Using the nuclear relaxation rate of the aromatic protons and assuming that the nuclear relaxation is dominated by the hyperfine anisotropy mechanism, a correlation time of 0.67 \xc3\x97 10-9 s was obtained. This value was further used to account for the MI dependence of the line width. Similar temperature-dependent 2D EXSY measurements were carried out on the dihydroduroquinone radical cation in sulfuric acid. In this case, the cross peaks observed were attributed to both proton exchange and nuclear spin relaxation of the hydroxyl protons. The proton exchange in the dihydroduroquinone radical cation was faster than in tBBP\xe2\x80\xa2+. "
"The reaction between phenyllithium and substituted o-quinones (3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone (TBQ), 1,2-naphthoquinone, 9,10-phenanthrenequinone) results in the oxidation of C6H5- to C6H5\xe2\x80\xa2, with the subsequent formation of biphenyl. Metathetical reactions yield M(TBSQ) (M = Li, Na, K; TBSQ- = 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzosemiquinone) and the adduct Li(TBSQ)bpy (bpy = 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine). Solutions of Li(TBSQ) + pyridine in toluene contain triradical species, and analysis of the EPR spectra leads to values for the spin\xe2\x88\x92spin parameters. Similar results have been obtained for Na(TBSQ). An ideal structure has been calculated for [Li(C6H4O2\xe2\x80\xa2)]3; the magnetic properties for the resultant model are in good agreement with the experimental values, and the bond distances and angles with those for known oligomeric lithium complexes.

"Chemically stable poly[2-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-oxyphenyl)-1,4(p)-phenylenevinylene], poly[4-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-oxyphenyl)-1,3(m)-phenylenevinylene], and poly[4-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-oxyphenyl)-1,2(o)-phenylenevinylene] were synthesized via the polymerization of 4-bromo-2-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-acetoxyphenyl)styrene, 5-bromo-2-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-acetoxyphenyl)styrene, and 2-bromo-4-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-acetoxyphenyl)styrene, respectively, using a palladium catalyst. The o- and p-polyradicals, even with their spin concentration of 0.6 spin/unit, displayed S values of 4/2 to 5/2 (S = 5/2 for the o-polyradical with a degree of polymerization of 17 and a spin concentration of 0.68), while the m-polyradical has a singlet ground state. A long-range intramolecular through-bond ferromagnetic exchange interaction was realized between the pendant unpaired electrons for the o- and p-polyradicals, in accordance with theoretical predictions based on the molecular connectivity. The average value of the exchange coupling constant for the o-polyradical, 2J\xcc\x84 = 48 \xc2\xb1 6 cm-1, was larger than 2J\xcc\x84 = 32 \xc2\xb1 2 cm-1 for the p-polyradical, while they were almost coincident with or much larger than the exchange coupling constants for the corresponding diradical model compounds. Both force field calculations and spectroscopic results indicated a less hindered steric structure with a planarized \xcf\x80-conjugated skeleton for the o-polyradical. "
"We have examined the UV resonance Raman and the VUV absorption spectra of aqueous glycylglycine and other dipeptides. We observe strong resonance Raman enhancement of the amide I, II, and III bands and the amide C\xce\xb1H bending mode in a manner similar to that we observed previously with excitation within the \xcf\x80\xe2\x86\x92\xcf\x80* transition of N-methylacetamide (Chen, X. G.; Asher, S. A.; Schweitzer-Stenner, R.; Mirkin, N. G.; Krimm, S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 2884). However, in addition, we observe strong resonance Raman enhancement of the ca. 1400 cm-1 symmetric COO- stretching vibration, whose 206.5 nm Raman cross section is increased 20-fold compared to that of the carboxylate in sodium acetate, for example. Addition of a methylene spacer between the amide and carboxylate groups causes the resonance Raman enhancement of this symmetric COO- stretch to disappear. The UV resonance Raman excitation profiles, the Raman depolarization ratio dispersion, and the VUV absorption spectra of glycylglycine and other dipeptides demonstrate the existence of a new 197 nm charge transfer band which involves electron transfer from a nonbonding carboxylate orbital to the amide-like \xcf\x80* orbital. This transition occurs at the penultimate carboxylate end of all peptides and proteins. "
"We have grown a novel crystal of hydrated gycylglycine (Gly-Gly), determined its crystal structure, and measured its Raman tensor at 488, and 244 nm, close to resonance. This crystal has 8 molecules of (Gly-Gly) and 12 molecules of water per unit cell. The Gly-Gly hydrogen-bonds in a \xce\xb2-sheet-like structure where all of the amide planes are parallel. We report here the development of a general method to use preresonance single-crystal Raman measurements to determine the direction of the molecular electronic transition moments. We utilize the UV (244 nm) excited Raman tensor and relationships derived here to accurately determine the transition moment orientation of the amide and carboxylate group \xcf\x80\xe2\x86\x92\xcf\x80* transitions and the orientation of a charge transfer transition from the carboxylate group to the amide group. The amide \xcf\x80\xe2\x86\x92\xcf\x80* (NV1) transition moment is found to be in the peptide plane at an angle of \xe2\x88\x9246\xc2\xb0 \xc2\xb1 3\xc2\xb0 to the amide carbonyl bond. The carboxylate \xcf\x80\xe2\x86\x92\xcf\x80* (NV1\xe2\x80\x98) transition moment is oriented almost parallel to a line connecting the carboxylate oxygens (4.6\xc2\xb0 off), as theoretically expected. The charge transfer band from the carboxylate to the amide chromophore is found at an angle of \xe2\x88\x9283\xc2\xb0 \xc2\xb1 3\xc2\xb0 to the amide carbonyl bond, almost along the line of intersection of the amide and carboxylate planes.

"Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry calculations have been combined to describe the dark adaptation in bacteriorhodopsin (bR). The process involves the reversible thermally activated transformation of retinal from an all-trans to a 13-cis,15-syn configuration. The potential surface governing the thermal isomerization of retinal around two (13\xe2\x88\x9214, 15\xe2\x88\x92N) double bonds has been determined for representative protein configurations taken from molecular dynamics trajectories. CASSCF(8,8)/6-31G level ab initio calculations (within Gaussian94) were carried out for this purpose. The charge distributions of all atoms in the protein are represented by partial point charges and explicitly included in the electronic Hamiltonian. Placement of retinal into bR is found to reduce the calculated isomerization barrier. Thermal fluctuations of the protein lead to a further effective reduction of this barrier. The isomerization process is shown to be catalyzed by the protonation of an aspartic acid (Asp85) side group of bacteriorhodopsin. "
"A theoretical study of the electronic structure of some aniline derivatives is performed, aimed at a microscopic explanation of the observed polymerizability of these compounds. Monomers with methyl and methoxy substituents located at various positions on the benzenoid ring are considered using the density functional theory program deMon-KS. The calculations indicate that the distribution of the net radical cation spin among the atoms (atomic spin populations) is very sensitive to the nature and the position of the substituents. In fact this distribution reflects specifics of the electronic structure of these monomers related to their polymerizability. It is shown that polymerization is favored when the net spin population on the nitrogen atom is similar to that on the ring carbon atom at the para position. On the contrary, in the species that do not polymerize, these two atoms have substantially different spin populations. A possible explanation of this result is discussed in terms of chemical reactivity based on the softness\xe2\x88\x92hardness concept. "
"Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is an important neurotrophic protein implicated in Alzheimer\'s disease, epilepsy, and pain. Although the amino and carboxyl termini enable an NGF\'s recognition by its TrkA receptor, their conformations have not been resolved in recent crystallographic studies. Variable Basis Monte Carlo simulated annealing calculations are utilized to study low-energy conformational space of the NGF termini of three highly active and three inactive NGF analogues in order to determine their bioactive conformation. The complex of the NGF termini splits into two distinct moieties:\xe2\x80\x89 a rigid region (residues 9-11 and 112\xe2\x80\x98-118\xe2\x80\x98) and a flexible loop (residues 1-8). The geometry of the rigid region, which is maintained by electrostatic interaction between Glu11 and Arg118\xe2\x80\x98, is conserved in active molecules only. The separation of the flexible loop from the rigid region is necessary in order to eliminate an influence of the loop on the biologically active conformation of the rigid region. Experimentally observed structure\xe2\x88\x92activity relationships can be explained using this structural model. "
"As a first step toward modeling the photoinduced repair of DNA, electronic structure calculations on the cleavage reaction of various pyrimidine dimers (uracil, thymine, and cytosine) as well as of their anion and cation radicals have been carried out using the AM1 UHF method. Two different paths of the splitting reaction have been studied by locating all stationary points. Along the first path, the opening of the cyclobutane ring is initiated by breaking the C5\xe2\x88\x92C5\xe2\x80\x98 bond which leads to the formation of an intermediate, followed by the cleavage of the C6\xe2\x88\x92C6\xe2\x80\x98 bond; along the second path, the two C\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x80\x98 bonds are broken in reverse order. The results for the dimer anion radical favor a cleavage reaction along the first path while the second path is preferred for the cation radicals. Electron transfer to the dimers does not appreciably influence the enthalpy of the reaction for cycloreversion in the uracil and thymine dimers; however, it causes a dramatic reduction of the activation barrier for the cleavage reaction. In contrast, the reactivity of the cytosine dimer is only weakly affected by this electron uptake. Differences in the various reaction profiles are rationalized by invoking an energetic stabilization associated with the charge delocalization between fragments in the corresponding transition states. The calculated solvent effects evaluated by a dielectric continuum model show that the splitting reaction is sensitive to a polar environment. The reaction barriers of the splitting reaction are found to increase with the polarity of the medium, rationalizing the experimentally observed solvent effects on the dimer cleavage. "
"A potential energy surface for the reaction of vinyl radical with molecular oxygen has been studied using the ab initio G2M(RCC,MP2) method. The most favorable reaction pathway leading to the major CHO + CH2O products is the following:\xe2\x80\x89 C2H3 + O2 \xe2\x86\x92 vinylperoxy radical 1 or 1\xe2\x80\x98 \xe2\x86\x92 TS 8 \xe2\x86\x92 dioxiranylmethyl radical 3 \xe2\x86\x92 TS 9\xe2\x80\x98 oxiranyloxy radical 10 \xe2\x86\x92 TS 11 \xe2\x86\x92 formyloxymethyl radical 12\xe2\x80\x98 \xe2\x86\x92 TS 13\xe2\x80\x98 \xe2\x86\x92 CHO + CH2O, where the rate-determining step is oxygen migration to the CC bridging position via TS 9\xe2\x80\x98, lying below the reactants by 14.3 kcal/mol. The C2H3O + O products can be formed by elimination of the oxygen atom from C2H3OO via TS 23, which is by 7.8 kcal/mol lower in energy than the reactants, but by 6.5 kcal/mol higher than TS 9\xe2\x80\x98. The hydrogen migration in 1\xe2\x80\x98 gives rise to another significant product channel:\xe2\x80\x89 C2H3 + O2 \xe2\x86\x92 1\xe2\x80\x98 \xe2\x86\x92 TS 25\xe2\x80\x98 \xe2\x86\x92 C2H2 + O2H, with TS 25\xe2\x80\x98 lying below C2H3 + O2 by 3.5 kcal/mol. Multichannel RRKM calculations have been carried out for the total and individual rate constants for various channels using the G2M(RCC,MP2) energetics and molecular parameters of the intermediates and transition states. The computed low pressure reaction rate constant is in quantitative agreement with experiment. At atmospheric pressure, the title reaction is dominated by the stabilization of vinylperoxy radical C2H3OO at room temperature. In the 500\xe2\x88\x92900 K temperature range, the CHO + CH2O channel has the highest rate constant, and at T \xe2\x89\xa5 900 K, C2H3O + O are the major products. At very high temperatures, the channel producing C2H2 + O2H becomes competitive. "
"Unimolecular and bimolecular methane eliminations of TiMe4 have been studied using ab initio molecular orbital theory. Geometry optimizations were performed with the 3-21G and HW3 (equivalent to the 6\xe2\x88\x9231G*) basis sets. The energies were further evaluated with the MP2/HW3 calculations. We predict a high activation energy for unimolecular methane elimination but a low activation energy for bimolecular methane elimination. For Ti(CH2CMe3)4, neopentane elimination through \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb3-hydrogen abstractions has been studied with the 3-21G basis set. We predict an intrinsic preference for \xce\xb1-hydrogen abstraction over \xce\xb3-hydrogen abstraction. This preference is enhanced by the bulkiness of the alkyl ligands. "
"Lyophilized subtilisin Carlsberg exhibits \xe2\x80\x9cpH memory\xe2\x80\x9d in organic solvents, i.e., its catalytic activity in such media is profoundly affected by the pH of the aqueous solution from which the enzyme was lyophilized. In contrast, cross-linked crystalline subtilisin displays no appreciable pH memory. This disparate behavior is rationalized in terms of the different protonation states of the two enzyme preparations in organic solvents. Since cross-linked crystals (CLCs) of enzymes in organic solvents offer performance and mechanistic advantages over their lyophilized counterparts, the opportunities for pH maximizing their catalytic activity in such media are explored. It is found that subtilisin CLCs in pentanone can be activated more than 100-fold by adding a \xe2\x80\x9cbuffer\xe2\x80\x9d consisting of a mixture of a suitable acid and its sodium salt (conjugate base). The maximal activation is achieved (i) when the pKa value of the buffer acid in water lies in the appropriate range, (ii) at an optimal acid/base composition of the buffer mixture, and (iii) when the buffer mixture is present in a sufficient concentration.

"A series of crown boronic acids, 1\xe2\x88\x924, were synthesized and studied as carriers for catecholamine transport through bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) and supported liquid membranes (SLMs). Carrier 1 greatly facilitated the transport of primary catecholamines through BLMs; whereas, the more lipophilic analogues 3 and 4 were less effective. A combination of kinetic, mass spectral, and NMR evidence suggests that the transported species in BLMs is the cyclic, zwitterionic, 1:1 complex 7. The SLM transport studies used a liquid membrane of 2-nitrophenyl octyl ether supported by a thin, flat sheet of porous polypropylene. In the absence of carrier there was neglible dopamine transport (<5 \xc3\x97 10-9 mol/m2\xc2\xb7s) at pH 7.2. When the membrane contained carrier 3 (33 mM or about 2% wt), facilitated catecholamine transport was observed in the order of dopamine (5 \xc3\x97 10-7 mol/m2\xc2\xb7s) > epinephrine (1.5 \xc3\x97 10-7 mol/m2\xc2\xb7s) > norepinephrine (0.8 \xc3\x97 10-7 mol/m2\xc2\xb7s). SLMs containing carrier 3 were stable, implying that carrier 3 is a very good candidate for transport mechanism studies. Crown boronic acid 4 was an even better transport carrier of primary catecholamines with a transport order of norepinephrine (4.7 \xc3\x97 10-6 mol/m2\xc2\xb7s) > dopamine (3.5 \xc3\x97 10-6 mol/m2\xc2\xb7s) \xe2\x89\xab epinephrine (3 \xc3\x97 10-8 mol/m2\xc2\xb7s). It is 10 times more effective than an equimolar mixture of boronic acid 5 and crown 6, which is one of best examples of ditopic cooperativity yet observed in SLM transport. SLMs containing 4, however, did not exibit long-term stability. Overall, it is possible that a device based on SLMs containing crown boronic acid carriers can be developed to selectively extract catecholamines from clinical samples. "
"A pair of isomeric acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) analogs have been prepared in which the thioester group is replaced with a secondary alcohol. The two isomers differ in stereoconfiguration of the secondary alcohol and were designed to mimic the two possible configurations of the tetrahedral intermediate or transition state in the reactions of acetyl-CoA dependent acetyltransferases. These two isomers were tested as inhibitors of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and carnitine acetyltransferase, both of which have previously been predicted to form a tetrahedral intermediate which matches the configuration of the (S)-alcohol. The (S)-isomer was the more potent inhibitor of both enzymes, with Ki values 12-fold and 6-fold lower than the Ki values for the (R)-isomer. The (S)-isomer was also the more potent inhibitor of phosphate acetyltransferase, acetyl-CoA synthetase, and arylamine acetyltransferase, for which the stereochemistry of the tetrahedral intermediate was previously unknown. These results suggest a common stereoconfiguration of the tetrahedral intermediate among acetyl-CoA dependent acetyltransferases. "
"Photostimulated additions of tert-butylmercury halides to 1,6-dienes and enynes, including (CH2CHCH2)2X with X = CH2, C(COEt)2, O, or NCH2CHCH2, form the primary alkylmercury halides resulting from 5-exo-cyclizations of the adduct radicals, t-BuCH2CH\xe2\x80\xa2CH2XCH2CHCH2. The kinetic chain lengths of these free-radical processes are low and in the range of 3\xe2\x88\x927 at 35 \xc2\xb0C in Me2SO. 5-Exo-cyclizations with kinetic chain lengths of \xe2\x88\xbc100 are observed in the photostimulated addition of t-BuHgI to CH2CHP(O)(OR)OCH2CHCH2 (R = H or allyl), CH2CHC(O)N(R)CH2CHCH2 (R = Me, Ph, or CH2CHCH2), or CH2CHC(O)OC(Me)2CHCH2. The radicals t-BuCH2CH\xe2\x80\xa2C(O)C(Me)2(CH2)nCHCH2 cyclize mainly in the 6-endo mode for n = 1 and more rapidly in the 6-exo mode for n = 2, while the radicals t-BuCH2CH\xe2\x80\xa2C(O)OC(Me)2(CH2)nCHCH2 cyclize only in the exo mode for n = 0 or 1 but with a faster rate for 5-exo-cyclization. Gem-dimethyl substitution adjacent to the alkyl oxygen accelerates the 5-exo-cyclization of the ester radicals because of rotamer populations but retards their 6-exo-cyclization because of the boatlike transition state required to maintain planarity of the ester function in forming a \xce\xb4-lactone. "
"New tricyclic hexacoordinated phosphoranes 1\xe2\x88\x926 with internal N\xe2\x86\x92P coordination containing ring sizes varying from five to eight membered have been synthesized by oxidative addition of a quinone or a diol to a cyclic phosphite. The bicyclic phosphorane (NC9H6O)P(O2(3,5-t-Bu)2C6H2)((O-2,4-(t-Bu)2C6H2)2CH2)\xc2\xb71/2H2O (7\xc2\xb71/2H2O) has been synthesized by adding the 3,5-di-tert-butyl-o-benzoquinone to the cyclic phosphite. The compound (NC9H6O)P(2,2\xe2\x80\x98-OC6H4C6H4O)2 (6) results from a novel ring exchange reaction of a phosphorinane by a phosphepin in two ways:\xe2\x80\x89 (a) by treating (OCH2CMe2CH2O)P((OC9H6N) with 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-biphenol/N-chlorodiisopropylamine and (b) by treating (Et2N)P(OCH2CMe2CH2O)(2,2\xe2\x80\x98-OC6H4C6H4O) with 8-hydroxyquinoline. Treatment of the aminophosphorane (Et2N)P(OCH2CMe2CH2O)(O2C14H8) with 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoic acid led to the unique ester (OCH2CMe2CH2O)P(O){OC14H8O(C(O)-2,4,6-Me3C6H2)} (10). 31P NMR data for the new compounds are discussed with respect to the differing ring sizes and coordination number on phosphorus. X-ray analysis shows hexacoordination in 2, 4, and 6 with an N\xe2\x86\x92P bond and pentacoordination in 7 without an N\xe2\x86\x92P bond. The coordinating nitrogen is trans to an oxygen of the six-membered ring in 2 and of the seven-membered ring in 4. The eight-membered ring in 7 spans a diequatorial position in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement. "
"A theoretical analysis on planar and puckered-ring conformations of cyclopentadiene, 2,3-dihydrofuran, and 1,3-dioxole is carried out to test the conclusion of Laane and co-workers (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 12132) that the unexpected nonplanarity of 1,3-dioxole must be attributed to the anomeric effect. MP4/6-31G**//MP2/6-31G** calculations and NBO analysis show that delocalization involving the oxygen lone pairs and the C\xe2\x88\x92O antibonding orbital, commonly associated with the anomeric effect, plays a decisive role in explaining the above-mentioned experimental fact. A careful analysis of the dipole\xe2\x88\x92dipole interaction energy indicates that, in the present case, the electrostatic theory does not help to rationalize the experimentally observed puckered-ring conformation of 1,3-dioxole.

"The rational design, synthesis, and characterization of the building blocks obtained by the esterification of the first generation of tapered monodendrons 3,4,5-tris(p-dodecan-1-yloxy)benzoic acid (12-AG) and 3,4,5-tris[p-(n-dodecan-1-yloxy)benzyloxy]benzoic acid (12-ABG) containing semifluorinated dodecyl groups [i.e., 12Fn-AG-15C5 (n = 0, 4, 6, 8), 12Fn-AG-B15C5, 12Fn-ABG-15C5, and 12Fn-ABG-B15C5 (n = 0 and 8) where n following the letter F represents the number of outer perfluorinated methylenic units of the dodecyl group] with 4\xe2\x80\x98-hydroxymethyl(benzo-15-crown-5) (B15C5) and 1-hydroxymethyl(15-crown-5) (15C5) are described. All building blocks self-assemble into supramolecular cylindrical or rod-like dendrimers via ion-mediated complexation processes. These rod-like supermolecules form a thermotropic hexagonal columnar (\xce\xa6h) liquid crystalline (LC) phase. The fluorination of the dodecyl groups of these tapered building blocks enhances dramatically their self-assembly ability. The building blocks based on n = 6 and 8 self-assemble into supramolecular columns solely via the fluorophobic effect. Direct structural characterization of the supramolecular columns obtained via these two molecular recognition processes by a combination of techniques consisting of differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and thermal optical polarized microscopy, and of the columns obtained solely via the fluorophobic effect allowed the construction of molecular models for the supramolecular columns obtained via these two organizing forces. An increase in the column diameter with increasing n and with the complexation of metal salts (i.e., alkali metal trifluoromethanesulfonates) accounts for a structural model in which the uncomplexed and complexed crown ethers are placed side-by-side in the center of the column with the melted tapered side groups radiating toward its periphery. The perfluorinated segments of the building blocks are microsegregated from the perhydrogenated and aromatic segments of the column. The supramolecular columns obtained from building blocks with n = 8 align homeotropically in the \xce\xa6h LC phase on untreated glass slides, i.e., form single crystal liquid crystals in which the long axes of their columns are perpendicular to the glass surface. Both the self-assembly of supramolecular columns induced solely by the fluorophobic effect and the homeotropic alignment of these columns in their \xce\xa6h LC phase open extremely interesting new synthetic and technologic opportunities in the area of self-assembly of well-defined supramolecular architectures obtained from monodendrons and other building blocks.

"Adenosine 3\xe2\x80\x98-O(PO2-)OCH2R phosphate esters have been synthesized with R = 8-hydroxyquinol-2-yl (1a) and 8-(hydroxyquinolyl)-2-methylene (1b). The adenosine 3\xe2\x80\x98-O(PO2-)OCH2R structure has the essential features of an RNA dinucleotide. Equilibrium binding studies with metal ions Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and La3+ have been carried out with 1a, 1b, HOCH2R (7a and 7b), and 8-hydroxyquinoline (8), and equilibrium constants (Kas) have been determined for the formation of 1:1 (L)Mn+ complexes. The hydrolysis of 1a and 1b as well as (1a)Mn+ and (1b)Mn+ species are first order in HO-. The rate enhancement for hydrolysis of 1a by complexation with metal ions is as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 \xe2\x88\xbc105 with Zn2+, \xe2\x88\xbc103 with Mg2+, \xe2\x88\xbc105 with Cu2+, and \xe2\x88\xbc109 with La3+. Molecular modeling indicates that metal ions ligated to the 8-hydroxyquinoline moiety in the complexes (1a)Mn+ and (1b)Mn+ catalyze 1a and 1b hydrolysis by interacting as Lewis acid catalysts with the negatively charged oxygen atom of the phosphate group. In the instance of La3+ complexes, the ligated metal ion is within an interactive distance with both the negative phosphate oxygen and the leaving oxygen. This bimodal assistance by La3+ to the displacement reaction at phosphorus by the 2\xe2\x80\x98-hydroxyl anion results in remarkable rate accelerations for the hydrolysis of (1a)La3+ and (1b)La3+ complexes. The complexes (1a)Mn+ and (1b)Mn+ are themselves hydrolyzed by metal ion catalysis in a reaction that is first order in HO-, an observation consistent with a transition state composition of [(1a,b)Mn+][Mn+][HO-]. We assume the kinetic equivalent [(1a,b)Mn+][Mn+OH] to represent the reacting species. In this catalysis the Mn+OH is proposed to play the role of general base to deprotonate the 2\xe2\x80\x98-OH while the metal in the complexes (1a,b)Mn+ is coordinated to a negative oxygen of the \xe2\x88\x92(PO2-)\xe2\x88\x92 moiety. This double metal ion catalysis mimics a mechanism proposed for the ribozyme self-cleavage of RNA. "
"The first enantioselective synthesis of the known (+)-conessine precursor (+)-benzohydrindan 23 from the chiral nonracemic bicyclic lactam 1 is described. The key transformation was the highly diastereoselective (3 + 2) cycloaddition of azomethine ylide 11a to lactam 7 in order to construct the pyrrolidine E ring system at any early stage in the synthesis. The requisite pyrrolidine methyl group at C-21 was stereoselectively installed late in the synthesis by lithiation of N-Boc-pyrrolidine intermediate 20 with sec-BuLi/TMEDA followed by quenching at \xe2\x88\x9290 \xc2\xb0C with iodomethane, furnishing the tetracyclic pyrrolidine 21. Reduction of t-Boc 21 with lithium aluminum hydride affords (+)-N-methyl tetracycle 23 in a concise 13-step synthesis from 1. "
"A novel and practical total synthesis of a tricyclic \xce\xb2-lactam antibiotic, GV104326 (4-methoxytrinem or Sanfetrinem) has been achieved in nine steps and about 33% overall yield from a commercially available acetoxyazetidinone chiron. A key step in the highly diastereoselective synthesis is a protonation of a zinc enolate complex which circumvents the use of enantiomerically pure (S)-2-methoxycyclohexanone. A mechanistic rationale is presented and experimentally verified. "
"The recently discovered [2Fe\xe2\x88\x922S] cluster in mouse liver ferrochelatase has been characterized using UV\xe2\x88\x92vis, EPR, and M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectroscopic techniques. Studies are reported here for the recombinant protein purified from an overproducing transformed Escherichia coli strain. A positive correlation is observed between the presence of the [2Fe\xe2\x88\x922S] cluster and the enzymatic specific activity and demonstrates the necessity of this cofactor. Chemical analysis revealed that the preparations contained up to 1.3 Fe/molecule and indicated a 1:1 stoichiometry between Fe and acid\xe2\x88\x92labile sulfide. The [2Fe\xe2\x88\x922S] cluster in the as-isolated ferrochelatase exhibits a UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectrum indicative of a [2Fe\xe2\x88\x922S]2+ cluster and is EPR-silent. The 8 T M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectrum of the 57Fe-enriched as-isolated protein is well simulated by parameters \xce\x94EQ = 0.69 \xc2\xb1 0.03 mm/s and \xce\xb4 = 0.28 \xc2\xb1 0.02 mm/s and confirms the presence of a diamagnetic ground state. Upon reduction with sodium dithionite, ferrochelatase shows a near-axial EPR spectrum with g-values of 2.00, 1.93, and 1.91, consistent with a S = 1/2 mixed valent Fe3+\xe2\x88\x92Fe2+ cluster. The Orbach temperature dependence of the EPR line widths was used to provide an estimate of the exchange coupling J, which was determined to be on the order of 500\xe2\x88\x92650 cm-1 (+JS1\xc2\xb7S2 model). Redox titrations monitored by UV\xe2\x88\x92vis and EPR spectroscopy revealed midpoint potentials of \xe2\x88\x92390 \xc2\xb1 10 and \xe2\x88\x92405 \xc2\xb1 10 mV, respectively. M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectra of the sodium dithionite-reduced 57Fe-enriched ferrochelatase collected at 4.2 K in the presence of magnetic fields of 60 mT and 8 T strengths were analyzed in the mixed-valent S = 1/2 ground state. Parameters for the ferric site are \xce\x94EQ = 1.2 \xc2\xb1 0.2 mm/s and \xce\xb4 = 0.28 \xc2\xb1 0.03 mm/s, with somewhat anisotropic hyperfine splittings; for the ferrous site, \xce\x94EQ = 3.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1 mm/s and \xce\xb4 = 0.67 \xc2\xb1 0.04 mm/s with anisotropic hyperfine splittings characteristic of high-spin ferrous ion. The similarities and differences with other characterized [2Fe\xe2\x88\x922S]+ cluster-containing proteins are discussed. "
"Methylrhenium trioxide (CH3ReO3 or MTO) catalyzes several classes of reactions of ethyl diazoacetate, EDA. It is the first high valent oxo complex for carbene transfer. Under mild conditions and in the absence of other substrates, EDA was converted to a 9:1 mixture of diethyl maleate and diethyl fumarate. In the presence of alcohols, \xce\xb1-alkoxy ethyl acetates were obtained in good yield. The yields dropped for the larger and more branched alcohols, the balance of material being diethyl maleate and fumarate. An electron-donating group in the para position of phenols favors the formation of \xce\xb1-phenoxy ethyl acetates. The use of EDA to form \xce\xb1-thio ethyl acetates and N-substituted glycine ethyl esters, on the other hand, is hardly affected by the size or structure of the parent thiol or amine, with all of these reactions proceeding in high yield. MTO-catalyzed cycloaddition reactions occur between EDA and aromatic imines, olefins, and carbonyl compounds. Three-membered ring products are formed:\xe2\x80\x89 aziridines, cyclopropanes, and epoxides, respectively. The reactions favor the formation of trans products, and provide a convenient route for the preparation of aziridines. Intermediate carbenoid and nitrenoid species have been proposed. In the presence of an oxygen source such as an epoxide, ethyl diazoacetate and azibenzil are converted to an oxalic acid monoethyl ester and to benzil; at the same time the epoxide was converted to an olefin. These results provide further support for the proposed intermediate, a cyclic species containing Re, O, and CHCO2Et (or, occasionally, CPhC(O)Ph) in a three-membered ring. "
"A theoretical evaluation of tetra-tert-butylethylene (1) at the BLYP/DZd level confirms that it should be a stable molecule with a singlet ground state. The synthesis of 1 from two molecules of di-tert-butylcarbene (6) is unlikely. Although the formation of singlet 1 from the triplet 3B ground state of 6 (singlet 6 is only 1\xe2\x88\x923 kcal/mol higher in energy) is highly exothermic (\xce\x94H = \xe2\x88\x9273.7 kcal/mol), the barrier \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 25 kcal/mol (298 K, 1 atm, BLYP/DZd) for the dimerization is too large to compete with the barrier for intramolecular carbene insertion. The barrier for singlet 6 to yield 1,1-dimethyl-2-tert-butylcyclopropane (12) is only 5 kcal/mol. The CC double bond in singlet 1 is twisted by 45\xc2\xb0, and the strain energy is \xe2\x88\xbc93 kcal/mol in agreement with molecular mechanics results. Triplet 1 has a nearly perfectly perpendicular conformation at the central CC bond (87\xc2\xb0 torsional angle), but it is still strained by 42 kcal/mol and is 12 kcal/mol higher in energy than singlet 1. Alkyl substitution decreases the S\xe2\x88\x92T separation of carbenes due to the greater hyperconjugative stabilization of the singlet than the triplet. "
"Ab initio calculations at the second-order M\xcf\x86ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) level have been performed on the cis and trans isomers of the title model complex. For the cis isomer, the optimized structure shows a H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Si interaction distance of 1.813 \xc3\x85, in close agreement with the experimental value of 1.769 \xc3\x85 for cis-Mo(CO)(depe)2(H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7SiHPh2). Analysis of the density Laplacian (\xe2\x88\x872\xcf\x81) around the Mo\xe2\x88\x92(H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Si) triangle reveals a predominantly covalent Mo\xe2\x88\x92Si bond and a likely dative H-\xe2\x86\x92Mo bond, with a heavily curved H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Si bond path, suggesting that the H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Si covalent interaction is severely weakened. The trans structure is 9.9 kcal/mol less stable than the cis isomer, caused by the competition of metal d-electrons between CO and H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Si, and is manifested by the shorter H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Si distance of 1.715 \xc3\x85. The inability to locate a stable 7-coordinate structure with a H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Si distance greater than 2.5 \xc3\x85 suggests that a classical\xe2\x88\x92nonclassical tautomerism analogous to that in some dihydrogen complexes seems not very likely, and the optimized structure for a pentagonal bipyramidal 7-coordinate isomer with H and Si not neighboring is 6.5 kcal/mol less stable than the observed cis isomer. Study of the rotation of the H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Si unit around the Mo\xe2\x88\x92(H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Si) \xe2\x80\x9cbond\xe2\x80\x9d gives a rotation barrier of about 10 kcal/mol caused by the competition of Mo d-electrons for back-bonding similar to that for the trans isomer. On the basis of molecular orbital arguments, both the Mo complex and the widely studied piano-stool complexes Mn(Cp)(CO)2(H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7SiR3) can be regarded as pseudooctahedral d6-ML6 which is a particularly stable class of complexes. The difference of the nature of bonding between H\xe2\x88\x92H and H\xe2\x88\x92Si complexes is also discussed in terms of orbital interaction. "
"A direct trajectory method was employed to investigate the intramolecular dynamics and unimolecular decay of the trimethylene biradical over a range of energies. This method proved to be computationally viable when the internuclear forces were determined by semiempirical molecular orbital theory. The trimethylene decay is double exponential at low energies, but becomes single exponential with a statistical rate constant as the energy is increased. The non-statistical behavior at low energies arises from incomplete intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR). The simulated results are in good agreement with the available experimental data. "
"The potential energy surface corresponding to the reaction of the cobalt cation with ethane, which represents a prototype of the activation of C\xe2\x88\x92C and C\xe2\x88\x92H bonds in alkanes by transition metal cations, has been investigated by employing the recently suggested density functional theory/Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock hybrid method B3LYP combined with reasonably large one-particle basis sets. The quality of this approach has been calibrated against experimentally known Co\xe2\x88\x92R+ binding energies of possible exit channels and against CCSD(T) energy calculations. The performance of the chosen model is satisyfing with respect to the description of relative energies, although some nonuniform deviations between calculated and experimental data have been found for absolute binding energies. The calculated barriers for the initial insertion steps of Co+ into C\xe2\x88\x92C and C\xe2\x88\x92H bonds are undoubtedly found to be considerably less energy demanding than the activation barriers connected with the reductive elimination of H2 and CH4, respectively. The rate determining step for the C\xe2\x88\x92C activation branch is a 1,3-H shift leading to a complex between Co(CH2)+ and methane. Along the C\xe2\x88\x92H activation reaction coordinate, a concerted saddle point connecting the C\xe2\x88\x92H inserted species directly with a complex of Co+ with molecular hydrogen and ethylene has been identified as the energetic bottleneck. Despite of being often proposed, no inserted dihydrido species could be located. "
"The potential-energy surface of the triatomic cation [Cr,O2]+ has been examined by means of ion-cyclotron resonance and sector-field mass spectrometry as well as high-level theoretical methods. Chromium(V) dioxide cation OCrO+ can be generated by electron ionization of CrO2Cl2 and exhibits a doublet ground state. The experimentally determined IE(CrO2) of 9.7 \xc2\xb1 0.2 eV leads to \xce\x94Hf(OCrO+) = 209 \xc2\xb1 12 kcal/mol which compares well with a theoretical prediction of 217 kcal/mol. The high-valent chromium(V) dioxide OCrO+ slowly reacts with H2 to form CrO+ and H2O as products. Activation of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, including methane and benzene, is much more efficient and involves C\xe2\x88\x92H as well as C-C bond activation. In the reaction of OCrO+ with CH4 the by-product OCr(OCH2)+ points to the operation of a stepwise mechanism in that initially a single oxo unit in OCrO+ is activated in terms of a [2 + 2] cycloaddition of methane across the Cr\xe2\x88\x92O double bond. A structurally different [Cr,O2]+ cation can be generated by chemical ionization of a mixture of Cr(CO)6 and O2. The experimental findings together with the computations propose that the ions formed consist of a mixture of doublet and quartet states of the dioxide OCrO+ and the dioxygen complex Cr(O2)+ (6A\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98); in the latter the dioxygen unit is end-on coordinated to the metal. Due to spin conservation, the direct formation of the doublet ground state OCrO+ (2A1) from the ground state reactants Cr+ (6S) and O2 (3\xce\xa3g-) is not possible; rather, two curve crossings from the sextet via the quartet to the doublet surface in the sequence 6Cr+ + 3O2 \xe2\x86\x92 6Cr(O2)+ \xe2\x86\x92 4OCrO+ \xe2\x86\x92 2OCrO+ are suggested.

"The interaction of acetic acid and acetaldehyde with preoxidized Ag{111} has been studied using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy. A bidentate bridging acetate species which shows no coverage-dependent orientation can be formed either by direct deprotonation of acetic acid by surface atomic O at 240 K or via O-induced polymerization of acetaldehyde at 140 K, followed by decomposition of the polyacetaldehyde intermediate into ethane-1,1-dioxy fragments that dehydrogenate at 220 K. A symmetry analysis reveals that the vibrational spectra of polyacetaldehyde and paraformaldehyde on many metal surfaces can be best interpreted in terms of helical chain structures bound to the surface by skeletal O atoms located along various points of the polymer backbones. "
"The gas-phase reactivity of the fluorinated hydrocarbons CF4, CHF3, CH3F, C2F6, 1,1-C2H4F2, and C6F6 with the lanthanide cations Ce+, Pr+, Sm+, Ho+, Tm+, and Yb+ and the reactivity of C6H5F with all lanthanide cations Ln+ (Ln = La\xe2\x88\x92Lu, with the exception of Pm+) have been examined by Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The perfluorinated compounds tetrafluoromethane and hexafluoroethane as well as trifluoromethane do not react with any lanthanide cation. Selective activation of the strong C\xe2\x88\x92F bonds in fluoromethane, 1,1-difluoroethane, hexafluorobenzene, and fluorobenzene appears as a general reaction scheme along the 4f row. Experimental evidence is given for a \xe2\x80\x9charpoon\xe2\x80\x9d-like mechanism for the F atom abstraction process which operates via an initial electron transfer from the lanthanide cation to the fluorinated substrate in the encounter complex Ln+RF. The most reactive lanthanides La+, Ce+, Gd+, and Tb+ and also the formal closed-shell species Lu+ exhibit additional C\xe2\x88\x92H and C\xe2\x88\x92C bond activation pathways in the reaction with fluorobenzene, namely dehydrohalogenation as well as loss of a neutral acetylene molecule. In the case of Tm+ and Yb+ the formation of neutral LnF3 is observed in a multistep process via C\xe2\x88\x92C coupling and charge transfer. "
"The second-order nonlinear optical response of amine and phenol/ether derivatives (1\xe2\x88\x928) has been evaluated using experimental and theoretical techniques. Electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation (EFISH) measurements establish that N-phenyl substitution of 4-nitroaniline (1) produces a greater increase in molecular hyperpolarizability than N-methyl substitution. In contrast, O-phenyl substitution of 4-nitrophenol (6) produces a smaller increase in hyperpolarizability than O-methyl substitution. Neither the enhancement of hyperpolarizability upon N-phenyl substitution nor the differential substituent effect is anticipated on the basis of qualitative arguments. Careful theoretical analysis using semiempirical sum-over-states and finite field calculations provide explanations for both observed effects. "
"Phase transitions in poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) covalently labeled with a 2-naphthol were examined by steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy. 2-Naphthol undergoes excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) at a rate that is dependent upon water concentration in aqueous solvent systems. Upon conversion to the phase-separated state in naphthol-labeled PNIPAM, the efficiency of excited-state proton transfer diminished, consistent with formation of a globular phase in which exposure of the probe molecules to the water phase was reduced. "
"A series of short peptides derived from the basic region of the basic leucine zipper protein GCN4 were synthesized to study the cooperative DNA binding to direct repeat sequences. A modified lysine residue bearing an adamantyl group at the \xce\xb5-amino group was incorporated at the N-terminal position, and \xce\xb2-cyclodextrin was attached at the C-terminal cysteine residue of the parent basic region peptide. The resulting peptide G2AdCd possesses both host and guest molecules in the same peptide chain. DNA binding of the G2AdCd peptides to the single-, double-, and triple-direct-repeat sequences of the CRE half-site was compared by titration of the gel shift. The G2AdCd peptide did not bind the single CRE half-site, although a peptide lacking the \xce\xb2-cyclodextrin group formed a specific monomer\xe2\x88\x92half-site complex. G2AdCd bound the double-direct-repeat sequence as a dimer in a cooperative manner. Moreover, cooperative formation of a 3:1 G2AdCd\xe2\x88\x92DNA complex was observed for a triple-direct-repeat sequence. No monomer\xe2\x88\x92DNA complex of G2AdCd was observed for the double- or triple-direct-repeat sequence. In the absence of DNA, G2AdCd forms an intramolecular host\xe2\x88\x92guest complex. Formation of this cyclic peptide reduces the affinity of monomeric G2AdCd. The highly selective binding of G2AdCd observed here was accomplished by (i) its cooperative nature of DNA binding and (ii) destabilization of its nonspecific DNA binding complex. "
"We describe a general method for the preparation of cyclic peptides by intramolecular thiazolidine formation from linear, unprotected peptide precursors. The precursors contain a protected 1,2-aminothiol from an N-terminal cysteine and a 1,2-amino alcohol or 1,2-diol as a masked aldehyde. Thiazolidine formation was effected by oxidation of the 1,2-amino alcohol or 1,2-diol by sodium periodate to give an aldehyde, followed by deprotection of the masked 1,2-aminothiol. The cyclization could be effected at concentrations as high as 20 mM and was free from any polymerized side products. Such high efficiency of macrocyclization may be attributed to the ring-chain\xe2\x80\x9d tautomerism of the open chain amino-aldehyde precursor that favors a macrocyclic thiazolidine ring. Thiazolidine formation was further exploited as a capture device to position the N and C termini covalently close together and then to allow a proximity-driven O to N acyl transfer through a novel tricyclic ring contraction to yield an all amide, end-to-end cyclic lactam. These macrocyclization methods have been applied to the synthesis of cyclic peptides containing 5 to 26 amino acids. "
"The mechanism of UV-induced cleavage of duplex DNA containing 5-bromodeoxyuridine under anaerobic conditions was investigated via product analysis and kinetic isotope effect measurements using gel electrophoresis. KIEs strongly suggest that strand breaks result from abstraction of the C2\xe2\x80\x98 hydrogen atom from the 5\xe2\x80\x98-adjacent nucleotide by deoxyuridin-5-yl (1). It is proposed that under anaerobic conditions the C2\xe2\x80\x98 radical is subsequently oxidized by the cation radical of adenine. The resulting carbocation undergoes 1,2-hydride migrations from C1\xe2\x80\x98 and C3\xe2\x80\x98 competitively, giving rise to cleavage products containing 3\xe2\x80\x98-phosphate and the novel, labile 3\xe2\x80\x98-ketone (4). The identity of the latter product is supported by electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of the crude photolysate. The results also suggest that the formation of alkaline labile lesions proceed via hydrogen atom abstraction from the C2\xe2\x80\x98 position by 1. "
"As a model for the direct effect of ionizing radiation, time-resolved changes of light-scattering intensity (LSI) of aqueous, oxic solutions of single-stranded DNA samples (calf thymus, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Clostridium perfingens), polyC, polyU, and polyA at pH 7.5\xe2\x88\x928 have been studied following pulse irradiation with 193-nm laser light. A comparison of LSI changes (an index of single-strand break formation) with transient optical absorption changes (an index of nucleic acid base radical chemistry) following pulsed 193-nm irradiation shows that strand breakage occurs at rates similar to those for the decay of the nucleic acid base radical species for DNA, polyC, and polyU but not for polyA. With the exception of polyA, 193-nm light leads to a reduction in the LSI over \xe2\x88\xbc0.2 s, indicating that strand breakage occurs by a nucleobase radical-mediated process, whereby the nucleobase radical site is transferred to the sugar moiety. With polyU and polyC, significant changes in LSI also occur on a much faster time scale, (within 3 ms). In DNA, the one electron oxidized sites become localized predominantly at guanine and the resulting one electron oxidised guanine radicals lead to strand breakage in competition with major, non-strand-breakage pathways. "
"Germacrene A (3) has been proposed to be an intermediate in the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (1) to the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (+)-aristolochene (2). Under normal circumstances, however, neither 3 nor any other intermediate is released from the cyclase active site. When the anomalous substrate (7R)-6,7-dihydrofarnesyl diphosphate (5) is incubated with aristolochene synthase from Aspergillus terreus, the resultant dihydrogermacrene (6) cannot be further cyclized and is released from the active site. The structure of the abortive cyclization product, m/z 206, was confirmed as dihydrogermacrene (6) by direct GC\xe2\x88\x92MS comparison with an authentic synthetic sample prepared from (\xe2\x88\x92)-(3S)-\xce\xb2-citronellol.

"The monoalkylation and cross-linking reactivities of a group of four structurally related DNA\xe2\x88\x92DNA interstrand cross-linkers have been determined on restriction enzyme fragments and select oligomers. These highly potent cytotoxic DNA\xe2\x88\x92DNA cross-linkers consist of two cyclopropa[c]pyrrolo[3,4-3]indol-4(5H)-ones indoles [(+)-CPI-I] joined by a urea (Bizelesin) or a bisamido furan, bisamido pyrrole, or bisamido N-methylpyrrole linker. Using a thermal cleavage assay in combination with radio-labeled restriction enzyme fragments, we have shown that these compounds cross-link duplex DNA six or seven base pairs apart on opposite strands, but they differ among themselves for both alkylation reactivity and DNA sequence selectivity. Bizelesin and the [(+)-CPI-I]2 bisamido furan and [(+)-CPI-I]2 bisamido N-methyl pyrrole compounds prefer purely AT-rich sequences (e.g., 5\xe2\x80\x98-T(A/T)4 or 5A*-3\xe2\x80\x98, where T represents the cross-strand adenine alkylation and A* represents an adenine alkylation), while the [(+)-CPI-I]2 bisamido pyrrole requires a centrally positioned GC base pair for high cross-linking reactivity (i.e., 5\xe2\x80\x98-T(A/T)2G(A/T)2A*-3\xe2\x80\x98). By comparison of the cross-linking reactivity of the four compounds in 21-mer duplex oligomers containing strategically placed GC or IC base pairs, the sequence and linker requirements for high reactivity of the six- and seven-base-pair cross-linkers in 5\xe2\x80\x98-T(N)4 or 5A*-3\xe2\x80\x98 sequences were determined. In the duplex, to attain highest reactivity, a centrally placed GC base pair and the exocyclic 2-amino group were required, while for the linker in the bisamido pyrrole compound, an unsubstituted amine in the pyrrole ring was necessary. On the basis of the known requirements for monoalkylation of duplex DNA by (+)-CPI-derived compounds and the structural consequences of monoalkylation, together with the information gleaned from this study, we are able to provide a rationale for the structural requirements for the specific sequence cross-linked with high reactivity by the pyrrole compound. We propose that, because monoalkylation of the duplex produced a bent DNA duplex that is unsuitable for cross-linking, the duplex has to first undergo a ligand-induced rearrangement involving two hydrogen-bonding donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor pairs, which reinstates the requirements necessary for the second alkylation reaction. "
"As expected, Bizelesin, which is a biscyclopropa[c]pyrrolo[3,2-e]indol-4(5H)-one [(+)-CPI]-derived DNA\xe2\x88\x92DNA cross-linker, has a high interstrand cross-linking reactivity with the palindromic sequence 5\xe2\x80\x98-d(CGTAATT\xc8\xa6CG)2 (\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89\xcb\x99 and \xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89 indicate (+)-CPI alkylation sites at adenines on the same and opposite strands, respectively). Contrary to expectations, the target duplex is rearranged to yield two products:\xe2\x80\x89 one (major product) contains an AT step wherein both adenines are syn-oriented and hydrogen bonded to thymines forming a stable Hoogsteen base-paired region flanked by Watson\xe2\x88\x92Crick base-paired regions (5HG); the other (minor product) contains anti-oriented AT-step adenines that show no evidence of hydrogen bonding with pairing thymines (5OP) in an otherwise normally base-paired duplex. In another unexpected outcome, the reaction of two \xe2\x80\x9cuncoupled\xe2\x80\x9d monoalkylating (+)-CPI \xe2\x80\x9chalves\xe2\x80\x9d of Bizelesin with the same duplex alkylates same-strand adenines three base pairs apart [5\xe2\x80\x98-d(CGTA\xc8\xa6TT\xc8\xa6CG)2] rather than the anticipated opposite-strand adenines six base pairs apart (which would mimic Bizelesin). To probe the molecular mechanism that leads to Bizelesin\'s unusual DNA rearrangement, which appears to be a requirement for DNA\xe2\x88\x92DNA interstrand cross-linking, we have carried out conformational exchange analyses (NOESY and ROESY) and restrained molecular dynamics simulations of these adducts. These studies suggest that Bizelesin controls the rearrangement of the six-base-pair target prior to cross-linkage and restricts the cross-linked DNA adduct\'s range of motion, freezing-out adduct conformers defined by alternative drug\xe2\x88\x92DNA hydrogen-bond regimes. The two competing cross-linkage pathways share a common first step, the opening of the central AT-step base pairs, an event that is facilitated by the energetics of monoadduct-induced DNA bending distortion. One pathway (to 5HG) stabilizes these open bases by reorganizing the AT-step region into two Hoogsteen base pairs, the thymine bases of which also hydrogen bond with Bizelesin\'s ureadiyl subunit. A second pathway (to 5OP) directly stabilizes the open bases by forming a hydrogen-bonding complex between the AT-step thymines and Bizelesin\'s ureadiyl subunit. Cross-linked DNA motion drives both of the 5HG and 5OP adducts from one ephemeral hydrogen-bonding regime to another, a process documented in the NOESY conformational exchange data and simulated in restrained molecular dynamics trajectories. These results, together with the analysis of other six-base-pair Bizelesin cross-linked species, suggest a novel mechanism for sequence recognition by this cross-linker where monoalkylation distortive stress associated with a bent DNA conformation must be dissipated by a cooperative interaction between drug and duplex to produce a straight B-form-like structure before cross-linking can proceed. This example provides a new mechanism for DNA sequence recognition involving a \xe2\x80\x9cdrug-induced rearrangement\xe2\x80\x9d of DNA that critically depends upon the interplay of drug and sequence recognition elements.

"A novel deoxynucleoside, 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxy-7-(hydroxymethyl)-7-deazaadenosine, was synthesized with the intent of using the analogue to mimic the role of \xe2\x80\x9cstructural\xe2\x80\x9d waters in the major groove of DNA. The target compound was synthesized in four steps starting from 2-((ethoxymethylene)amino)-5-bromo-1-(2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxy-3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-di-O-p-toluoyl-\xce\xb2-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)pyrrole-3,4-dicarbonitrile. The structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction and proton NMR spectroscopic analyses. The crystal structure shows an intramolecular hydrogen bond between an amino proton on N6 and the oxygen of the hydroxymethyl group. When superimposed onto particular adenines in the structure of the tryptophan (trp) repressor/operator complex, the analogue places the oxygen of the hydroxymethyl group very near the oxygen contributed by the water in the protein/DNA complex. This analogue may be useful for probing the role of structural waters in other specific protein/DNA complexes and in DNA bending. "
"Treatment of the manganese acetyl (CO)5MnC(O)CH3 (1) with 1\xe2\x88\x922 equiv of a monohydrosilane furnished mixtures of \xce\xb1-siloxyethyl (CO)5MnCH(OSiR3)CH3 (2) and \xce\xb1-siloxyvinyl (CO)5MnC(OSiR3)CH2 (3) complexes. Relative yields of 2 and 3 varied from 80% and 6% for HSiMe2Ph to 28% and 59% for HSiEt3. One of the latter compounds, (CO)5MnC(OSiEt3)CH2 (3j), was fully characterized, and seven examples of 2 were isolated in moderate yields. Four \xce\xb1-siloxyethyl complexes 2 were further characterized as stable derivatives (CO)5MnC(O)CH(OSiR3)CH3 after carbonylation. Mechanistic studies on the HSiMe2Ph and HSiEt3 hydrosilation of 1 are noteworthy for (1) the absence of (R3SiO)CHCH2 and CH3CH2OSiR3 byproducts, (2) the presence of 3 but not (CO)5MnSiR3, (3) inhibition by CO, phosphine, or acetonitrile, but neither air nor light, (4) competitive hydrosilation of other substrates (e.g., acetone or Cp(CO)2FeC(O)R) for which 1 is a precatalyst, (5) degradation of 2 by excess HSiR3, giving Mn2(CO)10 and (R3Si)2O as the final products, (6) the fact that this degradation results in autocatalysis by generating the transient active catalyst (CO)4MnSiR3 (15), and (7) the fact that the hydrosilation induction period can be removed by independently generating the putative 15. These observations are consistent with an autocatalytic hydrosilation mechanism in which silane degradation of product 2 (or of other manganese complexes) generates the active catalyst 15, which binds 1 and rearranges to the unsaturated bimetallic \xce\xbc-siloxyethylidene (CO)5MnC(CH3)(OSiMe2Ph)Mn(CO)4 as the key catalysis intermediate:\xe2\x80\x89 silane addition affords 2 whereas \xce\xb2-deinsertion produces 3.

"The synthesis of 2(3),9(10),16(17),23(24)-tetrasubstituted phthalocyanines from 1,2-dicyano-4-alkoxybenzenes or the corresponding isoindolines is reported. In each case, four isomers with D2h, C4h, C2v, and Cs symmetry are obtained in the statistical expected yield. The separation of the C4h and the D2h isomers was achieved successfully for the first time from the other two isomers with newly developed HPLC phases based on \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interactions. In one case, phthalocyanine 12 could be separated into the isomers 12a\xe2\x88\x92d and characterized by UV/vis and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Due to line broadening at room temperature, T1 and T2 relaxation time measurements of two phthalocyanines (3 and 12) at different temperatures are carried out. Whether the broad peaks are due to aggregation or due to a short relaxation time is explained. "
"The factors that influence the stereocontrol of trimethylenemethane (TMM) cycloadditions are examined in the context of a synthesis of a perhydroazulene. The diastereofacial selectivity with respect to the acceptor is established in an intramolecular [3 + 2] reaction with a five-carbon tether. When a doubly activated acceptor is utilized, complete selectivity is observed wherein the Z-situated activating group is proposed as a diastereoselectivity control element. Further, the use of trimethylstannyl acetate as a cocatalyst for cycloadditions to electron deficient alkenes is illustrated for the first time. A one-pot, three-component coupling protocol provides a facile new entry into acyl-substituted TMM precursors specifically and \xce\xb1-hydroxy ketones more generally. The methodology led to a total synthesis of (\xe2\x88\x92)-isoclavukerin A. The shortest version of the synthesis involves eleven steps from methallyl alcohol. "
"A pair of conformationally restricted TRH analogs have been synthesized. Both analogs have the central histidine of TRH replaced by a cyclohexylalanine unit, and both analogs contain a 6,5-bicyclic lactam ring fusing the proline peptide bond into a trans conformation. The analogs differ at the bridgehead stereocenter. The synthesis of the analogs utilized an anodic amide oxidation reaction to selectively functionalize a proline derivative and a titanium tetrachloride-initiated cyclization\xe2\x88\x92rearrangement sequence to assemble the desired bicyclic ring skeleton. The analogs were compared with the unrestricted cyclohexyalanine-containing TRH analog (cyclohexyl-Ala2-TRH) in order to determine how the added lactam ring affected the affinity and the potency of the analog for TRH-R. Both the affinity and potency of the restricted analogs were found to be critically dependent on the bridgehead stereochemistry of the bicyclic ring. The analog having R stereochemistry at the bridgehead was 478 times more potent than the S isomer. In addition, the R isomer was found to be approximately 4.7 times more potent than its unrestricted counterpart. Similarly, the R isomer was found to have an affinity for TRH-R that was approximately 3.4 times the affinity of the unrestricted cyclohexyl-Ala2-TRH. "
"The photochemistry of N-hydroxypyridine-2(1H)-thione (N-HPT) has been investigated in aqueous and organic solvents using laser flash photolysis (\xce\xbbexc = 308 or 355 nm). Independent of the environment, UV excitation of N-HPT causes homolytic N\xe2\x88\x92O bond cleavage, which leads to formation of the 2-pyridylthiyl (PyS\xe2\x80\xa2) and hydroxyl (\xe2\x80\xa2OH) radicals. In aqueous media, this process occurs efficiently from both the anionic and neutral forms (\xce\xa6N-O \xe2\x89\x88 0.20\xe2\x88\x920.30). In addition to N\xe2\x88\x92O bond scission, N-HPT undergoes other primary photoprocesses which are pH-dependent. At pH = 7, photoionization (\xce\xa6e\xe2\x88\x92 = 0.09 (\xce\xbbexc = 308 nm) and 0.05 (\xce\xbbexc = 355 nm)) of the anionic form generates the hydrated electron as well as the semioxidized radical of N-HPT. Fast rearrangement of the latter species produces the N-oxy-2-pyridylthiyl radical. At pH = 2, where the uncharged structure predominates, formation of an excited triplet state (ET \xe2\x89\xa5 59.5 kcal mol-1) is observed (\xce\xa6T \xe2\x89\xa5 0.05 using \xce\xbbexc = 355 nm) but photoionization does not take place. The neutral form of N-HPT displays similar photochemical behavior in organic solvents, generating \xe2\x80\xa2OH, PyS\xe2\x80\xa2, and the triplet state (\xce\xa6N-O = 0.30\xe2\x88\x920.45 and \xce\xa6T = 0.03\xe2\x88\x920.05 using \xce\xbbexc = 355 nm). In nonpolar, aprotic media, the subsequent reaction of PyS\xe2\x80\xa2 with the thiol tautomer of N-HPT leads to the formation of an unsymmetric disulfide radical. Reactivities of the different transient species toward potential scavengers have also been investigated. The results obtained show that the simultaneous generation of several highly reactive intermediates is a major drawback in the use of N-HPT as a clean and simple photolytic source of \xe2\x80\xa2OH. "
"The primary and subsequent photochemistry of N-hydroxy-2(1H)-pyridone (N-HP) has been investigated in aqueous and nonaqueous media by laser flash photolysis (\xce\xbbexc = 308 nm). In organic solvents, as well as in buffers at pH \xe2\x89\xa4 7, the initial photochemistry of N-HP consists of homolytic N\xe2\x88\x92O bond cleavage leading to the formation of the 2-pyridyloxyl (PyO\xe2\x80\xa2) and hydroxyl (\xe2\x80\xa2OH) radicals, the quantum yield (\xce\xa6N-O = \xce\xa6\xe2\x80\xa2OH) varying from 0.25 to 0.6, depending on the solvent. Quenching experiments have demonstrated that PyO\xe2\x80\xa2 is relatively unreactive and is removed mainly via a bimolecular radical reaction. In highly basic aqueous media, N-HP exists in the anionic form and is much less photolabile. At pH = 10, in addition to a low yield of N\xe2\x88\x92O bond cleavage (\xce\xa6N-O = 0.037), N-HP undergoes photoionization, but solvated electron production was found to be very inefficient (\xce\xa6e- = 0.003). Thus, under biologically relevant conditions, N-HP has a much simpler photochemical behavior than that of the closely related N-hydroxypyridine-2(1H)-thione (N-HPT) and may be more useful as a specific generator of hydroxyl radicals in chemical and biological systems.

"In order to examine the possibilities of using the oxamate anion, [OOCCONH2]-, as a versatile building block of low-dimensional, hydrogen-bonded scaffolding, the preferential assembly patterns displayed by this anion were identified using X-ray single-crystal data for a sequence of simple oxamate salts. Several new compounds were synthesized, and the crystal structures of six materials are presented:\xe2\x80\x89 piperidinium oxamate (1), 2-amino-5-nitropyridine 2-amino-5-nitropyridinium oxamate (2), imidazolium oxamate (3), (4-chlorobenzyl)ammonium oxamate (4), (3-chlorobenzyl)ammonium oxamate (5), and potassium oxamate monohydrate (6). The oxamate anion acts as a building block of either 1-D (ribbons or ladders) or 2-D (layers) motifs. These architectures (generated by NH\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O hydrogen bonds) are the result of the selectivity of complimentary hydrogen-bond sites of the anion. However, the type of network adopted is also influenced by cation\xe2\x88\x92anion interactions, and the role of the physical\xe2\x88\x92chemical characteristics of the cation in inducing a specific anionic motif, is discussed. The oxamate anion, as well as other deprotonated carboxylic amides, may represent useful additions to the existing collection of building blocks capable of generating extended hydrogen-bonded motifs for crystal engineering.

"The free alkylidenecarbene, 2-butyl-1-hexenylidene 1 (R = Bu), generated by triethylamine-induced \xce\xb1-elimination of 2-butyl-1-hexenyliodonium tetrafluoroborate 7 in tetrahydrofuran undergoes regioselective 1,5-C-H insertions, 1,2-shifts of the butyl group, and electrophilic attack on the tertiary amine followed by protonation to give the cyclopentene 8, the alkyne 9, and the vinylammonium salt 10, respectively. In addition to these free carbene-derived products, the reaction affords the three-component coupling product, the vinyl ether 11, produced through nucleophilic attack of tetrahydrofuran on 1 (R = Bu) generating the oxonium ylide 2 (R = Bu), followed by protonation with subsequent ring-opening of the resulting cyclic oxonium salt 15 (R = Bu) by nucleophilic attack of triethylamine. Reactions were observed to be temperature dependent, as reflected in variations in the product profiles:\xe2\x80\x89 decreasing the reaction temperature tended to decrease the yields of free alkylidenecarbene-derived products, i.e., cyclopentenes, alkynes, and vinylammonium salts, and to increase those of the vinyloxonium ylide-derived products, vinyl ethers. This temperature dependence is explained in terms of reversible oxonium ylide formation. No evidence was observed to suggest the existence of an equilibrium between the free alkylidenecarbene and the sulfonium ylide in the reaction in tetrahydrothiophene. These results are consistent with quantum calculations using the MOPAC 93 program. "
"A library of neomycin B mimetics has been prepared rapidly without chromatography using a neamine-derived aldehyde, tert-butyl isocyanide or isocyanoacetic acid methyl ester, a glycine-conjugated polyethylene glycol (PEG) methyl ether, and various Cbz-N-protected amino acids as substrates in a Ugi-type one-pot reaction. The product linked to PEG was isolated by precipitation in ether. A simultaneous base-catalyzed hydrolysis and de-O-acetylation followed by hydrogenation provided an easy access to a library of neomycin B mimetics, which were screened for binding to the Rev responsive element of HIV mRNA (RRE). Several products were found to be more active than neamine with the IC50 values in the micromolar range. "
"Sugar amino acids (SAAs) were designed and synthesized as new non-peptide peptidomimetics utilizing carbohydrates as peptide building blocks. They represent sugar-like ring structures that carry an amino and a carboxylic functional group and have a specific conformational influence on the backbone of peptides due to their distinct substitution patterns in rigid pyranose sugar rings. Five different SAAs (SAA1\xce\xb1, SAA1\xce\xb2, SAA2, SAA3, and SAA4) have been synthesized that show the ability to constrain linear backbone conformations or distinct turn structures. Linear and cyclic peptides involving SAAs have been prepared in solution as well as by solid phase synthesis. SAA1\xce\xb1 and SAA2 were incorporated into two linear Leu-enkephalin analogs, replacing the natural Gly-Gly dipeptide. NMR studies provide evidence for the conformation-inducing effect of the carbohydrate moiety. SAA2 and SAA3 have been placed in cyclic hexapeptide analogs of somatostatin; SAA4 was incorporated in a model peptide. The conformation of the cyclic peptides cyclo(-SAA2-Phe-d-Trp-Lys-Thr-), cyclo(-SAA3-Phe-d-Trp-Lys(Boc)Thr(tBu)-), and cyclo(-SAA4-Ala-d-Pro-Ala-Ala-) have been analyzed by various NMR techniques in combination with distance geometry calculations and subsequent molecular dynamic simulations. The determined solution conformations were compared to representative idealized peptide backbones. SAA2 and SAA3 induce a \xce\xb2-turn structure while SAA4 mimics a \xce\xb3-turn. Both enkephalin analogs were not active in the guinea pig ileum assay. The somatostatin analog containing SAA2 has an inhibition constant (IC50) of 0.15 \xce\xbcM for the inhibition of the release of growth hormone. "
"Synthesis of the title compound 2 was accomplished in a multistep sequence starting from hypophosphorous acid. In strong base, the bicyclic phosphinate 2 hydrolyzes 2 orders of magnitude faster than the bicyclic phosphate OP(OCH2)3CCH3 (1a) and the acceleration is entirely enthalpic. This rate enhancement is attributed to the greater ease with which 2 achieves the five-coordinate transition state. The molecular structure of 2, determined by X-ray means, compared with that of 1a reveals no evidence of strain within either bicyclic framework. The observed acceleration does not support the contribution of a stereoelectronic effect in the hydrolysis of six-membered ring phosphates. "
"Three-coordinate Ti(NRAr)3 [R = C(CD3)2(CH3), Ar = C6H3Me2] was prepared in 73% yield by sodium amalgam reduction of ClTi(NRAr)3 and in 83% yield upon treatment of TiCl3(THF)3 with 3 equiv of Li(NRAr)(OEt2) in the presence of TMEDA. Ti(tBuNPh)3 was prepared similarly in 75% yield by treatment of TiCl3(THF)3 with 3 equiv of Li(tBuNPh)(OEt2) in the presence of TMEDA. Reaction of Ti(NRAr)3 with NMo(OtBu)3 in hydrocarbon solvents at \xe2\x88\x9235 \xc2\xb0C generates a thermally unstable intermediate formulated as (tBuO)3Mo[\xce\xbc-N]Ti(NRAr)3, which readily loses a tert-butyl radical and isomerizes at 25 \xc2\xb0C. Kinetics of the latter process were obtained over the temperature range 20\xe2\x88\x9260 \xc2\xb0C; the process exhibits clean first-order behavior. The following activation parameters were obtained:\xe2\x80\x89 \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 21.4 \xc2\xb1 0.2 kcal mol-1 and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x923.7 \xc2\xb1 0.6 cal mol-1 K-1. The oxo-bridged product (tBuO)2(N)Mo[\xce\xbc-O]Ti(NRAr)3 was isolated in 83% yield from this reaction. Full characterization of the latter diamagnetic complex included an X-ray crystal structure and an 15N NMR study. Ti(NRAr)3 (1 equiv) reacts further with (tBuO)2(N)Mo[\xce\xbc-O]Ti(NRAr)3 to generate a species formulated as a second paramagnetic nitrido-bridged intermediate, (tBuO)2Mo{[\xce\xbc-O]Ti(NRAr)3}{[\xce\xbc-N]Ti(NRAr)3}, which at 25 \xc2\xb0C loses a tert-butyl radical and isomerizes to give the final product, (tBuO)(N)Mo{[\xce\xbc-O]Ti(NRAr)3}2, isolated as an orange powder in 91% yield. Characterization of the latter diamagnetic complex included an 15N NMR study. Attempts to displace a third tert-butyl radical by treatment of (tBuO)(N)Mo{[\xce\xbc-O]Ti(NRAr)3}2 with Ti(NRAr)3 led to no reaction. Treatment of (tBuO)(N)Mo{[\xce\xbc-O]Ti(NRAr)3}2 with neat methyl iodide led to the isolation of (MeO)(N)Mo{[\xce\xbc-O]Ti(NRAr)3}2 in 51% yield; 13C and nitrido-15N derivatives of this species were prepared for spectroscopic characterization. O2Mo{[\xce\xbc-O]Ti(tBuNPh)3}2 was prepared in 59% yield upon treatment of MoO2(OtBu)2 with 2 equiv of Ti(tBuNPh)3 in benzene at 65 \xc2\xb0C. Full characterization of O2Mo{[\xce\xbc-O]Ti(tBuNPh)3}2 included a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study. Previously reported (iPrO)3V[\xce\xbc-O]Ti(NRAr)3 was oxidized with ferrocenium triflate to give TfOTi(NRAr)3 and OV(OiPr)3. TfOTi(NRAr)3 was prepared independently in 80% yield by treatment of Ti(NRAr)3 with ferrocenium triflate. (iPrO)3V[\xce\xbc-O]Ti(NRAr)3 is stable in the presence of methyl iodide. ITi(NRAr)3 was prepared independently by treatment of Ti(NRAr)3 with the stoichiometric amount of iodine. Paramagnetic (tBuO)3V[\xce\xbc-O]Ti(NRAr)3 was prepared as orange-brown needles in 94% yield and was found to be thermally stable. The relatively robust \xce\xbc-nitrido compound (Me2N)3Mo[\xce\xbc-N]Ti(tBuNPh)3, which was prepared in 77% isolated yield, showed no decomposition when heated in benzene at 70 \xc2\xb0C for 13 h. "
"Magnesium reduction of cis,cis,trans-RuCl2(CO)2L2 (L = PtBu2Me) yields isolable Ru(CO)2L2, shown by solution spectroscopies and X-ray diffraction to have trans phosphines but cis carbonyls, in a nonplanar structure which resembles a trigonal bipyramid with one equatorial ligand missing. This unusual geometric structure is traced by ab initio (MP2) study to enhanced back-donation to CO by zero-valent Ru. This molecule reacts in time of mixing to add CO, MeNC, O2, CS2, C2H4, or PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeCPh. Rapid oxidative addition occurs with H2, HCl, Cl2, and PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeCH. Oxidative addition is slower with MeCl, Me3SiH, and MeOH, which leads to more complicated reaction schemes. Reaction with PPh2H gives not oxidative addition but addition and displacement, yielding Ru(CO)2(PPh2H)2(PtBu2Me) and equimolar free PtBu2Me. Magnesium reduction of cis,cis,trans-RuCl2(CO)2L\xe2\x80\x982 proceeds analogously for L\xe2\x80\x98 = PiPr3, but for L\xe2\x80\x98 = PPh3, decomposition and ligand scavenging give Ru(CO)2(PPh3)3. Reduction of cis,trans-RuCl2(CO)(CNMe)L2 gives the product of oxidative addition of a tBu C\xe2\x88\x92H bond:\xe2\x80\x89 RuH(CO)(CNMe)[\xce\xb72-P(CMe2CH2)tBuMe]L, showing the influence of electron density at unsaturated Ru(0) on its persistence.

"A method has been developed which allows the simultaneous refinement of X-ray powder diffraction data and one or more EXAFS spectra from the same sample using a single set of coordinates to describe the structure. The atomic positions are refined together with isotropic thermal factors, peak shape and amplitude parameters, and the EXAFS energy zeros for each absorption edge. The program determines the point symmetry and radial coordinates of each site occupied by an atom for which EXAFS data are available, allowing a full multiple scattering calculation to be performed for each site. Mixed or partial occupancy of sites is permitted. Where correlations between atoms can be calculated, as with copper for which Debye theory can be used, EXAFS mean-square displacements can be derived from the isotropic thermal factors, otherwise either the correlations or the EXAFS mean-square relative displacements must be introduced as separate variables. The method potentially allows us to accurately determine the position of oxygen and other light atoms in materials where the diffraction pattern is dominated by heavy atoms, and to determine the occupancy of sites where elements of similar scattering amplitude are involved. Results are particularly good where the EXAFS of several absorbing atoms are available. "
"The preparation and electrochemical characterization of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of azobenzenebutanethiols 1d and ferrocenylazobenzenebutanethiols 2d on Au are reported. Adsorption of these molecules onto Au surfaces has been verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and reflectance infrared spectroscopy. Optical ellipsometry, capacitance measurements, and cyclic voltammetry indicate that azobenzene-terminated adsorbate molecules form densely packed SAMs on Au(111). Reduction of the azobenzene group in 1d or 2d in an aprotic medium results in the formation of an azobenzene radical anion. However, SAMs of 1d and 2d exhibit almost no electrochemical accessibility for their azobenzene groups, even though a SAM of 2d exhibits complete electrochemical accessibility for its outer layer of ferrocenyl groups. The azobenzene electrochemical inaccessibility is due to the densely packed structures of these SAMs and their ability to prohibit the incorporation of charge-compensating cations upon their reduction. Addition of free volume to a film of 2d by coadsorption with ethanethiol or more efficient use of the existing free volume in a full monolayer by using smaller charge-compensating cations such as H+ or Li+ results in greater azobenzene accessibility. Therefore, electron transfer processes between the electrode surface and the redox-active azobenzene centers within the film can be gated by controlling charge-compensating cation size and concentration and/or film structure. This gating behavior constitutes a supramolecular response in SAMs as it is a collective property of the film and not a property of the molecules that comprise the film. Reduction of the azobenzene in the SAM in the presence of H+ results in hydrazobenzene formation, which has been verified by Raman spectroelectrochemistry. The potential for the latter reduction is dependent upon pH. A three-case model has been proposed to describe the ion-gating behavior of a SAM of 2d. "
"Macrobicycle 12 has been synthesized and its binding properties with a range of N-acetyl amino acid carboxylates (as tetrabutylammonium salts) have been studied. While the binding results showed little selectivity for the various substrates investigated, detailed NMR studies have revealed that d-amino acid substrates bind predominantly on the outside of the macrobicycle cavity by a strong carboxylate\xe2\x88\x92thiourea interaction, whereas l-amino acid substrates bind predominantly on the inside of the cavity also establishing a strong carboxylate\xe2\x88\x92thiourea interaction but with the acetyl amide in a cis configuration. Molecular modeling studies suggest that the energetic penalty associated with adopting a cis amide configuration in the host\xe2\x88\x92guest complex is compensated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the cis amide and the rim of the macrobicycle.

"The electron spin dynamics associated with intramolecular electron transfer in a photosynthetic model system, which consists of a linear structure of the type A-B-C, is described. In this structure, donor A is a p-methoxyaniline, chromophore B is a 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide, and acceptor C is a 1,4:5,8-naphthalenediimide. This supramolecular electron donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor array was isotropically oriented in toluene, and anisotropically oriented in liquid crystal matrices, and studied by time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Photoexcitation of B results in a two-step electron transfer to yield the radical ion pair, A\xe2\x80\xa2+-B-C\xe2\x80\xa2-. Charge recombination within A\xe2\x80\xa2+-B-C\xe2\x80\xa2- produces a molecular triplet state, A-B-3*C, which exhibits the unique spin-polarized electron paramagnetic resonance signal that has been observed only in photosynthetic reaction-center proteins.

"The rates and products of the purely heterogeneous oxidations of C2H6(g) and C2H4(g) on Sm2O3 in the presence of O2(g) were investigated in a very low-pressure flow reactor by on-line molecular beam mass spectrometry, about 1000 \xc2\xb1 100 K. Ethane is oxidized to ethyl radicals, which undergo unimolecular decomposition into (C2H4 + H) or further oxidation to CO. C2H4 oxidation leads to CO as initial product, that is subsequently converted into CO2. Steady state rates are proportional to ki\xe2\x80\x98([O2]) \xc3\x97 [C2Hn], with ki\xe2\x80\x98([O2]) = ki \xc3\x97 (Ki[O2])1/2/{1+(Ki[O2])1/2} (i = 3, 4 for n = 6, 4, respectively), which is consistent with the direct oxidation of hydrocarbons on surface oxygen species in dissociative equilibrium with O2(g). Alternate or simultaneous measurement of the oxidation rates for C2H6, C2H4, and CH4, the latter proportional to k1\xe2\x80\x98[CH4], on the same Sm2O3 sample as function of [O2] and temperature, led to the following expressions:\xe2\x80\x89 log (k3/k1) = \xe2\x88\x92(0.14 \xc2\xb1 0.30) + (663 \xc2\xb1 300)/T (I), log(k4/k1) = (1.08 \xc2\xb1 0.35) \xe2\x88\x92 (646 \xc2\xb1 365)/T (II), log (K1/nM-1) = (2.76 \xc2\xb1 0.46) \xe2\x88\x92 (4363 \xc2\xb1 468)/T (III), log (K3/nM-1) = (1.85 \xc2\xb1 0.22) \xe2\x88\x92 (4123 \xc2\xb1 260)/T (IV), log(K4/nM-1) = (5.31 \xc2\xb1 0.65) \xe2\x88\x92 (6480 \xc2\xb1 647)/T (V) (nM = 10-9M), that are independent of catalyst mass, active area, or morphology. Equations I\xe2\x88\x92V imply that ethane and ethylene are oxidized faster than methane at all relevant temperatures. Although the activation energies, E4 > E1 > E3, correlate with the corresponding BDE(C\xe2\x88\x92H) energies suggesting a common H-atom abstraction mechanism, the A-factor for the oxidation of ethylene is about tenfold larger. Oxidations occur on distinguishable Os species generated by endothermic, exentropic O2 chemisorption involving cooperative participation of the solid. "
"Reactions of laser-ablated Be and Mg atoms with C2H2, 13C2H2, and C2D2 upon condensation in excess argon at 10 K give new infrared absorptions that are assigned to the insertion and decomposition products HBeCCH, BeCCH, and MgCCH with the help of density functional theory isotopic frequency calculations. The 2019-cm-1 C\xe2\x8b\xaeC stretching fundamental for BeCCH is between values for BCCH and AlCCH, which are all slightly blue shifted from acetylene itself. "
"The UV (3.8 eV) photolysis of atomically-dispersed RhI(CO)2 species supported on an Al2O3 surface in the presence of N2 at 175 K caused the replacement of CO by N2 ligands. Therefore dinitrogen chemisorption effectively probes the coordinatively unsaturated Rh(CO) species generated during photodecomposition of RhI(CO)2/Al2O3. Two infrared bands, observed at 2234 and 2048 cm-1, are attributed respectively to \xce\xbdN2 and \xce\xbdCO in Rh(N2)(CO), and a band at 2188 cm-1 is assigned to Rh(N2)2 surface species. The assignments are based on frequencies and the relative rates of spectral development for the two N2-containing species. The Rh(N2)2 species on Al2O3 exhibits identical N\xe2\x88\x92N stretching modes to a similar species produced by matrix isolation methods. It is shown that both the Rh\xe2\x88\x92CO bond and the Rh\xe2\x88\x92N2 bond may be broken by photolysis. "
"The origin of differential binding affinity and structural recognition between the inclusion complexes of cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene), 14+, and 1,4-substituted phenyl or 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-substituted biphenyl derivatives has been jointly determined by spectrometric techniques and ab initio and semiempirical molecular orbital methods. The unusual boxed geometry and tetracationic charge distribution in 14+ are key molecular features which produce strong intermolecular interactions with guest and solvent molecules. Solvation was addressed by including up to 12 acetonitrile molecules in the theoretical model, which realigned the predicted gas-phase supramolecular structures and energies into excellent agreement with experiment. The computed complexation enthalpies, \xce\x94Hbind, from the semiempirical molecular orbital PM3 method are on average within 1 kcal/mol of the experimental free energy binding data collected from absorption spectroscopy in acetonitrile. In addition, the computed geometric penetration and positioning of 14+/benzidine and 14+/4,4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenol complexes are consistent with that reported from NMR NOE data. The partitioning of self-consistent field complexation energies from both classical and quantum forces has been determined by using Morokuma\'s variational energy decomposition technique. It was determined that the primary basis for the molecular recognition between 1,4-substituted phenyl guests and 14+ is short-range stabilizing electrostatic forces complemented by small amounts of polarizability and charge-transfer. In contrast, the recognition force between 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-substituted biphenyl guests and 14+ is dominated by polarizability with a small contribution from electrostatics. Therefore, the balance between molecular polarizability and electrostatics controls the differential binding affinity and structural recognition with 14+. For the first time, we report that individual molecular properties of substituted guests correlate with the binding energies of corresponding 14+ inclusion complexes. Direct correlations between the 14+ binding energies and the computed molecular polarizability, maximum hardness, softness, and electronegativity of the guest have been identified. It is now plausible to consider the design and construction of new supramolecular assemblies based upon a few select molecular properties of the constituent molecules. "
"The proton affinities of the cis and trans conformers of 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine have been determined at the MP2/6\xe2\x88\x9231G**//HF/6\xe2\x88\x9231G** level of theory. The neutral molecule and its protonated cation are both shown to possess stable cis and trans conformers:\xe2\x80\x89 the barriers for cis/trans interconversion, and the roles that electrostatic interactions and \xcf\x80-conjugation play in these barriers, are analyzed. In addition, the barriers to rotation through planar structures are reported. The structures, the effect of electron correlation on the energetics, and the ground state charge distributions are discussed (i) with respect to biphenyl and 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyrimidine and (ii) in the context of dinitrogen proton sponges. With regard to (i) and cis \xe2\x86\x92 trans interconversion, it appears that biphenyl, 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine, and 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyrimidine have almost identical conformers and rotational energetics. With regard to (ii), these results indicate that SCF estimates of proton affinities and proton transfer barriers in such compounds are overestimated (by 1\xe2\x88\x922% and \xe2\x88\xbc100%, respectively), and that barriers to rotation are underestimated by some 20\xe2\x88\x9230%.

"Transition moment directions of mid-infrared transitions in four isotopomers of propene, CH2CHCH3, CH2CDCH3, CD2CHCD3, and CD2CDCD3, have been determined from linear dichroism spectra recorded in stretched polyethylene as solvent. The results were compared with expectations based on bond directions and with results of ab initio calculations at levels of approximations ranging up to CCSD/6-311G**. The former procedure is found to be unreliable, even for high frequency vibrations. With rare exceptions, the highest levels of ab initio theory agree with the experimental directions to within about \xc2\xb120\xc2\xb0, and for intense transitions, to within the experimental uncertainty of about \xc2\xb1(5\xe2\x88\x9210)\xc2\xb0.

"Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), absorption, Raman, and Raman optical activity (ROA) spectra for the title compound, a cyclic dimer, were measured in non-aqueous solution. The vibrational normal modes are assigned based on the result from ab initio force field calculation. Harmonic frequencies and atomic polar tensors for simulation of IR absorption were calculated both on the (Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock SCF) HF/6-31G** level and using density functional theory (DFT) methods with the Becke3/LYP hybrid functional. Magnetic transition dipole derivatives were calculated on the HF/6-31G level, and the ROA polarizability tensors were calculated on the HF/4-31G level. Excellent agreement between the DFT calculated and experimental frequencies was obtained without a need for scaling. Furthermore, using the DFT force field, the correct VCD sign and intensity patterns were reproduced as compared to the experimental mid-IR spectra. Reasonable near-IR VCD and mid-IR ROA sign patterns for the intense peaks were also calculated. The excellent agreement for the mid-IR VCD results shows that medium-sized, biologically relevant molecules can have their spectra simulated using quantum mechanical techniques to a high level, certainly one suitable for conformational analyses by direct comparison of theory to experimental results. Comparison of DFT and HF level calculations suggests that the improvement found using DFT methods is primarily due to the force field and not to the intensity parameters. DFT atomic polar tensors were systematically weaker than the HF generated ones. Weak coupling between the subunits of this dimer implies dominance by local interactions which suggests that useful extension of these calculational techniques to larger oligomers might be accomplished by transfer of parameters. "
"The chemical bonding in an intriguing hypothetical organometallic three-dimensional structure, the realization of a (3,4)-connected net, is analyzed by band-structure calculations. The net, stoichiometry FeC4, has a structure which consists of infinite linear chains of Fe atoms that are cross-linked through kinked polyacetylene-like chains of carbon atoms. Densities of states and calculations (using the extended H\xc3\xbcckel approximate molecular orbital method) of a number of related one-dimensional infinite and molecular models are used to describe the bonding characteristics in the carbide. When combined in a three-dimensional framework, carbon and metal chains do not show any tendency to undergo the simple pairing distortions which are characteristic of isolated metal and carbon chains. That these separated chains lose their driving force toward distortion upon fusion is explained by charge transfer from the carbon \xcf\x80-system to the metal d block and a more rigid \xcf\x83-bonded framework. If one moves to MC4 with M carrying fewer electrons than Fe, the MM bond strengthens, and CC bonding is weakened; for M having more electrons the trend is reversed. A number of intriguing hypothetical related compounds, formed by incorporation of metal chains into the large channels present in the MC4 phase or by substitution of polyacenes for polyacetylenes, are proposed.

"The synthesis of an RNA dinucleotide (IspU) containing a 3\xe2\x80\x98-S-phosphorothiolate linkage is described. The compound is prepared from 9-(3-deoxy-3-iodo-\xce\xb2-d-xylofuranosyl)hypoxanthine with installation of the phosphorothiolate group via an Arbusov reaction and protection of the ribose 2\xe2\x80\x98-hydroxyl as a silyl ether. IspU is found to be a substrate for several enzymes including T4 polynucleotide kinase, snake venom phosphodiesterase, and ribonuclease T2. Base-catalyzed cleavage of the dinucleotide is accelerated (\xe2\x88\xbc2000-fold) relative to that of the phosphate-linked compound IpU. Product characterization and kinetic analysis show that IspU is cleaved through the same mechanism as IpU. The observed rate acceleration is argued to reflect stabilization of the anionic transition state by the polarizable sulfur atom. "
"Template-assembled collagen-based polypeptides KTA-[Gly-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)n-NH2]3 (n = 1, 3, 5, 6; KTA is cis,cis-1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, also known as the Kemp triacid) and acetyl-terminated single-chain collagen-based analogs Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)n-NH2 (n = 1, 3, 5, 6, 9) were synthesized by solid phase segment condensation methods. The triple-helical propensities of these collagen analogs were investigated using circular dichroism, ultraviolet absorbance, optical rotation, and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The acetyl analogs, Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)n-NH2 (n = 6, 9), assume a stable triple-helical conformation in H2O (0.2 mg/mL) at room temperature. By contrast, Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)5-NH2 adopts a triple-helical conformation in H2O only below 18 \xc2\xb0C at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. For the template-assembled collagen analogs, results show that KTA-[Gly-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)n-NH2]3 (n = 5, 6) peptides form triple-helical structures which have melting temperatures above 70 \xc2\xb0C in H2O. These melting temperatures are much higher than those of the corresponding acetyl analogs, demonstrating the significant triple-helix-stabilizing effects of the KTA template. In addition, the KTA template facilitates triple-helical structures by dramatically accelerating triple-helix formation. "
"Using 1D and 2D 1H-NMR and molecular modeling, we characterized the conformational features of template-assembled collagen-like polypeptides of the type KTA-[Gly-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)n-NH2]3 (n = 1, 3, 5, 6; KTA denotes the Kemp triacid) and of the corresponding acetylated single-chain polypeptides Ac-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)n-NH2 (n = 1, 3, 5, 6, 9) in water. We established the presence of triple-helical conformations on the basis of consistent experimental observations including the appearance of a set of distinct assembled resonances and the measurement of low hydrogen-exchange rates for the assembled Gly NH of the longer chain analogs. In addition, following the pioneering work of Brodsky et al. we proved the consistency of the NOESY spectra with the interchain NOEs anticipated by the X-ray model for triple-helical (Gly-Pro-Hyp) sequences. For the KTA-terminated structures the triple helicity is further supported by the KTA signal splitting detected for KTA-[Gly-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)n-NH2]3 (n = 3, 5, 6) and caused by the triple-helical screw symmetry which breaks the rotational symmetry of KTA. Thermal melting studies indicate that the KTA template leads to a significant gain in the free energy of triple-helix formation. This free energy gain results in a remarkable increase of the thermal stabilities of the KTA terminated compounds as compared to the acetyl analogs. Our NMR results are fully consistent with our previous investigations based on CD, UV, and optical rotation spectroscopic methods. "
"The enantioselectivity of cross-linked crystals of \xce\xb3-chymotrypsin in the transesterification of the medicinally important compound methyl 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropionate (1) with propanol has been examined in a variety of organic solvents. The (kcat/KM)S/kcat/KM)R ratio in this enzymatic process can be forced to span a 20-fold range simply by switching from one solvent to another; in fact, while the enzyme strongly prefers the S-enantiomer of 1 in some solvents, the R-antipode is more reactive in others. These striking observations are quantitatively rationalized by accounting for the energetics of desolvation of S-1 and R-1 in the enzyme-bound transition states. In order to accomplish this, explicit rules have been established for the modeling and thermodynamic quantification of the partially desolvated substrate\'s transition state moieties. "
"An investigation of the mechanism of solvolysis of CMP-N-acetyl neuraminate (CMP-NeuAc) is presented that includes synthesis of a family of isotopically labeled CMP-NeuAc\'s, use of new methodology for measurement of multiple kinetic isotope effects for acid-catalyzed solvolysis of CMP-NeuAc, and a stereochemical analysis of the reaction by solvolysis in aqueous methanol. The CMP-NeuAc isotopomers were synthesized with the following labels:\xe2\x80\x89 [9-3H], [1-14C-N-acetyl], [2-14C], [1-14C], and [9-3H;3,3\xe2\x80\x98-2H] in yields of 78%, 86%, 76%, 85%, and 35%, respectively. The \xce\xb2-dideuterium kinetic isotope effect for solvolysis at pH 5.0, 37 \xc2\xb0C, was 1.276 \xc2\xb1 0.008; the primary 14C isotope effect at C2, the anomeric carbon, was 1.030 \xc2\xb1 0.004; and an unusually large secondary 14C KIE was observed at C1, the carboxylate carbon, of 1.037 \xc2\xb1 0.004. Analysis of pH versus rate data and rate versus buffer concentration data establish that the solvolytic reaction is specific acid-catalyzed. Solvolysis of CMP-NeuAc at pH 5 or pH 6 in methanol/water mixtures afforded NeuAc, equal quantities of the \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-methyl glycosides of NeuAc, and small amounts of the elimination product 2,3-dehydro-N-acetyl neuraminic acid. The very large \xce\xb2-2H KIE, small primary 14C KIE, and the large secondary 14C KIE at the carboxylate carbon are consistent with a very late oxocarbenium ion-like transition state in which the carboxylate carbon is in a looser environment than in the ground state. The observation of racemization in the solvolysis reaction supports a reaction pathway that proceeds with the formation of a sialyl cation after the transition state. "
"A tetrafunctional site-directed reagent for protein modification has the potential for introducing specific cross-links by reaction at two of its four reactive sites. The remaining reactive groups on the link within the protein are available for further reaction with added reagents. The first example of such a designed multifunctional cross-linker, 3,5,3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-biphenyltetracarbonyl tetrakis(3,5-dibromosalicylate), BTDS (1), was prepared by treatment of the tetra tert-butyl ester with trifluoroacetic acid. The ester was from reaction of the acid chloride of biphenyl 3,5,3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-tetracarboxylic acid with tert-butyl-3,5-dibromosalicylate. BTDS contains four anionic sites each adjacent to four electrophilic sites. The reaction of BTDS with deoxy human hemoglobin A generates in high yield the biphenyl bis carboxamide at the \xce\xb5-amino of lysine-82 of each of the \xce\xb2 subunits (BBS-Hb). The remaining ester groups from the biphenyl cross-link are available to react with other nucleophiles. This is demonstrated by efficient reaction with ethylenediamine. The use of multifunctional cross-linkers presents opportunities for introduction of probes and bioactive materials. "
"A comparison of a closely related set of cyclic octapeptides demonstrates how Nature has adapted two common amino acid building blocks (Thr, Cys) as conformational ring constraints (oxazoline, thiazole) to regulate the three-dimensional structures and reactivities of marine macrocycles. A 2D NMR spectroscopic study shows that conversion of two Cys residues in the flexible cyclic octapeptide 1, c[Ile-Thr-d-Val-Cys-Ile-Thr-d-Val-Cys-], to 5-membered thiazole rings (Thz) leads to the formation of a novel pseudochair conformation in 2, c[Ile-Thr-d-(Val)Thz-Ile-Thr-d-(Val)Thz-]. The conformational flexibility of 2 is significantly restricted by three intramolecular hydrogen bonds induced by the d-(Val)Thz components, resulting in a single solution conformation with non-C2 symmetric side chains. Additional modification, through conversion of the two threonine side chains to 5-membered oxazoline rings (Oxn), produces a highly constrained pseudoboat or saddle-shaped macrocycle, c[(Ile)Oxn-d-(Val)Thz-(Ile)Oxn-d-(Val)Thz-] (7), having C2 symmetric side chains. Acid hydrolysis of 7, previously isolated from the ascidian Lissoclinum patella, selectively opens the two oxazoline rings with further conformational rearrangement to a novel cyclic octapeptide (8) possessing a shallower pseudoboat conformation. The comparison reveals that oxazoline and thiazole rings impose severe conformational restrictions upon these cyclic octapeptides, creating unusual shapes and clefts with varying capacities to capture organic or metal ion guests (e.g. 10). Such dramatic changes in macrocycle shape may be related to the differential antitumour and metal-binding properties of this class of molecule. "
"Various \xcf\x80-conjugated copolymers constituted of \xcf\x80-excessive thiophene, selenophene, or furan units (Ar) and \xcf\x80-deficient pyridine or quinoxaline (Ar\xe2\x80\x98) units have been prepared in high yields by the following organometallic polycondensation methods:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) n X\xe2\x88\x92Ar\xe2\x88\x92Ar\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92X + n Ni(0)Lm \xe2\x86\x92 (-Ar\xe2\x88\x92Ar\xe2\x80\x98)-n (X = halogen, Ni(0)Lm = zerovalent nickel complex), (ii) n X\xe2\x88\x92Ar\xe2\x88\x92X + n Me3Sn\xe2\x88\x92Ar\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92SnMe3 \xe2\x86\x92 (-Ar\xe2\x88\x92Ar\xe2\x80\x98)-n (palladium catalyzed), and (iii) a X\xe2\x88\x92Ar\xe2\x88\x92X + b X\xe2\x88\x92Ar\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92X + (a + b)Ni(0)Lm \xe2\x86\x92 (-Ar)x(Ar\xe2\x80\x98)-y. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis confirms an alternative structure of a polymer prepared by the method ii. The copolymers have a molecular weight of 5.4 \xc3\x97 103 to 3.3 \xc3\x97 105 and an [\xce\xb7] value of 0.37 to 4.4 dL g-1. \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80* absorption bands of the copolymers generally show red shifts from those of the corresponding homopolymers, (-Ar)-n and (-Ar\xe2\x80\x98)-n, and the red shifts are accounted for by charge-transferred CT structures of the copolymers. For example, an alternative copolymer of thiophene and 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline gives rise to an absorption band at \xce\xbbmax = 603 nm, whereas homopolymers of thiophene and 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline exhibit absorption peaks at about 460 and 440 nm, respectively. The CT copolymers are electrochemically active in both oxidation and reduction regions, showing oxidation (or p-doping) peaks in a range of 0.39 to 1.32 V vs Ag/Ag+ and reduction (or n-doping) peaks in a range of \xe2\x88\x921.80 to \xe2\x88\x922.22 V vs Ag/Ag+, respectively. Copolymers of pyridine give unique cyclic voltammograms exhibiting p-undoping peaks at potentials much different (about 2\xe2\x88\x923 V lower) from the corresponding p-doping potentials, and this large difference between p-doping and p-undoping potentials is explained by an EC mechanism. They are converted into semiconductors by chemical and electrochemical oxidation and reduction. Copolymers of thiophene with pyridine and quinoxaline show the third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility \xcf\x87(3) of about 5 \xc3\x97 10-11 esu at the three-photon resonant wavelength, which is 5\xe2\x88\x927 times larger than those of the corresponding homopolymers and related to the CT structure in the copolymers.

"Intramolecular chemically initiated electron exchange luminescence (CIEEL) was studied in the alkaline phosphatase triggering of the spiroadamantyl-substituted 1,2-dioxetanes AMPPD and CSPD, which are widely employed in modern chemiluminescent bioassays, particularly in clinical immunoassay applications. Experimental data on the pH dependence of the CIEEL efficiency, the CIEEL emitter fluorescence lifetime, the rate of cleavage of the dephosphorylated dioxetane 2a, the turnover number, and the Michaelis constant are reported and kinetically rationalized. Through this detailed kinetic analysis, the pH effects on the various steps of the CIEEL process were elucidated. Although every step of the triggering involves H+ or HO- ions, it was shown that at alkaline pH and steady-state conditions only enzymatic dephosphorylation of AMPPD and CSPD depends on pH in this CIEEL process. The turnover number is affected only at pH below 9, which reflects a switchover of the rate-determining step of the enzyme dephosphorylation to its phosphorylation at increasing pH. The Michaelis constant depends on pH within the entire range used, which is attributed to the pH effect on the concentration of the catalytically active enzyme form. The present model kinetic studies on the important alkaline-phosphatase-triggered CIEEL reaction provide the necessary mechanistic insights to understand pH effects in such enzymatic processes for the rational design of more effective CIEEL systems.

"An efficient regiocontrolled approach to the synthesis of 8-fluoropurines by direct fluorination of purines with dilute elemental fluorine is described. The one-step procedure produced regiospecific substitution of the C(8)-hydrogen of purine derivatives in isolated yields close to 30% with protected purines in CHCl3. Fluorination yields with unprotected purines in EtOH were reduced to less than 10%. The electrophilic fluorination procedure has a broad scope of applicability and permits a ready and easy access to 8-fluoropurine derivatives, for the first time, for evaluation of their biochemical and pharmacological properties.

"Trapoxin, a cyclotetrapeptide isolated from the fungus Helicoma ambiens, profoundly affects mammalian cell growth and morphology. In this paper, we describe syntheses of trapoxin, [3H]trapoxin, and K-trap, a trapoxin-based affinity reagent. These reagents have allowed us to achieve the first molecular characterization of histone deacetylase, trapoxin\'s cellular target. "
"Hydrogen/deuterium exchange was observed by 2H-NMR spectroscopy at the CH3 groups of the long-lived alkanoyl cations CH3CH2CO+ (4), (CH3)2CHCO+ (8), and (CH3)3CCO+ (13) when treated with excess DF\xc2\xb7SbF5 superacid. The intermediacy of the corresponding protio(deuterio)acylium dications is suggested to account for the exchanges. Under similar conditions, no exchange was observed in the acetyl ion CH3CO+ (1) in DF\xc2\xb7SbF5, but at the same time its electrophilic reactivity is greatly enhanced in superacids. The acetyl cation in a superacidic medium also abstracts tertiary hydrogens of isoalkanes to give protonated acetaldehyde. Density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level were carried out to support the suggested exchange mechanism as well as lack of exchange in the acetyl cation. On the basis of the calculated results, two alternative mechanisms are also suggested for the Nenitzescu rearrangement of pivaloyl chloride in isobutane with excess AlCl3. "
"Clostridium thermoaceticum and other autotrophic anaerobic bacteria contain a bifunctional enzyme, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase (CODH/ACS), that catalyzes two reactions of CO at two separate Ni\xe2\x88\x92FeS clusters. Oxidation of CO to CO2 is catalyzed by Cluster C, while incorporation of CO into acetyl-CoA occurs at Cluster A. In this study, resonance Raman [RR] and infrared [IR] spectroscopy are applied to the adduct of Cluster C with cyanide, a selective inhibitor of CO oxidation. The RR spectra reveal that CN- binds simultaneously to Fe and Ni, because bands whose 13C and 15N shifts identify them as cyanide\xe2\x88\x92metal stretching and bending modes are sensitive to incorporation of both 54Fe and 64Ni into the enzyme. The IR spectrum reveals a low frequency, 2037 cm-1, for the C\xe2\x88\x92N stretch, indicative of FeII binding via the C end. Vibrational modeling of the frequencies and isotope shifts indicates a bent Fe\xe2\x88\x92CN\xe2\x88\x92Ni bridging geometry, with a \xe2\x88\xbc140\xc2\xb0 C\xe2\x88\x92N\xe2\x88\x92Ni angle. This geometry of the inhibitory adduct suggests that CO oxidation involves a bimetallic mechanism. It is proposed that pre-organization of the metal ions by the enzyme promotes CO oxidation by NiII\xe2\x88\x92OH- attack on FeII\xe2\x88\x92CO, followed by Ni\xe2\x88\x92FeS reduction as CO2 is released. This chemistry is analogous to the metal-catalyzed water-gas shift reaction. "
"The CuA site of cytochrome c oxidase and the type 1 Cu site of cupredoxins occur in homologous protein folds with a His2Cys ligand set, but are distinguished by the presence of a second Cys and a second Cu in CuA that result in the formation of a dithiolate-bridged dinuclear Cu cluster. The resonance Raman (RR) spectrum of the soluble CuA-containing fragment from Paracoccus denitrificans exhibits intense vibrations at 260 and 339 cm-1. Their respective 34S-isotope shifts of \xe2\x88\x924.1 and \xe2\x88\x925.1 cm-1 allow them to be assigned to two Cu\xe2\x88\x92S stretching modes, \xce\xbd(Cu\xe2\x88\x92S), of the Cu2S2Im2 moiety. A normal coordinate analysis (NCA) of the RR spectra of CuA substituted with isotopes of S, Cu, and N was carried out to determine whether it is possible to distinguish between dinuclear models with bridging or terminal cysteine ligands. Whereas the terminal Cys model predicts that both of the \xce\xbd(Cu\xe2\x88\x92S) modes lie between 340 and 350 cm-1, the bridging Cys geometry successfully predicts the S-shifts at 260 and 339 cm-1. Thus, the Raman data and NCA are fully consistent with the bridging cysteine coordination observed by X-ray crystallography. The agreement between predicted and observed vibrational isotope data is further improved by a trans-tilting of the imidazole nitrogens above and below the Cu2S2 plane, yielding a distorted tetrahedral geometry for each of the Cu atoms. Whereas type 1 protein RR spectra are highly N-dependent due to extended vibronic coupling with amide vibrations of the cysteine ligand, the vibrations in CuA are relatively insensitive to N-isotope substitution. Thus, unlike type 1 Cu, the RR spectrum of CuA can be successfully modeled with only the Cu2S2(Im)2 core. "
"An N4O3 tripodal tren-based (aminomethylene)phosphinato ligand tris(4-(phenylphosphinato)-3-methyl-3-azabutyl)amine (H3ppma) has been synthesized, and its complexation properties with the group 13 metals Al, Ga, and In have been investigated. The molecular structure of the indium complex [In(H3ppma)2](NO3)3\xc2\xb73H2O (C60H96InN11O24P6) has been solved by X-ray methods; the complex crystallizes in the trigonal space group R3\xcc\x84c, with a = 18.984(3) \xc3\x85, c = 36.256(5) \xc3\x85, and Z = 6. The structure was solved by Patterson methods and was refined by full-matrix least-squares procedures to R = 0.040 (Rw = 0.039) for 1415 reflections with I > 3\xcf\x83(I). The structure of the bis-complex showed the ligand to coordinate in a tridentate manner through the three phosphinate oxygens, resulting in a bicapped octahedral structure of exact S6 symmetry. The solved structure was of the RRRSSS diastereomer, where half of the molecule contained phosphorus atoms of R chirality and the other half contained phosphorus atoms of S chirality. The highly symmetric environment about the metal atoms produces a low electric field gradient at the metal nucleus leading to unusually narrow line widths in the 27Al, 71Ga, and 115In NMR spectra. The aluminum complex [Al(H3ppma)2](NO3)3\xc2\xb72H2O exhibited an extremely rare example of aluminum\xe2\x88\x92phosphorus coupling in both the 31P and 27Al NMR spectra, where 2JAlP was shown from both spectra to be 6.7 Hz. The narrow line widths made the complexes amenable to stability constant studies via a combination of 27Al, 71Ga, and 31P NMR spectroscopies (25 \xc2\xb0C). The formation constants for In3+ (log \xce\xb22 \xe2\x89\xa5 5.4), Ga3+ (log \xce\xb22 = 4.24), and Al3+ (log \xce\xb21 = 0.93, log \xce\xb22 = 3.45) decrease by an order of magnitude as the group is ascended, consistent with increasing steric interactions of the phenyl groups as the two trisphosphinate ligands are crowded together in order to coordinate the smaller metal ions. Variable temperature 27Al and 31P NMR spectroscopic studies indicated the RRRSSS diastereomer to be rigid up to 55 \xc2\xb0C in CD3OD. "
"Synthetic routes to the metallole species C4Me4E(H)R (9, E = Si, R = Si(SiMe3)3; 10, E = Si, R = Mes (mesityl); 11, E = Ge, R = Si(SiMe3)3; 12, E = Ge, R = Mes), C4R4E(SiMe3)2 (13, E = Si, R = Me; 14, E = Ge, R = Me; 19, E = Si, R = Et; 20, E = Ge, R = Et), and C4Me4E(R)E(R)Me4C4 (15, E = Si, R = SiMe3; 16, E = Si, R = Me; 17, E = Ge, R = SiMe3; 18, E = Ge, R = Me) are described. In the presence of 18-crown-6, dihalides 1 and 2 are reduced by potassium in tetrahydrofuran to give crystalline samples of the silole dianion [K(18-crown-6)+]2[C4Me4Si2-] (21) and the germole dianion [K4(18-crown-6)3][C4Me4Ge]2 (22). Compound 21 adopts an inverse-sandwich geometry, while 22 is a dimer with a bridging [K(18-crown-6)K]2+ group and \xce\xb75-binding modes for all of the potassium atoms. The metallole dianions in these structures appear to possess delocalized \xcf\x80-systems, as evidenced by nearly equivalent C\xe2\x88\x92C bond lengths in the five-membered rings. Silolyl and germolyl anions have been obtained by various methods involving nucleophilic cleavage of bonds to germanium and silicon. Deprotonation of 11 and 12 in the presence of a crown ether gave the anions [K(18-crown-6)][C4Me4GeR] (23, R = Si(SiMe3)3; 24, R = Mes) and [Li(12-crown-4)2][C4Me4GeR] (25, R = Si(SiMe3)3; 26, R = Mes). NMR parameters for these species, and X-ray structures for 25 and 26, indicate that the anionic rings possess pyramidal germanium centers and bond localization in the diene portion of the ring. Spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic data for [Na(15-crown-5)][C4Me4GeMe] (28), prepared by reductive cleavage of the Ge\xe2\x88\x92Ge bond in 18, reveal a similar structure for the germolyl ring. The latter compound possesses a Na\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Ge interaction in the solid state. Silolyl and germolyl anions M[C4Me4E(SiMe3)] (30, E = Si, M = Li; 31, E = Si, M = K; 32, E = Si, M = Li(12-crown-4)2; 33, E = Si, M = K(18-crown-6); 34, E = Ge, M = K; 35, E = Ge, M = K(18-crown-6)) have been prepared by nucleophilic cleavage of the E\xe2\x88\x92SiMe3 bond in C4Me4E(SiMe3)2 with MCH2Ph (M = Li, K). By similar methods, the monoanionic species [K(18-crown-6)][C4Me4E(SiMe3)C4Me4E] (36, E = Si; 37, E = Ge) were obtained. A crystal structure determination for 33 revealed a highly pyramidalized Si center (the angle between the C4Si plane and the Si\xe2\x88\x92Si bond is 99.6\xc2\xb0) and pronounced double bond localization in the ring. Interaction between the [K(18-crown-6)]+ cation and the anion is rather weak, as indicated by the K\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Si distance (3.604(2) \xc3\x85) and the atomic position for K. By variable-temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy, inversion barriers for the compounds [Li(12-crown-4)2][C4Et4ESiMe3] (38, E = Si; 40, E = Ge) and K[C4Et4ESiMe3] (39, E = Si; 41, E = Ge) were estimated. Barriers for the germolyl anions 40 and 41 (10.5(1) and 9.4(1) kcal mol-1, respectively) are distinctly higher than those for the corresponding silolyl anions 38 and 39, as might be expected from periodic trends. The silolyl anions exhibited coalescence temperatures below the freezing point of tetrahydrofuran (165 K), but upper limits to the inversion barriers were estimated from spectra recorded at the lowest temperatures (\xe2\x89\xa48.4 kcal mol-1 for 38 and <8.4 kcal mol-1 for 39). The measured inversion barriers for compounds 38\xe2\x88\x9241 provide energy differences between the pyramidal anions and their corresponding planar (possibly aromatic) structures, and their low values may be attributed to stability imparted to the transition state by delocalization of \xcf\x80-electron density in the ring.

"The digold(I) complexes Au2(\xce\xbc-C6H4PR2)2 [R = Ph (1a), Et (1b)] obtained by treatment of AuBr(PEt3) with o-LiC6H4PR2 undergo addition with halogens or benzoyl peroxide to give metal\xe2\x88\x92metal bonded digold(II) complexes Au2X2(\xce\xbc-C6H4PR2)2 [R = Ph, Et; X = I (2a, 2b), Br (3a, 3b), Cl (4a, 4b), O2CPh (5a, 5b)], which are structurally similar to the bis(ylide) complexes Au2X2{\xce\xbc-(CH2)2PR2}2. The benzoate ligands in 5b are monodentate and the gold\xe2\x88\x92gold bond length [2.5243(7) \xc3\x85] is significantly less than that in the diiodide (2a) [2.5898(6) \xc3\x85, 2.5960 (\xc3\x85) for independent molecules], reflecting the trans influences of the axial anionic ligands. The corresponding complexes Au2X2(\xce\xbc-C6H4PR2)2 [R = Ph, Et; X = O2CMe (6a, 6b), ONO2 (7a, 7b)] are made from 2\xe2\x88\x924 and the appropriate silver salt. The axial anionic ligands undergo immediate scrambling when solutions of Au2X2(\xce\xbc-C6H4PR2)2 and Au2Y2(\xce\xbc-C6H4PR2)2 are mixed. The bridging C6H4PR2 units also scramble rapidly on mixing solutions of Au2X2(\xce\xbc-C6H4PPh2)2 [X = I (2a), Br (3a)] and Au2X2(\xce\xbc-C6H4PEt2)2 [X = I (2b), Br (3b)], but this occurs only slowly for X = Cl and not at all for X = O2CPh, O2CMe, or ONO2. Solutions of the diiodo complexes 2a, 2b and the dibromo complexes 3a, 3b isomerize cleanly to the digold(I) complexes Au2X2(\xce\xbc-R2PC6H4C6H4PR2) [R = Ph, Et; X = I (8a, 8b), Br (9a, 9b)] containing 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-biphenylyl(diphenylphosphine) or 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-biphenylyl(diethylphosphine), respectively, as a consequence of a reductive elimination in which a C\xe2\x88\x92C bond is formed at the expense of two Au\xe2\x88\x92C bonds. In 8b the Au\xe2\x88\x92Au separation is 3.167(1) \xc3\x85 and the phenyl rings of the biphenyl unit are almost orthogonal. Qualitatively, the rates of isomerization of Au2X2(\xce\xbc-C6H4PR2)2 to Au2X2(\xce\xbc-R2PC6H4C6H4PR2) are in the order R = Ph > Et; X = I > Br >> Cl; isomerization does not occur for X = O2CPh, O2CMe, or ONO2. The rates of thermal isomerization of 2a and 3a are first order in complex, only slightly sensitive to solvent polarity, and, for 2a, inhibited by iodide ion. It is suggested that reversible loss of halide ion initiates aryl group transfer between the gold atoms, thus allowing reductive elimination of Au\xe2\x88\x92C bonds to take place at one center. Treatment of 2a or 3a with an excess of iodine or bromine gives initially digold(III) complexes cis,trans-Au2X4(\xce\xbc-C6H4PPh2)2 [X = I (14), Br (15)], which are in equilibrium with monomers AuX2(C6H4PPh2) [X = I (16), Br (17)], as shown by 31P NMR spectroscopy. These species isomerize at room temperature by internal electrophilic cleavage of their Au\xe2\x88\x92C bonds to give stable gold(I) complexes of (2-halogenophenyl)diphenylphosphine, AuX(o-XC6H4PPh2) [X = I (12), Br (11)].

"We have developed the synthesis of unsymmetrical metalloporphyrazines of the form M[pz(A:B3)], where A and B refer to two different types of peripheral functionality, and have used it to prepare new bi- and trimetallic solitaire-porphyrazines in which A represents a mono- or bimetallic moiety. The macrocyclic complexes described are based on the binucleating ligand, [M(norphthalocyanine-2,3-dithiolate)]2-, [M(norpc)]2-. This can be thought of as a metalloporphyrazine where B is a fused benzo ring; A represents two thiolates fused at the \xce\xb2-pyrrole positions to form a dithiolene moiety that can bind a transition-metal ion in addition to one within the macrocyclic cavity. solitaire-Porphyrazines have been synthesized by chelation of [(L-L)M\xe2\x80\x98]2+ to the [M(norpc)]2- ligand where M = \xe2\x80\x9c2H\xe2\x80\x9d, Ni, Cu, or Mn-Cl, L-L is a bis(diphosphino) or bis(diamino) group and M\xe2\x80\x98 = Ni, Pd, or Pt. Crystal structures have been obtained for 11b, where the [H2(norpc)]2- ligand coordinates the diphosphinopalladium moiety, [Pd(dppf)]2+, by the two thiolate sulfur atoms at its periphery, and for 11h, with the diaminoplatinum moiety, [Pt(teeda)]2+, bound to the periphery of the [Ni(norpc)]2- ligand. In crystals of 11b and 11h, the molecules appear as face-to-face dimers. However, the dimer of 11b and the two crystallographically independent dimers of 11h each shows a distinctly different degree of overlap. The electronic absorption spectra of a series of porphyrazines in which the two peripheral sulfur atoms form thioether moieties with a modified benzyl-protecting group (6\xe2\x88\x9210) show that the peripheral asymmetry of the macrocyclic framework causes a strong splitting of the (\xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80*) Q-band. In contrast, when the peripheral sulfurs bind a metal ion to form solitaire-porphyrazines 11a\xe2\x88\x92h, the optical spectra closely resemble that of the symmetrical pc, with unsplit Q band. The EPR spectrum of solitaire 11d, where M = Cu, L-L = a bis(diphosphino) cap, M\xe2\x80\x98 = Pd, has features consistent with other square-planar copper(II) porphyrins and phthalocyanines. Cyclic voltammograms of compound 11b shows two reversible ring reductions at potentials similar to those of H2(pc) as well as a reversible oxidation associated with the ferrocene portion of the Pd(dppf) moiety.

"Peripherally-functionalized porphyrazines of the form M[pz(An:B4-n)] (inset 1), where A and B symbolize functional moieties (e.g., a\xe2\x88\x92d in Table 1) fused directly to the \xce\xb2-positions of the pyrroles, have the potential to serve in a wide range of applications. Previously, we reported the synthesis of porphyrazinedi- and octathiolate ligands, M[pz(b3:c1)] and M[pz(c4)], respectively, where b is a fused benzo ring and c represents two thiolates fused at the \xce\xb2-pyrrole positions to form a dithiolene capable of the peripheral chelation of a metal ion. We describe here a general strategy that solves the more difficult problem of preparing and isolating the porphyrazinetetra- and hexathioethers and the porphyrazinetetra- and hexathiolates, with the focus being the trinuclear metal complexes of the trans- and cis-porphyrazinetetrathiolate isomers (trans- and cis-M[pz(b2:d2)]), denoted as gemini porphyrazines. Spectroscopic and electrochemical studies reveal that the physical properties of the cis- and trans-tetrathioether porphyrazines exhibit intriguing differences associated with their distinct molecular symmetries. These functionalized macrocycles have been used to prepare the trans- and cis-gemini porphyrazines 14 and 16, the two isomeric porphyrazinetetrathiolate macrocycles that are peripherally-metalated with two bis(triethylphosphine)platinum(II) moieties. The X-ray structure of the trans isomer, 14, is presented; it is the first structure of a porphyrazine or phthalocyanine having a trans-type substitution pattern. "
"The identity carbon-to-carbon proton transfer between oxygen-protonated acetaldehyde (syn and anti) and acetaldehyde enol (syn and anti) has been studied by ab initio methods at the 6-311+G**//6-311+G**, MP2/6-311+G**//6-311+G**, and MP2/6-311+G**//MP2/6-311+G** levels. Previous calculations on the proton transfer between acetaldehyde and its enolate ion have been extended to the MP2/6-311+G**//MP2/6-311+G** level. On the basis of Mulliken and natural population analysis charges, the transition states of all reactions under study show a strong imbalance in the sense that charge shift in the product enol lags behind proton transfer and charge shift in the reactant enol is ahead of proton transfer. The imbalance in the reactions of CH3CHOH+ is larger than in the reaction of CH3CHO, and larger for the syn than the anti configuration of CH3CHOH+. At the highest level of calculation, the enthalpy difference, \xce\x94H, between the transition state and separated reactants is about \xe2\x88\x925 kcal/mol (anti) and \xe2\x88\x922 kcal/mol (syn) for the reactions of CH3CHOH+, which compares with \xce\x94H \xe2\x89\x88 0 kcal/mol for the aldehyde reaction. When basis set superposition error corrections are applied, these \xce\x94H values become \xe2\x88\x922.6, 0.5, and 3.3 kcal/mol, respectively. The trend in these \xce\x94H values can be understood mainly as the result of an interplay between the effect of the increased acidity of the carbon acid, which makes \xce\x94H more negative, and the effect of a large imbalance, which makes \xce\x94H less negative or more positive. Electrostatic or hydrogen-bonding stabilization of the transition state is also likely to play a role by attenuating these effects. Specifically, the lower \xce\x94H for the reactions of CH3CHOH+ compared to CH3CHO is attributed to the much stronger acidity of CH3CHOH+ which more than offsets the effect of the larger imbalance and the loss of electrostatic or hydrogen-bonding stabilization; on the other hand, the higher \xce\x94H for the reaction of CH3CHOH+ (syn) compared to that of CH3CHOH+ (anti) can be explained by the dominance of the imbalance factor. The reaction paths through the imbalanced transition states can be represented by means of a six-corner More O\'Ferrall\xe2\x88\x92Jencks type diagram with separate axes for proton transfer and electronic/structural reorganization. The larger imbalance for the reaction of CH3CHOH+ (syn) compared to CH3CHOH+ (anti) is consistent with the relative energies of the intermediate corners of the diagram in the two reactions, but this is not the case for the larger imbalance in the reactions of CH3CHOH+ compared to that of CH3CHO. This latter discrepancy is probably a consequence of an overinterpretation of the More O\'Ferrall\xe2\x88\x92Jencks diagram when applied to large perturbations. "
"Carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon bond activation in adsorbed cyclopropane is observed following exposure to gas phase atomic hydrogen on the Ni(100) surface for temperatures as low as 100 K. Exposure to either gas phase atomic hydrogen or deuterium results in formation of adsorbed propyl. In both cases subsequent reaction between adsorbed propyl and coadsorbed hydrogen/deuterium produces propane at 121 K. The activation of a single C\xe2\x88\x92C bond in adsorbed cyclopropane dominates as indicated by the fact that propane is the only product observed. No multiple C\xe2\x88\x92C bond activation which would result in methane or ethane formation was ever observed. These reactions and their mechanisms have been investigated using temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) and vibrational spectroscopy using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). The reactivities of hydrogen and deuterium were indistinguishable during these experiments so we have used the generic term hydrogen or gas phase atomic hydrogen to describe the reactions of both hydrogen and deuterium. The vibrational spectrum of adsorbed cyclopropane indicates weak interaction with the Ni(100) surface at 100 K. This weak interaction results in molecular cyclopropane desorption at 123 K with only a small amount of dehydrogenation. After atomic hydrogen exposure, a new loss feature appears at 383 cm-1 in the vibrational spectrum. This new mode corresponds to the Ni\xe2\x88\x92C bond stretching mode of adsorbed propyl, the primary reaction intermediate. Carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon bond activation in adsorbed cyclopropane also causes substantial reduction in the intensities of cyclopropane\'s ring deformation modes at 821 and 1006 cm-1. These results clearly indicate that C\xe2\x88\x92C bond activation occurs during exposure to gas phase atomic hydrogen. Isotopic labeling studies reveal that the adsorbed propyl intermediate is hydrogenated by labelled surface hydrogen. Carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon bond activation in adsorbed cyclopropane has never been observed during adsorption on a surface with preadsorbed hydrogen nor during exposure to nascent hydrogen formed by dissociating molecular hydrogen. A detailed potential energy diagram for the reactions of adsorbed cyclopropane on the Ni(100) surface is developed based on results from these experiments and the literature. "
"Protonations of \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-d-glucopyranose in the gas phase were investigated using the ab initio molecular orbital approach at the HF/6-31G* level with full geometry optimization. Minimum-energy structures of three neutral and six protonated species for each anomer were calculated. Geometries, energies, and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in these structures are discussed. For the neutral species at 298 K the order of stability for the hydroxymethyl conformers is calculated to be GT > GG > TG for the \xce\xb1 anomer and GG > GT > TG for the \xce\xb2 anomer. Protonated species that least disrupt the internal hydrogen bonding network in the neutral species are considered; these include protonations on the oxygen sites labeled as the hydroxymethyl O6, the ring O5, and the exocylic hydroxyl O4. The O6 protonation in the TG conformation is electronically most favored. Energy corrections for basis-set deficiency and electron-correlation omission in the adopted theoretical procedure were estimated from high-level calculations on ethanol, 2-propanol, and dimethyl ether. In addition, the gas-phase basicity (GB) of glucose was measured by proton transfer reactions in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. The experimental GB values for both anomers were determined to be 188 \xc2\xb1 3 kcal/mol. The experimental values are compared with the ab initio estimates of 178\xe2\x88\x92190 and 177\xe2\x88\x92189 kcal/mol for the respective \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 anomers. Theoretical structures for the lowest-electronic-energy protonated species in the three hydroxymethyl conformations of each anomer are also presented to serve as reference data for postulating various kinetic pathways.

"The first systematic TRIR study of the photolysis of M(CO)6 in supercritical Ar, Kr, Xe, and CO2 permits the observation of M(CO)5L (M = Cr, Mo, and W; L = Ar (W only), Kr, Xe, and CO2). The second-order rate constants for the reaction of M(CO)5L with CO have been evaluated and the reactivity for each metal is Kr > Xe \xe2\x89\x88 CO2. For M(CO)5Kr, M(CO)5Xe, or M(CO)5(CO2) the reactivity is Cr \xe2\x89\x88 Mo > W. In supercritical Kr doped with either Xe or CO2, the M(CO)5 moiety interacts with Xe or CO2 in preference to Kr. The effect of solvent density on the rate of the reaction of W(CO)5(CO2) with CO has been investigated. This is the first time that the density dependence of any dissociative reaction has been followed in this way in supercritical solution. Our observations demonstrate that the reaction of W(CO)5(CO2) with CO in scCO2 is predominantly a dissociative process. The activation energies for the reaction of W(CO)5Xe and W(CO)5(CO2) with CO and the relative wavelength of the visible absorption maxima for Cr(CO)5Xe and Cr(CO)5(CO2) all indicate a similar strength of interaction for Xe and CO2 with the M(CO)5 moiety.

"Experimental momentum profiles (orbital images) corresponding to the electron density distribution in the outer valence shell of gaseous glycine have been obtained by electron momentum spectroscopy measurements conducted over the binding energy range of 6\xe2\x88\x9227 eV at an impact energy of 1200 eV + binding energy. The experimental data are compared with theoretical momentum profiles calculated using Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock and Kohn\xe2\x88\x92Sham density functional theories. The calculated momentum profiles correspond to a Boltzmann weighted sum of the five dominant conformers predicted to be present at the experimental temperature of 165 \xc2\xb0C. The importance of basis set size and flexibility is investigated in the case of the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock results by performing calculations using a series of basis sets ranging from minimal (STO-3G) to the near-Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock limit (aug-cc-pVTZ). The sensitivity of the density functional theory calculations to the type of exchange-correlation potential energy functional is investigated by comparing results using the local density approximation with those obtained with nonlocal functionals proposed by Becke, Perdew, and Lee, Yang, and Parr. It is found that the experimental results are generally best modeled by the density functional theory calculations, with only small differences noted among the results obtained using the different potential energy functionals. In the case of the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock calculations, increasing the basis set size beyond that of the 6-311++G** basis set has no discernible effect on the calculated momentum profiles, which in comparison to the experimental momentum profiles tend to underestimate the intensity at low values of electron momentum, particularly for the outermost valence orbitals of glycine. This suggests that a consideration of electron correlation effects is necessary for correct modeling of the chemically sensitive outer spatial regions of the electron density of the outer valence orbitals of glycine. "
"A combination of nonlocal density functional calculations and the Poisson\xe2\x88\x92Boltzmann method for the evaluation of free energies of hydration has been used to evaluate the electrode potential of [Co(NH3)6]3+ and [Co(en)3]3+ (where en = H2NCH2CH2NH2) using [Co(dien)2]3+ as a reference (where dien = H2NCH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH2). For [Co(en)3]3+, the electrode potential has been calculated to within 61 mV of the experimental value. For [Co(NH3)6]3+, the electrode potential is reproduced to within about 300 mV of experiment. The geometries of the complexes were optimized using the local spin density (LSD) method, with a LSD-optimized double-\xce\xb6 plus polarization Gaussian basis set. Single-point nonlocal calculations were carried out at the optimized geometry using the Becke and Perdew combination of functionals for exchange and correlation to obtain both the energies and potential-derived charges. The potential-derived charges were used in the Poisson\xe2\x88\x92Boltzmann calculations. The variation of the electrode potential of [Co(en)3]3+ with ionic strength is reproduced well. The suitability of the Poisson\xe2\x88\x92Boltzmann method for treating hydration in these systems is critically assessed in light of the agreement between theory and experiment. "
"We present a density functional study of the benzannulation reaction of heteroatom-stabilized chromium pentacarbonyl carbene complexes with ethyne. According to our calculations, the benzannulation is, independent of the detailed mechanism, exothermic both for hydroxy- and amino-substituted phenyl- and vinylcarbene compounds. The benzannulation starts with a dissociation of the cis-CO molecule closest to the \xcf\x80-system within the carbene ligand and a subsequent ethyne coordination, producing highly energetic \xce\xb72-ethyne\xe2\x88\x92carbene complex intermediates. The following ethyne\xe2\x88\x92carbene coupling, leading to \xce\xb73-allylidene complex intermediates, explains the observed regioselectivity of the benzannulation. The next step is a CO insertion. In the case of phenylcarbene educts, \xce\xb74-vinylketene complex intermediates are formed, which react to \xce\xb74-cyclohexadienone complexes by ring closure, whereas in reactions of vinylcarbene educts, the CO insertion produces \xce\xb74-cyclohexadienone complexes without any further barrier of activation. \xce\xb74-Vinylketene complexes are the most stable, but only weakly exothermic, intermediates along the naphthol formation and \xce\xb74-cyclohexadienone complexes are the most stable and strongly exothermic intermediates in the phenol formation. This has remarkable experimental consequences:\xe2\x80\x89 formation of six-membered rings should rarely be observed for ortho-disubstituted phenylcarbene chromium educts, whereas vinylcarbene compounds should generally produce six-membered rings. All reaction steps except the rate-determining cis-CO dissociation are characterized throughout by a pronounced template character and low-energy barriers. We find that the exchange of a cis-CO with a \xcf\x83-electron-donating solvent molecule is significantly less endothermic for metal hydroxycarbene than for aminocarbene. This explains the experimentally observed higher reaction temperature needed for the reaction of aminocarbene compared to hydroxycarbene compounds. Only in the case of tetracarbonyl vinylcarbene complexes is an intramolecular saturation of the vacant ligand site, forming \xce\xb73-allylidene complexes, an alternative to an intermediate coordination of a solvent molecule. "
"High-level ab initio calculations on silatropylium (1-Si) and silabenzyl (2-Si) cations and seven of their low-lying isomers (3\xe2\x88\x928), as well as on their carbon analogues, tropylium (1-C) and benzyl (2-C) cations, are reported. Heats of formation have been calculated at the G2(MP2) level of theory with the help of isodesmic and isogyric reactions. Relative stabilities and hydride affinities are reported using G2(MP2), G2(MP2,SVP), and density functional theory (B3-LYP, B-LYP, and B3-P86) procedures. The calculations confirm the experimental finding that tropylium cation is lower in energy than benzyl cation. The calculated heat of formation for benzyl cation (\xce\x94Hf\xe2\x80\x89298 = 907 kJ mol-1) is in good agreement with a value derived from recent experimental data but the calculated heat of formation for tropylium cation (\xce\x94Hf\xe2\x80\x89298 = 878 kJ mol-1) suggests that an experimental re-examination would be desirable. The stability ordering is reversed for the silicon analogues, silatropylium cation (1-Si, \xce\x94Hf\xe2\x80\x89298 = 980 kJ mol-1) and silabenzyl cation (2-Si, \xce\x94Hf\xe2\x80\x89298 = 942 kJ mol-1), with the latter lying lower in energy by 38 kJ mol-1. Among the isomers that we have examined, the lowest in energy by a considerable margin is (\xce\xb75-methylcyclopentadienyl)silanium cation (8, \xce\x94Hf\xe2\x80\x89298 = 839 kJ mol-1). Two other isomers, \xce\xb4-silabenzyl cation (3, \xce\x94Hf\xe2\x80\x89298 = 969 kJ mol-1) and (\xce\xb75-cyclohexadienyl)silanium cation (7, \xce\x94Hf\xe2\x80\x89298 = 965 kJ mol-1), lie intermediate in energy between 2-Si and 1-Si. The implications of our theoretical findings with regard to recent experimental results on the relative stabilities and hydride affinities of the C6SiH7+ isomers in the gas-phase chemistry of silatoluene radical cation are discussed. Our calculated relative energies and hydride affinities suggest 8 as the most likely prospect for the second C6SiH7+ isomer (in addition to 2-Si) observed experimentally. "
"Ab initio molecular orbital calculations have been carried out on a series of adducts between chlorine atom and NH3, NMe3, NCl3, HNCH2, and pyridine, and between methyl radical and HNCH2 and pyridine. A two-center\xe2\x88\x92three-electron (2c\xe2\x88\x923e) bond is predicted for all the chlorine adducts, whereas the CH3 adducts with the unsaturated systems form two-center\xe2\x88\x92two-electron (2c\xe2\x88\x922e) bonds following promotion of one of the nitrogen lone pair electrons into a \xcf\x80* orbital. For chlorine adducts, the greater strength of the 2c\xe2\x88\x922e N\xe2\x88\x92Cl bond compared with the 2c\xe2\x88\x923e N\xe2\x88\x92Cl bond is not sufficient to compensate for the required promotion energy in both the saturated and unsaturated amines. On the other hand, for CH3 adducts of the unsaturated nitrogen bases, HNCH2 and pyridine, the C\xe2\x88\x92N and C\xe2\x88\x92C bond energies are sufficiently high and the promotion energy is sufficiently low that adducts to both N and C with 2c\xe2\x88\x922e bonds can be formed. Adducts between CH3 and saturated nitrogen centers are less stable than the separated species because of the inability of CH3 to form effective 2c\xe2\x88\x923e bonds in neutral systems (due to its low electron affinity), and because of the high excitation energy required to promote an electron from the nitrogen lone pair (due to the absence of suitable low-lying empty orbitals in these systems).

"The E2 reactions of methyl- and fluoro-substituted ethyl chlorides with CH3-, NH2-, OH-, F-, SH-, and Cl- have been investigated at the MP2/6-31+G(d) level of theory for probing whether kinetic isotope effects are related to the geometry of the transition stucture. The primary kinetic isotope effects only display the expected maximum for the most symmetric transition structure when corrections for equilibrium isotope effects are taken into account. Such corrections are in general not possible from experimental data alone. Secondary kinetic isotope effects at the CH2Cl end of ethyl chloride correlate qualitatively with the carbon hybridization, although a quantitative relationship is lacking, even for closely related systems. The corresponding isotope effects at the carbon where a hydrogen is abstracted show little correlation with the geometry of the transition state. "
"Peroxidases are oxidative metabolizing heme proteins that require hydrogen peroxide to be transformed to the catalytically active, compound I, species from the ferric resting state. Although a peroxide complex has been proposed as a key intermediate in this reaction, this intermediate is too transient to have thus far been definitively characterized. Results of previous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a peroxide complex with cytochrome C peroxidase (CCP) indicated that peroxide forms a stable complex and binds in a nonsymmetric, end-on mode in which the oxygen atoms systematically exchange places as ligands for the iron. These results provided support for a plausible pathway from the peroxide complex to compound I, involving the participation of nearby histidine and arginine residues. To further explore the reliability of this bonding description, we report here, for the first time, the use of ab initio methods to determine the optimized geometry and stability of a peroxide complex with a model heme peroxidase. Two stable minima were identified, with binding energies of 9.7 kcal/mol. In both of these complexes, the peroxide binds in an end-on mode but with alternative oxygen atoms as the Fe ligand. No minimum corresponding to a bridged structure could be found. The two end-on minima are connected by a low-energy ridge. These results provide confirmation of three mechanistically important characteristics found in the previous 300 K MD simulations of a peroxidase\xe2\x88\x92HOOH complex:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) formation of a stable peroxide complex, (ii) binding of peroxide in an asymmetric end-on mode, and (iii) dynamic interchange between the oxygen atoms that bind to the Fe, implying a small energy barrier between them. "
"The INDO/ROHF/CI quantum chemical method has been used to calculate the electronic structure and spectra of two candidate peroxide intermediates of model peroxidases. In the enzymatic cycle of this family of oxidative metabolizing heme proteins, hydrogen peroxide is required to transform the ferric resting state to the catalytically active, ferryl FeO, compound I species. While a peroxide complex has been proposed as a key intermediate in this reaction, this intermediate species is too transient to have thus far been definitively characterized. Electronic spectra observed prior to compound I formation during the reaction of H2O2 with both wild type and the R38L mutant of horseradish peroxidase C (HRP-C) have been attributed to this intermediate. There are, however, significant qualitative differences in these spectra in the 300\xe2\x88\x92450-nm region, with a \xe2\x80\x9chyper-Soret\xe2\x80\x9d observed in one and a normal Soret, not very different from the resting state, found in the other. In the absence of any additional information, it is not possible from these reported spectra alone to identify the species that give rise to them or to understand these differences. In order to identify the origin of these spectra and their differences, we have calculated the electronic structure and spectra of two possible forms of the peroxide intermediate of model peroxidases, one with a neutral peroxide and the other with an anionic form (OOH\xe2\x88\x92) as the heme Fe ligand. Formation of the anion is possible by proton transfer to a nearby histidine residue, already implicated in compound I formation. A comparison of the calculated spectra for these two transient species indicates them to be quite distinct. Comparisons of the two spectra with those experimentally observed suggest that the \xe2\x80\x9chyper-porphyrin\xe2\x80\x9d spectrum observed in the wild type (WT) HRP-C experiments originates from the OOH\xe2\x88\x92 form of this transient intermediate in a low-spin ground state, while the normal Soret observed in the R38L HRP-C mutant experiment originates from the neutral peroxide form in a high-spin ground state. Thus by relating species to spectra, and by examining the consistency of calculated and observed spectra, a plausible identification has been made of the transient intermediate species in the pathway from the resting state to compound I of peroxidases.

"The surprisingly high stability of the dioxirane CF2O2 (2), its unusual geometry, its infrared spectrum, and NMR chemical shifts are determined and analyzed on the basis of extended ab initio calculations including seven different methods and nine different basis sets. At the highest level of theory, the CCSD(T) approach has been used together with a cc-VTZ2P+f basis set, which leads to an accurate description of geometry and vibrational frequencies. Stabilizing CF,CF bond interactions add 19.5 kcal/mol and CF,CO bond interactions 12 kcal/mol to the stability of the dioxirane ring. The latter effect reduces ring strain from 32.8 (dioxirane) to 20.5 kcal/mol (2) where 17 kcal/mol are due to CO bond strengthening and 4.6 kcal/mol to OO bond weakening. Changes in CO and OO bond strength are caused by a transfer of negative charge from the CF2 group to the antisymmetric Walsh MO of the ring. The calculated \xce\x94Hf\xc2\xb0(298) value of 2 is \xe2\x88\x92102 \xc2\xb1 1.5 kcal/mol, which indicates that 2 is thermodynamically rather stable. Calculated 13C (133 ppm) and 17O NMR chemical shifts (403 ppm) are unusually positive for an organic cyclic peroxide, but should facilitate the identification of 2 in the presence of its isomers F2COO and FC(O)OF, which possess \xce\x94Hf\xc2\xb0(298) values of \xe2\x88\x9260 and \xe2\x88\x92104 kcal/mol, respectively.

" The electronic conductivity and electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) of thin, electropolymerized films of the fixed-site redox polymer poly[Ru(vbpy)3](PF6)2 (vbpy = 4-vinyl-4\xe2\x80\x98-methyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine) on Pt interdigitated array electrodes were examined for both solvent-swollen and dry films. In both cases emission arose from *Ru2+ produced via the electron-transfer reaction between Ru3+ and Ru1+ states within the film (Ru = Ru(vbpy)3). Dry films contained fixed concentration gradients of Ru3+, Ru2+, and Ru1+ states which were first introduced in an acetonitrile-swollen film via the constant potential oxidation and reduction of Ru2+ at opposing IDA fingers. The gradients were then immbolized by drying and cooling the film while retaining the inter-electrode bias (2.6 V). The resulting dried and cooled films responded rapidly to changes in voltage bias and exhibited diode-like characteristics, conducting and emitting light at biases \xe2\x89\xa52.6 V and undergoing a reverse bias breakdown current, unassociated with light emission, at ca. \xe2\x88\x925.5 V. At 0 \xc2\xb0C the optimum quantum efficiency of solid-state ECL emission (\xcf\x86ECL) was similar to that in solvent-swollen films:\xe2\x80\x89 0.0003 photon/electron. In contrast to the dry films, solvent-swollen films were slow to respond to changes in voltage bias and did not exhibit diode-like behavior. "
"The primary solvation sphere surrounding the thiocyanate or the selenocyanide anion in protic solvents, such as methanol, N-methylformamide and formamide, forms intimate hydrogen bonds with these anions. These interactions perturb the electron density and vibrational modes of these anions and can therefore be studied by NMR and infrared spectroscopies. In neat solutions, these solvents form hydrogen bonds to the nitrogen end along the molecular axis and nonaxially to the \xcf\x80 cloud of the C\xe2\x88\x92N bond, although a substantial proportion of the anions is not hydrogen bonded. In nitromethane solutions, the thiocyanate and selenocyanide anions form weak complexes with methanol and the amide solvents (K < 1 M-1), which is an order of magnitude smaller than that of OCN- with the same solvents, determined in our previous investigation of the cyanate anion. The remarkable differences in the solvation of these singly charged anions can be understood by theoretical calculations of their electrostatic potentials. "
"We describe the formation of a stable triplet-state oligoaniline di(cation radical) via a proton-triggered redox reaction between N,N\xe2\x80\x98-bis[4-(phenylamino)phenyl]-1,3-benzenediamine (1) and N,N\xe2\x80\x98-bis[4-(phenylimino)-cyclohexa-2,5-dienylidene]-1,3-benzenediamine (2). In this reaction 1 is oxidized, while protonated 2 is reduced, both yielding the same di(cation radical) 12\xe2\x80\xa22+. The di(cation radical) is characterized with UV/visisble/near-IR and ESR spectroscopy (D = 118 MHz; E \xe2\x89\x88 0 MHz). Variable-temperature ESR measurements are consistent with a triplet ground state for 12\xe2\x80\xa22+. The high stability of 12\xe2\x80\xa22+ under ambient conditions demonstrates that alternating meta and para oligoanilines are interesting building blocks for future polaronic ferromagnets. "
"Complete carbon-13 chemical shift tensors are measured in single crystals of methyl \xce\xb1-d-galactopyranoside monohydrate, methyl \xce\xb1-d-glucopyranoside, methyl \xce\xb1-d-mannopyranoside, methyl \xce\xb2-d-galactopyranoside, methyl \xce\xb2-d-glucopyranoside hemihydrate, and methyl \xce\xb2-d-xylopyranoside. The fits of the experimental data to the second-rank form of shift tensors reflect the accuracy of the measured tensors and yield standard deviations that range between 0.27 and 0.75 ppm. Ab initio gauge-invariant atomic orbital (GIAO) computations using the D-95 double-\xce\xb6 basis set are used to assign the experimental tensors to the carbons in the unit cell. The root-mean-square (rms) deviation of the diffraction-structure-based GIAO shieldings fitted to all of the experimental shifts is 4.99 ppm. By optimizing the ring and methyl proton positions with the Gaussian-92 program and repeating the GIAO computations, the root-mean-square deviation is reduced to 2.40 ppm. These results illustrate that complete 13C chemical shift tensors measured in single crystals and interpreted with quantum-chemical computations can be used to evaluate differences between crystal structures obtained with X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and structural optimization methods.

"Ab initio quantum mechanical methods were applied to examine M2(GaH)3 (M = Li, Na, K) compounds, which are models for the newly synthesized class of Ga3 three-membered-ring cyclogallene compounds. Basis sets of triple-\xce\xb6 plus double polarization augmented with diffuse functions (TZ2P+diffuse) quality were employed at the self-consistent field (SCF) and density functional theory (B3LYP) levels of theory. Computed equilibrium geometries, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and chemical shifts are reported. The experimental (X-ray) structures of cyclogallenes are in close agreement with theory. While Na2(GaH)3 possesses C3 symmetry (the deviation from C3h symmetry is very small), the remaining two compounds are C3h symmetric. The parent neutral three-membered-ring structure (GaH)3 is not stable as the imaginary vibrational frequencies of (GaH)3 lead to Ga\xe2\x88\x92Ga bond breaking. Upfield changes in the chemical shifts for the alkali metal atoms over and under the ring plane are taken as strong evidence for ring currents in the cyclogallene moiety. This finding and the large negative nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS) clearly support the proposed aromatic character of the title compounds. "
"Molecular activation by blackbody photons, first postulated in 1919 by Perrin, plays a dominant role in the unimolecular dissociation of large ions trapped at low pressure in a Fourier-transform mass spectrometer. Under readily achievable experimental conditions, molecular ions of the protein ubiquitin equilibrate with the blackbody radiation field inside the vacuum chamber. The internal energy of a population of these ions is given by a Boltzmann distribution. From the temperature dependence of unimolecular dissociation rate constants measured in the zero-pressure limit, Arrhenius activation parameters equal to those in the high-pressure limit are obtained.

"From comparisons of the differences in heats of vaporization of alcohols (ROH) and their analogous hydrocarbons (RCH3) which turned out to be 6.1 \xc2\xb1 0.1 kcal/mol at 298 K it was concluded that this difference represents the contribution of the hydrogen bond to the value of \xce\x94Hvap(alcohol, 298 K). It is further concluded that alcohols are self associated in pure liquids in cyclic clusters each of four alcohols. These conclusions are supported by extensive, earlier studies of PVT relations in vapors, heat capacities, and IR spectra in solutions. Group additivity tables of Ducros et al. are shown to be in excellent agreement with directly measured \xce\x94Hvap(298 K) for both alcohols and alkanes. Similar analysis of amines shows a much weaker H-bond with a lower limit of about 2.2 kcal/mol between amines so that amines exist mostly as monomers. Scattered data on diols of lesser accuracy suggest compact sandwich structures with the hydrocarbon tying together two cyclic tetramer rings of H-bonded oxygen atoms. "
"A novel DNA\xe2\x88\x92lipid complex is prepared by replacing sodium counter cations by cationic amphiphilic lipids (1). The DNA\xe2\x88\x92lipid complex is insoluble in aqueous solutions, but is soluble in most organic media such as benzene, ethanol, and chloroform. The DNA\xe2\x88\x92lipid complex was confirmed to form double helical strands even in organic media, and the internal conformation of DNA strands could be reversibly changed from B-form to C-form in the organic solution (CHCl3/EtOH = 4:1) by changing the water content. A self-standing, water-insoluble DNA\xe2\x88\x92lipid (1) film was prepared by casting from the organic solution and could be stretched to produce oriented DNA strands with their axes aligned along the stretching direction. The film can be impregnated with the drug ethidium bromide in the aqueous solution. The linear dichroism characteristics of the drug\xe2\x88\x92DNA film show that the DNA strands are well oriented and the ethidium molecules are intercalated, as they are in normal aqueous solutions.

"The DNA repair enzyme MutY plays an important role in the prevention of DNA mutations caused by the oxidatively damaged lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine (OG) by removal of misincorporated adenine residues in OG:A mismatched base pairs using N-glycosylase activity. MutY also has glycosylase activity toward adenine in the mismatched base-pairs G:A and C:A. We have investigated the interaction of MutY with DNA duplexes containing the 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyadenosine (A) analogs 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxytubercidin (7-deaza-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyadenosine, Z) and 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyformycin A (F). Both F and Z should effectively mimic the recognition properties of A but be resistant to the glycosylase activity of MutY, owing to their structural properties. Thus, these derivatives will provide a method for forming a stable MutY\xe2\x88\x92substrate analog complex amenable to structural and biochemical investigation. We find that oligonucleotide duplexes containing OG/G:F and OG/G:Z base-pairs are not substrates for MutY as expected. Using a gel retardation method to measure relevant Kd values, we determined that MutY has an increased association with duplexes containing OG/G:F and OG/G:Z base-pairs over their OG/G:C counterparts. Interestingly, MutY has a higher affinity for the F-containing duplexes than the Z counterparts. Additionally, MutY binds to the OG:F and G:F duplexes with a similar, albeit lower, affinity as the substrate OG:A and G:A duplexes. In footprinting experiments using methidiumpropyl-EDTA\xe2\x88\x92Fe(II), a region of the duplex surrounding the OG:F base-pair is observed which is protected by MutY from hydroxyl radical cleavage. These results provide additional evidence for specific recognition of the OG:F base-pair within the DNA duplex. Furthermore, these results also illustrate the utility of OG:F duplexes for providing information regarding the MutY-mismatched DNA complex which could not be obtained with the normal OG:A substrate since a footprint on both strands of the duplex could only be observed with the OG:F-containing duplex. These substrate analog duplexes will provide avenues for structural analysis of the MutY-mismatched DNA complex and for investigating the properties of the unusual [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S] center in MutY.

"Isothermal titration calorimetry, UV melting, and competition dialysis techniques have been used to examine the binding of isomeric 1,4- and 2,6-bis(\xcf\x89-aminopropionamido)-substituted anthracene-9,10-diones (anthraquinones) with dAn\xc2\xb7dTn duplexes and dTn\xe2\x88\x92dAn\xc2\xb7dTn triplexes. Recent footprinting studies [Fox, K. R.; Polucci, P.; Jenkins, T. C.; Neidle, S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995, 92, 7887\xe2\x88\x927891] indicate that 2,6 derivatives, but not their 1,4 counterparts, differentially stabilize triple-stranded DNA and may have application in antigene chemotherapy. Thermodynamic investigations are here reported for interaction with dA18\xc2\xb7dT18 and dT18\xe2\x88\x92dA18\xc2\xb7dT18. The 2,6 compound shows preferential triplex binding, with Kb values of 1.8 \xc3\x97 104 M (duplex)-1 and 2.2 \xc3\x97 105 M (triplex)-1 at 25 \xc2\xb0C in aqueous solution, pH 6.0, whereas the 1,4 isomer favors duplex binding, with Kb values of 1.1 \xc3\x97 105 M (duplex)-1 and 3.5 \xc3\x97 104 M (triplex)-1. Binding to the preferred DNA is enthalpically driven for each ligand, whereas binding to the disfavored DNA is either entropically driven or enthalpy/entropy compensated. Further, the binding site sizes (3.6 base pairs/base triplets) suggest DNA intercalation. Competition dialysis studies with poly(dA)\xc2\xb7poly(dT) and poly(dA)\xc2\xb7poly(dT)2 confirm these binding preferences, and qualitative support is provided from UV melting experiments. Such studies reveal triplex disruption by the 1,4 isomer at low drug concentrations while the 2,6 compound effects stabilization toward thermal triplex denaturation. Spectrophotometric studies of each free ligand indicate self-association in aqueous solution, with dimerization constants at 25 \xc2\xb0C of (2.9 \xc2\xb1 0.2) \xc3\x97 103 and (3.2 \xc2\xb1 0.1) \xc3\x97 103 M-1 respectively for the 1,4 and 2,6 isomers. Taken together, these data provide a firm thermodynamic basis for the contrasting duplex/triplex binding preferences of this isomeric family of ligands. "
"Adipocyte lipid binding protein (ALBP) is a small 131 residue protein with a simple architecture that consists of two orthogonal planes of \xce\xb2-sheet secondary structure. This protein binds a variety of fatty acids in a large cavity formed between the two sheets such that the bound ligands are completely enclosed within the protein. In this paper, the synthesis of an ALBP conjugate (ALBP-PX) containing a pyridoxamine cofactor attached to a thiol within the protein interior is described. The conjugate was characterized by mass spectrometry, UV/vis spectroscopy, and gel filtration chromatography. ALBP-PX reductively aminates a number of alkyl, aryl, and side chain functionalized \xce\xb1-keto acids to \xce\xb1-amino acids with enantioselectivities as high as 94% ee. "
"6Li, 15N, and 13C NMR spectroscopic investigations of [6Li,15N]lithium hexamethyldisilazide ([6Li,15N]LiHMDS) coordinated by 29 polyamines, polyethers, and aminoethers reveal a range of structural types including \xce\xb71-coordinated mono- and disolvated dimers, \xce\xb72-coordinated (3-coordinate) monomers, \xce\xb71,\xce\xb72-coordinated (4-coordinate) monomers, \xce\xb72,\xce\xb72-coordinated (5-coordinate) monomers, polymers (linked dimers), triple ions, and solvent-separated ion pairs. Ligand binding constants on the LiHMDS monomers shed light on chelate ring size and steric effects, aza- and oxaphilicity, mechanisms and rates of ligand substitution, and the \xe2\x80\x9cmacrocyclic effect.\xe2\x80\x9d "
"We simulate self-reproducing micellar systems using a recently introduced lattice-gas automaton (Boghosian, B. M.; et al. A Lattice Gas Model of Microemulsions. Proc. R. Soc. London, A 1996, 452, 1221\xe2\x88\x921250). This dynamical model correctly describes the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of mixtures of oil, water, and surfactant. The simulations reported here mimic the experiments of Bachmann et al. (Nature 1992, 357, 57\xe2\x88\x9259) in which caprylate micelles are formed by alkaline hydrolysis of immiscible ethyl caprylate ester. As in the laboratory experiments, we find an extended induction period during which the concentration of micelles remains small; thereafter, the ester is consumed very rapidly with concomitant production of micelles.

"Molecular modeling, 1H NMR, and CD were employed to study the structure and stability of collagen-like triple helices composed of Gly-Pro-Nleu repeats. The compounds studied include the acetyl analogs Ac-(Gly-Pro-Nleu)n-NH2 (where n = 1, 6, 9) and the KTA conjugates KTA-[Gly-(Gly-Pro-Nleu)n-NH2]3 (where n = 1, 3, 6, 9 and KTA denotes the Kemp triacid). The presence of collagen-like assembled structures was supported by a consistent set of experimental observations, including the appearance of a distinct set of resonances, low hydrogen exchange rates for Gly NH, KTA signal splitting, cooperative melting transition, and analysis of NOESY cross peaks. In this regard, the concept of ensemble interchain NOEs was introduced and used to establish the close packing of Gly, Pro, and Nleu residues in triple helices composed of Gly-Pro-Nleu repeats. In addition, the ensemble interchain NOEs gave insight into the puckering of the Pro ring and the conformations accessible to the Nleu side chain. The effect of the KTA template on triple helicity was studied and shown to consist in a net gain in the free energy of triple-helix formation, as also seen for Gly-Pro-Hyp sequences. This free energy gain led to the induction of an assembled collagen-like structure in the KTA conjugate containing six Gly-Pro-Nleu repeats per chain and to an increase in thermal stability of the compound containing nine Gly-Pro-Nleu repeats per chain.

"The tumor-promoting teleocidins and their core structure (\xe2\x88\x92)-indolactam-V (1) exist in two stable conformers in solution at room temperature. The cis amide assumes a twist conformation while the trans amide exists in a sofa form. In order to identify the biologically active conformation of the teleocidins, we have synthesized new twist-restricted analogues 5a and 6 based on an aza-Claisen rearrangement of (\xe2\x88\x92)-N13-desmethyl-N13-allylindolactam-V (3) and a sofa-restricted analogue, (\xe2\x88\x92)-5-methylindolactam-V (22). The activities of these new compounds were evaluated in three in vitro bioassays associated with in vivo tumor-promoting activity:\xe2\x80\x89 binding to the protein kinase C regulatory domain, induction of the Epstein\xe2\x88\x92Barr virus early antigen, and stimulation of radioactive inorganic phosphate incorporation into phospholipids of HeLa cells. These three biological activities correlated well for each derivative. Twist-restricted analogues 5a and 6 showed significant activities in the three assays, comparable to 1 itself. In contrast, sofa-restricted 22 showed little activity related to tumor promotion. Introduction of a prenyl group into position 7 or 18 of 5a and 6 significantly enhanced the activity while sofa-restricted (\xe2\x88\x92)-5-prenylindolactam-V (23) showed only very weak activity. These results indicate that the active conformation of the teleocidins and 1 is close to the twist form. This is the first evidence bearing on the active conformation of the teleocidins based on conformationally restricted analogues with an intact indolactam skeleton and is in accord with conclusions reported for benzolactams, analogues without the pyrrole moiety. This study also describes the synthesis of new biologically active compounds (26a, 26b, 28) based on inactive (+)-epiindolactam-V (24), involving a further application of the aza-Claisen rearrangement. Bridge formation between positions 5 and 13 of indolactam derivatives represents a particularly effective analogue design strategy, allowing for the remote control of the conformation of this ring system and for the introduction of a wide range of structural variations, as required for the development of new protein kinase C activators with high isozyme selectivity.

"Deoxyadenylic acid and deoxythymidilic acid have been attached to a covalently-linked cross section, dA dT, on the same side (proximal) and on opposite sides (distal) by synthetic sequences involving various combined protection/deprotection steps. The structures in aqueous solution buffered at pH 7.0 have been examined by 2D-NOESY NMR spectroscopy. The covalently-linked cross section provides a template that stabilizes dA\xc2\xb7dT base pairing in the proximal isomer at 2 \xc2\xb0C. In the distal isomer, it contributes to favorable conformations for intermolecular association. "
"Whole-cell biooxidation of bromobenzene with Pseudomonas putida 39D or the recombinant Escherichia coli JM109 (pDTG601) yields (1S,2S)-3-bromocyclohexa-3,5-diene-1,2-diol (9a), which is protected as the acetonide and converted to vinylaziridines 7, 15a, 63, and 64. Our route to (+)-pancratistatin features the coupling of a higher order cyanocuprate (derived by ortho-metalation from N,N-dimethyl-2-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-3,4-(methylenedioxy)benzamide) with aziridine 7 to generate 28, which contains the carbon framework of the title alkaloid. Functional group manipulations resulted in the preparation of epoxydiol 50, which was transformed in a unique fashion and under mild conditions (H2O/PhCO2Na) to (+)-pancratistatin, thus completing a concise synthesis of (+)-pancratistatin in 14 steps from bromobenzene (2% overall yield). To improve this first generation attempt, a new route was devised utilizing carbomethoxyaziridine 64 and its coupling to the cuprate of 3,4-(methylenedioxy)bromobenzene. The adduct was converted to (+)-7-deoxypancratistatin in a total of 11 steps from bromobenzene (3% overall yield), and the basis for further improvement toward a practical synthesis of pancratistatin-type alkaloids was formulated.

"The first total asymmetric synthesis of (+)-xestoquinone (1) has been accomplished in 68% ee by a palladium(0)-catalyzed polyene cyclization of naphthyl triflate 44 using (S)-(+)-BINAP as the chiral ligand. Attempts at an asymmetric polyene cyclization using the corresponding naphthyl bromide 41 gave poor enantioselectivities even in the presence of silver salts, thus exemplifying the effect of the coordination state of palladium on the enantioselectivity. A new method for the preparation of 6,7-dihydroisobenzofurans is also described using a [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement on a seven-membered cyclic ether precursor. "
"Rhodium(II) carboxylate catalyzed decomposition of vinyldiazomethanes in the presence of furans results in a general synthesis of oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octa-2,6-diene derivatives. These oxabicyclic products are versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. The mechanism of the [3 + 4] annulation is considered to be a tandem cyclopropanation/Cope rearrangement. Such a mechanism is consistent with the excellent regio- and stereocontrol that is observed in these [3 + 4] annulations. Asymmetric synthesis of the oxabicyclic products is possible through utilization of rhodium(II) (S)-N-(tert-butylbenzene)sulfonylprolinate as catalyst or by using (S)-lactate or (R)-pantolactone as chiral auxiliaries on the carbenoid. The highest yields (69\xe2\x88\x9295%) and asymmetric induction (82\xe2\x88\x9295% de) were obtained using 3-siloxy-2-diazo-3-butenoate derivatives as the vinylcarbenoid precursors. "
"On heating in refluxing benzene, acyclic enyne\xe2\x88\x92allene 4 underwent intramolecular transformations in a sequence with an initial Myers cycloaromatization to form \xce\xb1,3-didehydrotoluene biradical 5 followed by a 5-exo cyclization of the benzenoid radical center in 5 to produce 6. Biradical 6 then decayed through a 1,5-hydrogen shift to furnish o-quinodimethane 7, which in turn was captured in an intramolecular Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reaction to afford 8 having the tetracyclic steroidal skeleton in a single step from 4 in 50% isolated yield. Similarly, acyclic enyne\xe2\x88\x92allene 16 having one of the tethers shortened by one carbon atom furnished 18 having the fused 5,6,6,5-ring system. Tetracycle 19 substituted with an angular methyl group was obtained from 17. In the cases of 24 and 34, a predominant 1,5-hydrogen shift of an allylic hydrogen to the benzenoid radical center of biradicals 26 and 35 followed by a homolytic coupling produced spiro derivatives 31 and 40, respectively. On the other hand, a preferential 7-endo ring closure of biradicals 41 and 49, derived from 25 and 48, gave predominantly the tricyclic derivatives 46 and 54, respectively. Similarly, cascade radical cyclizations via biradicals generated from enyne\xe2\x88\x92allenes 67\xe2\x88\x9270 produced the bicyclic spiro compounds 77\xe2\x88\x9280 having a four-membered ring. "
"The syntheses, properties, and characterization of several new complexes, Re(CNtBu)3(PCy3)2H (1a), Re(CNtBu)3(PR3)2Cl [R = Cy, Ph (2a, 2b)], the 17-electron [Re(CNtBu)3(PCy3)2Cl]+ (3a), the dihydrogen complex, [Re(CNtBu)3(PR3)2(H2)]+ [R = Cy, Ph (4a, 4b)], the coordinatively unsaturated [Re(CNtBu)3(PCy3)2]+ (5a), and [Re(CNtBu)4(PCy3)2]+ (6a) are reported. In addition, spectroscopic evidence for the dinitrogen complex [Re(CNtBu)3(PCy3)2(N2)]+ and the dihydrogen complex [Re(CNtBu)5(H2)]+ is presented. Thermodynamic parameters have been obtained for the equilibrium system, Re(CNtBu)3(PCy3)2Cl (2a) + H2 \xe2\x87\x8c [Re(CNtBu)3(PCy3)2(H2)]Cl (4a). 1H and 31P{1H} NMR studies (CD2Cl2) over the temperature range 286\xe2\x88\x92316 K afford values of \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 = \xe2\x88\x9218.0 \xc2\xb1 0.7 kcal/mol, \xce\x94S\xc2\xb0 = \xe2\x88\x9244 \xc2\xb1 2 eu, and \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0298 = \xe2\x88\x924.8 \xc2\xb1 1.3 kcal/mol for this equilibrium. The complexes 4a and 4b are characterized as dihydrogen complexes. Their JHD (R = Cy, 30.3 Hz; R = Ph, 30.9 Hz) and T1(min) values of 8 ms (300 MHz) are consistent with H\xe2\x88\x92H distances of ca. 0.80 \xc3\x85. [Re(CNtBu)5(HD)]+ is also characterized as a dihydrogen complex based on a JHD of 33.4 Hz. This complex could not be isolated at room temperature, even with non-coordinating counteranions, due to the lability of the H2 ligand. [Re(PMe3)5HD]+ shows no H\xe2\x88\x92D coupling and is characterized as a dihydride complex. The unsaturated complex [Re(CNtBu)3(PCy3)2]+ (5a) is found to undergo a dynamic isonitrile rearrangement on the NMR time scale. 1H NMR spin saturation transfer studies over a temperature range of 254\xe2\x88\x92297 K afford the activation parameters \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 11.4 \xc2\xb1 0.8 kcal/mol, \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9217.6 \xc2\xb1 1.6 eu, and \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7298 = 16.6 \xc2\xb1 1.2 kcal/mol.

"Pyridones tethered by a four-carbon chain at the 3- and 6\xe2\x80\x99-positions can undergo [4 + 4] photocycloaddition to simultaneously form three, but not four, tetrasubstituted carbons. In a study directed at the taxanes, photocycloaddition of 28 was found to be fully controlled by a (tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy group on the tether, to give a photoproduct with five stereogenic centers and both quaternary carbons found in taxol (paclitaxel). This photoproduct proved to be unstable to silica gel, but saturation of one alkene gave a stable product (30). Epoxidation of the enol ether of 30 proceeds exclusively from one face of the cyclooctene ring, demonstrating the facial bias of the polycyclic system and correctly introducing the C-2 stereogenic center of taxol. As part of this study, 4-methoxy-2-pyridones, known to be inert to [4 + 4] photodimerization, were found to undergo [4 + 4] photocycloaddition with 4-unsubstituted-2-pyridones both inter- and intramolecularly.

"Two pathways have been observed for Cr(V)-mediated nucleotide oxidation in reactions of bis(2-ethyl-2-hydroxybutyrato)oxochromate(V) [CrO(ehba)2]- with thymidine nucleotides dTMP, dTDP, and dTTP. The extent of Cr(V)-induced nucleotide oxidation was greatest for thymidine diphosphate (dTDP), as measured by the production of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS; indicative of pathway 1) and thymine release (indicative of pathway 2). The nucleoside thymidine showed no reaction, suggesting a phosphate-dependent oxidation. Amounts of TBARS and thymine were maximal at a pH range of 6.0\xe2\x88\x926.5, and both TBARS formation and thymine release correlated with decay of the Cr(V) EPR signal. Formation of TBARS was maximal in 100% O2 but decreased markedly under argon, whereas thymine release was maximal under argon, but remained the major product observed under aerobic conditions. Pathway 1 for the reaction of Cr(V) with dTDP led to formation of glycolic acid and trans-thymine propenal at approximately equimolar amounts, consistent with a mechanism involving oxygen-dependent sugar oxidation following hydrogen atom abstraction at the C-4\xe2\x80\x98 carbon of the deoxyribose sugar. Pathway 2 led to release of free thymine, but much less (barely detectable) 2-deoxy-d-pentitol was formed from postreduction of the reactive aldehydic sugar fragment. Thus, the oxygen-independent release of thymine does not appear to result from reaction at the C-4\xe2\x80\x98 hydrogen unless decomposition of the aldehydic intermediate occurred. Determination of the oxidation state of chromium responsible for the observed oxidative damage was carried out using Mn(II), a Cr(IV)-specific reductant. Mn(II) essentially abolished all activity for both TBARS formation (pathway 1) and thymine release (pathway 2). These results suggest that Cr(IV), formed upon disproportionation of Cr(V), oxidizes the nucleotide deoxyribose sugar moiety via a phosphate-bound intermediate. Pathway 1 involves oxygen-dependent oxidation at the C-4\xe2\x80\x98 position; however, the mechanism for oxygen-independent thymine release (pathway 2) is still unclear. "
"The homolytic bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the O\xe2\x88\x92H bonds in DMSO solution for (a) phenol and a number of its derivatives, (b) three oximes, (c) three alcohols, (d) three hydroxylamines, and (e) two hydroxamic acids have been estimated by eq 1:\xe2\x80\x89 BDEHA = 1.37pKHA + 23.1Eox(A-) + 73.3 kcal/mol. For most of these hydroxylic acids, the BDEs of the O\xe2\x88\x92H bonds estimated by eq 1 are within \xc2\xb12 kcal/mol of the literature values in nonpolar solvents or in the gas phase. There is no reason to believe, therefore, that these BDEs are \xe2\x80\x9cseriously in error because of failure to correct for solvent effects\xe2\x80\x9d as has been claimed on the basis that BDEs in highly polar solvents estimated for the O\xe2\x88\x92H bond in phenol by photoacoustic calorimetry must be so corrected.

"The reaction of tert-butyl peroxypivalate (2) with methyl methacrylate (3) has been studied by the radical trapping technique employing 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-2-yloxyl (1) as a scavenger. Thermolysis of 2 generated tert-butoxyl, tert-butyl, and methyl radicals in the ratios of 48:50:2 at 60 \xc2\xb0C in 3. Both alkyl radicals underwent selective tail addition to 3. tert-Butyl radicals reacted about twice as fast as methyl radicals with 3. The absolute rate constant for addition of tert-butyl radicals to 3 was estimated to be 2.3 \xc3\x97 106 M-1 s-1 at 60 \xc2\xb0C. The overall ratio of addition to H abstraction in the reaction of 2 with 3 was 5:1. "
"The kinetics and products of reaction of a distorted bicyclic anilide (1, 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2-oxo-1,5-ethanobenzazepine) with 2-mercaptoacetic acid (2, thioglycolic acid) and ethyl 2-mercaptoacetate (3) have been studied in H2O at 25 \xc2\xb0C. In both cases the products are the corresponding thio esters. For 2, the pH rate profile shows an apparent plateau from pH 2 to 9, followed by a linear decrease in rate with pH above the second pKa of thioglycolic acid (10.22). For 3, the pH rate profile shows a plateau at low pH with a domain of linear decrease in rate with pH above the pKa of 8. For 3 the reaction mechanism involves attack of the monoanion (3-S-) on the protonated amide (1-H+) throughout the entire pH region investigated. The same obtains for 2 below pH 3.5, with an additional efficient pathway involving the attack of 2-S- on neutral 1 at pH >3.5. In the latter case, in the neutral pH domain, the reaction of the thiolate of 2-S- with 1 is promoted by an intramolecular proton transfer from the pendant COOH which traps the unstable tetrahedral intermediate, thereby preventing reversal to starting materials. It is also observed that N-methylimidazole acts as a nucleophilic catalyst, reversibly reacting with 1 to form a transient N-acylimidazolium ion that is subsequently rapidly captured by both 3-S- and 2-S- to form their corresponding thio esters. The mechanism of these processes is discussed in the light of the attack of other bifunctional nucleophiles. "
"The acyltrimethylsilanes 4-RC6H4C(O)SiMe3 (R = H, Me, MeO) and \xce\xb2-naphthylC(O)SiMe3, upon photolysis in acetonitrile with 20 ns pulses of 248 nm light from an KrF* excimer laser, give rise to the corresponding \xce\xb1-siloxycarbenes ArC:OSiMe3, whose absorption spectra (\xce\xbbmax between 270 and 310 nm), lifetimes (between 130 and 260 ns), and reactivities with proton donors (ROH, mainly alcohols) are reported. With highly acidic ROH, such as 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP), the reaction is of simple second order, rate constants being in the 109 M-1 s-1 range and virtually independent of the nature of the aromatic moiety of the carbene. Isotopic substitution of H in ROH by D has no effect on the rate constant for reaction with carbene. For less acidic alcohols such as, e.g., methanol, the reactivity of the carbenes increases with increasing [ROH]. This behavior is interpreted in terms of reversible adduct formation between carbene and alcohol followed by reaction with further alcohol molecule(s) to give product. On the basis of experiments in the acidic and only weakly nucleophilic solvents 2,2,2-trifluorethanol (TFE) and HFIP, protonation of the carbenes leads to the corresponding carbenium ions, whose absorption spectra (\xce\xbbmax between 305 and 355 nm), lifetimes (100 ns\xe2\x88\x925 \xce\xbcs in TFE), and reactivities with nucleophiles (halides, alcohols, and ethers) are reported. In the solvent HFIP, the reactivities of the carbenium ions with the alcohols and ethers increase with their concentration, in a way analogous to that observed in the reaction of the carbenes with the alcohols. This is explained as resulting from reversible formation of a cation\xe2\x88\x92nucleophile complex followed by reaction of the complex with a second nucleophile molecule which acts as a base. In solvents more basic than HFIP, it is presumably the solvent which serves this function. "
"Two new sulfido complexes of tin have been prepared by the reaction of styrene sulfide with novel tin(II) amidinate complexes. These compounds exhibit two very different bonding modes for the sulfido ligand; in one case, SSn(CyNC(tBu)NCy)2 (3), a terminal SnS moiety was found while in the other case, [(CyNC(Me)NCy)2Sn(\xce\xbc-S)]2 (4), a bridging sulfido dimer is observed. The starting complexes were prepared by the reaction of 2 equiv of the appropriate lithium amidinate with SnCl2 to yield the new species Sn(CyNC(R)NCy)2 [Cy = cyclohexyl; R = Me (1); R = tBu (2)]. This account represents the first report of (CyNC(tBu)NCy)- and the coordination chemistry of this bulky ligand. Spectroscopic and elemental analyses confirmed the formulas of all of these new species. Compounds 2, 3, and 4 were further characterized by X-ray crystallography.

"A highly regioselective cyclohexadiene annulation to the CC(N) bond of an enamine is achieved in two steps involving the condensation of a 1-alkynylcarbene complex (CO)5MC(OEt)C\xe2\x8b\xaeCPh 1 (M = Cr, W) with an enolizable carbonyl compound (2,4-pentanedione, 3-oxobutyric acid ester, 2-tetralones, and 1,3-cyclopentanedione) to give a pyran-2-ylidene complex 3, 5, and 17, which on subsequent reaction with cyclic enamines 6, 9, 13, and 16, generate a 5-amino-1,3-cyclohexadiene by elimination of M(CO)6. Thus, bicyclic ring skeletons 7 and 10, steroid-like molecules 8, 18, and 19, and tetracyclic compounds 11, 12, and 15 are obtained mostly in good chemical yields and under mild conditions. Side reactions, such as base-induced self-condensation of 3 to give aryl pyran-2-ylidene complexes 20 become efficiently suppressed in hydrocarbon solvents. "
"The conformational behavior of the synthetic glycosidase inhibitor C-lactose (1) has been studied in different solvents (water, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, pyridine) using NMR spectroscopy and molecular mechanics calculations. The obtained results have been compared to those previously obtained for its natural analogue, methyl \xce\xb1-lactoside (2). It is shown that the conformational behavior of C- and O-lactoses is only similar around the glycosidic bond, but not around the aglyconic bond. In addition, the extent of flexibility around the \xce\xb2(1\xe2\x86\x924) linkage is much larger for C-lactose (1) than for methyl \xce\xb1-lactoside, about 23% of the complete potential energy surface of 1 is appreciably populated, and several energy minima coexist in solution. The obtained results indicate that \xce\xb2-linked C-glycosides are fairly flexible compounds and that even variations of the solvent may heavily affect their conformational behavior. Finally, we report on the use of 2D transferred NOE experiments to study the recognition of C-lactose and its \xce\xb2-methyl derivative (3) by a galactose-binding protein, ricin-B. We also compare the obtained results to those reported for the complexation of regular lactose analogues. The experimental results unambiguosly indicate that ricin-B selects different conformers of C-lactose (anti conformer) and its O-analogue (2) (syn conformer). "
"The effects of alkene pyramidalization on proton affinity (PA) were investigated, using the pyramidalized olefin tricyclo[3.3.3.03,7]undec-3(7)-ene (1), with bicyclo[3.3.0]oct-1(5)-ene (2) as a reference compound. The expectation that the relief of olefin strain energy associated with protonation of 1 will result in a substantially greater proton affinity for 1 compared with 2 was confirmed by ab initio calculations. This was also evident from measurements made by the kinetic method in which competitive dissociations of proton-bound cluster ions of the olefin of interest and a reference base were examined in an ion trap mass spectrometer. However, the ab initio calculations show a smaller PA difference (11.7 kcal/mol) between 1 and 2 than the experiments which yield a difference of 23 \xc2\xb1 2 kcal/mol. This discrepancy is reconciled by proposing that, in the experiments involving 1, protonation leads not to carbocation 1-H+ but to a rearranged carbocation. This type of isomerization was demonstrated experimentally by measurements of the PAs of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene (7) and 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene (10), and ab initio calculations indicate that the tertiary cyclopropylcarbinyl carbocation, 5, is considerably lower in energy than 1-H+. Cation 5 could be formed either directly from 1-H+ or by protonation of vinylcyclopropane 4, an isomer of 1 which could be formed under the conditions of the experiment. The most stable alkene that can be formed by deprotonation of 5 is the diene 6, which is calculated to have PA = 219.6 kcal/mol at the MP4SDQ/6-31G* level of theory. The difference of 20.7 kcal/mol between the calculated PAs of 2 and 6 is in good agreement with the measured difference \xce\x94PA = 23 \xc2\xb1 2 kcal/mol and thus supports the hypothesis that the experiments involving 1 have measured the PA corresponding to formation of carbocation 5.

"Picosecond absorption measurements of the trans isomers of 9-styrylanthracene (9-StAn), n-styrylnaphthalene (n-StN, with n = 1 and 2), and n-styrylphenanthrene (n-StPh, with n = 1, 2, and 9) were carried out in a number of solvents at room temperature. In all cases, a short-lived transient (with \xcf\x84S = 0.1 \xc3\xb7 0.8 ns) was produced monophotonically within the laser pulse. This transient, which absorbs in a wide wavelength range (400\xe2\x88\x92750 nm), was assigned to the S2 state. At longer delay time, the S1 \xe2\x86\x92 Sn absorption (with lifetime \xcf\x84L) replaced that of S2, its assignment being strongly supported by the comparison between \xcf\x84L and the fluorescence lifetime of these diarylethenes. The S1 \xe2\x86\x92 Sn absorption of two distinct rotamers was detected for 2-StN in solvents of different polarity, while for the other compounds only one longer-lived transient was detected. Complementary fluorimetric measurements by phase-modulation technique confirmed the presence of a second decay component in the picosecond region with a lifetime corresponding to the \xcf\x84S values measured by laser flash photolysis. The effect of temperature studied in both picosecond and nanosecond regions suggests that the S2 \xe2\x86\x92 S1 internal conversion is not the only decay pathway of S2. In particular, for 9-StAn, it is shown that both S1 and S2 are involved in the singlet\xe2\x88\x92triplet intersystem crossing, and, at least in the cases of 1-StN and 2-StPh, the S2 state (or both S1 and S2) is (are) involved in the trans \xe2\x86\x92 perp decay process. An investigation of the effect of excitation wavelength on the fluorescence and trans \xe2\x86\x92 cis photoisomerization quantum yields was found to support such hypothesis of the role played by upper excited states in the relaxation processes of some of the styrylarenes investigated.

"The electron transfer photoreaction between 9,10-dicyanoanthracene (DCA) and (E)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-ol (geraniol, (E)-1) in dichloromethane produces mainly cis-2-(2-propenyl)-trans-5-methylcyclopentanemethanol, cis,trans-3, whereas irradiation of acetonitrile solutions of 1,4-dicyanobenzene (DCB) and (E)-1 forms mainly two trans-fused 3-oxabicyclo[3.3.0]octanes (4, R = H; 5, R = p-C6H4CN). Analogous results are observed in the photoreaction of farnesol ((E,E)-2) with DCB in the presence of phenanthrene as cosensitizer. The photoreaction of DCB with 1 or 2 has sufficient driving force (\xce\x94G = \xe2\x88\x920.7 eV in acetonitrile) for the generation of solvent-separated radical ion pairs (SSRIPs); in contrast, the marginal driving force (\xce\x94G \xe2\x89\x88 0 eV) of the DCA sensitized reaction allows only the formation of contact radical ion pairs (CRIPs). The resulting radical cations react by five-center C\xe2\x88\x92C cyclization, yielding di-tertiary, 2,\xce\xb1-bifunctional methylidenecyclopentyl radical cations, cis- or trans-B\xe2\x80\xa2+. Subsequently, CRIPs undergo rapid back electron transfer and intramolecular hydrogen transfer, generating product 3. The radical cations, trans-B\xe2\x80\xa2+, of SSRIPs undergo a second cyclization by intramolecular nucleophilic capture, generating 3-oxabicyclo[3.3.0]oct-6-yl free radicals, trans-C\xe2\x80\xa2. "
"The electron transfer photochemistry of optically pure (1R,3S)-(+)-cis-chrysanthemol (cis-2) results in the formation of (R)-5-(1-(p-cyanophenyl)-1-methylethyl)-2,2-dimethyl oxacyclohex-3-ene (4) with significant retention of optical activity. The product is rationalized via nucleophilic attack of the alcoholic function of the radical cation on the terminal carbon of the vinyl group with simultaneous replacement of an isopropyl radical as an intramolecular leaving group in an apparent SN2\xe2\x80\x99 reaction. This mode of attack is unprecedented in vinylcyclopropane radical cations and is interpreted as evidence for the significant role that relief of ring strain and its avoidance play in determining the course of nucleophilic capture in radical cationic systems.

"A novel lipophilic zinc(II) complex with 1-hexadecyl-1,4,7,10-tetrazacyclododecane (hexadecylcyclen, L) has been synthesized, which is almost insoluble in water, but becomes soluble in the presence of Triton X-100 surfactant. Analysis of the potentiometric pH titration of ZnII\xe2\x88\x92hexadecylcyclen (1 mM) in the presence of Triton X-100 (10 mM) disclosed monodeprotonation of the ZnII-bound H2O, yielding an OH--bridged complex (ZnL)2OH- (pKd = \xe2\x88\x92log([(ZnL)2OH-]aH+/[ZnL]2) = 3.92 \xc2\xb1 0.05) and a monomeric ZnII\xe2\x88\x92OH- complex ZnL\xe2\x88\x92OH- (pKa = \xe2\x88\x92log([ZnL\xe2\x88\x92OH-]aH+/[ZnL]) = 7.56 \xc2\xb1 0.05) at 25 \xc2\xb0C with I = 0.10 (NaNO3). The zinc(II) complex (ZnL) possesses higher catalytic activity than the parent zinc(II) complex of 1,4,7,10-tetrazacyclododecane (cyclen, L\xe2\x80\x98) in hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl acetate (NA), bis(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNP-), and tris(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate (TNP) in aqueous comicellar solution with 10 mM Triton X-100. The NA hydrolysis activity of ZnII\xe2\x88\x92hexadecylcyclen increased with the pH and leveled off at pH > 10 and 25 \xc2\xb0C, from which the active species was estimated to be a ZnL\xe2\x88\x92OH- complex. The second-order rate (first-order in [NA] and [ZnL\xe2\x88\x92OH-]) of NA hydrolysis (kNA = 5.0 \xc2\xb1 0.2 M-1 s-1) in the presence of 10 mM Triton X-100 is 50 times greater than that with a reference ZnL\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92OH- in 10% (v/v) CH3CN aqueous solution. Hydrolysis of TNP in 10% (v/v) MeOH aqueous solution with ZnL\xe2\x88\x92OH- and 10 mM Triton X-100 (kTNP = (1.1 \xc2\xb1 0.1) \xc3\x97 103 M-1 s-1) is 290 times more efficient than with ZnL\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92OH- (3.8 \xc2\xb1 0.2 M-1 s-1) at 25 \xc2\xb0C. The higher effective molarity of the lipophilic substrate coexisting with ZnL\xe2\x88\x92OH- in the micelles accounts for the extraordinary catalytic activity. From comparison with previously reported metal catalysts, the present lipophilic zinc(II) complex with hexadecylcyclen is probably one of the best candidate catalyst for detoxification of poisonous phosphotriesters.

"Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are flavoproteins that catalyze the conversion of a fatty acyl thioester substrate to the corresponding \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-enoyl-CoA product. It has been well established that a glutamate residue in the active site [e.g., E367 in short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) of Megasphaera elsdenii] is responsible for the initial \xce\xb1-proton abstraction. Early studies have also shown that this class of enzymes is capable of catalyzing \xce\xb3-H abstraction to afford the allylic isomerization between \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2- and \xce\xb2,\xce\xb3-enone thioesters and/or inactivation by 2- or 3-acetylenic acyl-CoA derivatives. Although a dual role has been proposed for the glutamate residue in both \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb3-deprotonation, the existence of a second active-site basic group to mediate the observed reactions occurring at \xce\xb3-C remains a feasible mechanism. In an attempt to discern between these two possibilities, we have prepared a few oxirane-containing acyl-CoA derivatives aimed at trapping active-site bases in the vicinity of the \xce\xb1- and/or \xce\xb3-C. It was found that 2,3-epoxybutyryl-CoA is a new class-selective irreversible inactivator against SCAD; however, the inability of other oxirane-containing probes to react with these enzymes prompted us to tackle this mechanistic problem by directly studying the role of Glu-367 in SCAD-catalyzed 1,3-isomerization. The effect of E367Q mutation on the proficiency of SCAD to mediate the \xce\xb3-H exchange of crotonoyl-CoA was examined. The capabilities of the wild-type SCAD and its E367Q mutant to catalyze the \xce\xb3-H abstraction during the inactivation by 2-butynoyl-CoA was also compared. The fact that the mutant protein fails to promote \xce\xb3-H exchange/abstraction provides strong evidence supporting a one-base mechanism of this enzyme-catalyzed allylic isomerization. Since the catalysis of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases is closely related, such a one-base mechanism is expected to be conserved within this family of enzymes. "
"Fluorophore\xe2\x88\x92amino acid\xe2\x88\x92cyclodextrin (CD) triad systems, N-dansyl-l-leucine-modified and N-dansyl-d-leucine-modified \xce\xb2-CD (1, 2) and N-dansyl-l-leucine-modified and N-dansyl-d-leucine-modified \xce\xb3-CD (3, 4), were synthesized and characterized as fluorescent indicators of molecular recognition. Fluorescence decay analyses of these CD derivatives indicated that there exist two lifetime components, being in equilibrium with each other in aqueous solution, with the dansyl moiety included in its own cavity (self-inclusion) for the larger lifetime component while located outside the cavity for the shorter lifetime one. The structural analyses of \xce\xb2-CD derivatives 1 and 2 undertaken by combined use of 1D and 2D NMR spectra indicate that the dansyl moiety of 2 is more deeply included in the CD cavity than that of 1. The leucine residue between the dansyl and the CD moieties of these hosts was more effective in enhancing the binding abilities for various guests when compared with the glycine residue of the corresponding hosts. The difference in the enantiomeric configuration of the leucine residue caused the difference in the binding constants with larger values for 1 than 2 and with the opposite trend for the \xce\xb3-CD derivatives 3 and 4. Upon guest addition, the fluorescence intensities of 1 and 2 decreased, reflecting the exclusion of the dansyl moiety from inside to outside of the \xce\xb2-CD cavity, while the fluorescence intensities of the \xce\xb3-CD derivatives 3 and 4 depended on the guest as shown by the increase induced by cyclohexanol and the decrease by (\xe2\x88\x92)-borneol and other larger guests. These guest-responsive variations of the fluorescence intensity enabled these hosts to be used as effective fluorescent indicators of molecular recognition. "
"Molecular dynamics simulations were used to model the response of several double-stranded dodecamers to gradually increasing tension applied to the opposing 3\xe2\x80\x98 ends of the two polynucleotide strands. At forces between 0.80 and 1.45 nN, depending on sequence, the strands separated completely. The separation force for one of the dodecamers studied has been measured and is close to that seen in the simulation. Before strand separation, at forces between 0.065 and 0.090 nN, again depending on sequence, there was an abrupt extension and transition to a novel ladder structure in which bases of one strand were stacked on those of the other strand. Sudden extensions have been observed in very long DNA molecules at forces similar to those seen in the simulations. After the abrupt extension but before strand separation, the ladder structure became more regular, and the phosphate backbones became more linear. Throughout the entire molecular extension, most hydrogen-bonded base pairs remained intact. "
"The reaction of 3-methyl-1,2,3-oxadiazolinium tosylate 10, a close model for a putative reactive intermediate in the carcinogenic activation of ethanol nitrosamines such as (2-hydroxyethyl)methylnitrosamine 1, with various guanine derivatives, including acycloguanosine 12, deoxyguanosine, deoxyguanosine monophosphate, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate, various DNA oligomers, and calf-thymus DNA has been examined to determine whether this compound methylates and hydroxyethylates guanine residues as proposed. In all of the transformations, 7-(2-(methylnitrosamino)ethyl)guanine (14) is the major product, following acidic hydrolysis, and exceeds the formation of 7-methylguanine by ratios ranging from 4:1 to 48:1, depending upon the guanine bearing substrate. O6-(2-(Methylnitrosamino)ethyl)deoxyguanosine (20) was prepared from the Mitsunobu coupling of 1 and a protected deoxyguanosine derivative. 20 is not produced in the reaction of 10 and deoxyguanosine and decomposes to 1 and guanine upon mild acid treatment, suggesting possible neighboring group participation in its facile hydrolytic cleavage. All of the major products from the reaction of 10 and 12 have been characterized, including the direct alkylation product, 7-(2-(methylnitrosamino)ethyl)acycloguanosine (13), and N2-(2-(methylnitrosamino)ethyl)guanine, which was independently synthesized. Elucidation of the reactions of DNA with 10 and other electrophiles was facilitated by the development of both partial and total enzymatic hydrolysis assays utilizing 32P-5\xe2\x80\x98-labeled DNA oligotetramers containing one of each base type and HPLC with radiometric detection. The partial hydrolysis assay gives information as to the type of base being modified, and the total hydrolysis assay permits a determination of the number of adducts produced for a given base. The assays permit a comparison between reactions where the same type of base adduct could be expected. Comparisons of the reactions of ethylene oxide and 10 using this methodology showed that 10 does not hydroxyethylate guanine in DNA. "
"A series of substituted triarylmethylium cations, including malachite green, tris(4-methoxyphenyl)methylium, and bis(4-methoxyphenyl)phenylmethylium cations, has been prepared adsorbed on tridirectional large pore zeolites Y and \xce\xb2 in their H+ or La3+ form, as well as within the novel mesoporous aluminosilicate MCM-41, by ship-in-a-bottle synthesis from the corresponding benzaldehyde and N,N-dimethylaniline or anisole. The resulting composites exhibit diffuse reflectance and IR spectra characteristic of these trityl dyes. The cation content was determined by thermogravimetry\xe2\x88\x92differential scanning calorimetry. Preparation of these triarylmethylium cations exclusively on the external surface of ZSM-5, a medium pore zeolite whose internal voids are too small to accommodate these cations, is also possible. Therefore, the methodology based in the diffusion of smaller precursors does not guarantee itself the intrazeolite location of the synthesized guests. In this work, we have experimentally determined that the dyes are blocked in the interior of the faujasite pores. Thus, direct evidence showing the location of the organic material inside the zeolite supercages was obtained using X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These dyes incorporated within microporous solids can act as heterogeneous photosensitizers to promote the sensitized dimerization of 1,3-cyclohexadiene. "
"We have characterized and quantified several pathways which transform aliphatic sulfur radical cations into sulfoxides in aqueous solution. Sulfur radical cations were produced photochemically via one-electron photooxidation through triplet 4-carboxybenzophenone. Sulfur radical cations and superoxide yield sulfoxide, confirmed by oxygen product isotope effects and an inhibitory role of superoxide dismutase. On the basis of competition experiments with superoxide dismutase the rate constant for the reaction between dimethylsulfide radical cations and superoxide was derived as (2.3 \xc2\xb1 1.2) \xc3\x97 1011 M-1 s-1. A demetalated variant of superoxide dismutase did not inhibit superoxide mediated sulfoxide formation, confirming the importance of an active site of the enzyme for inhibition. The stoichiometry of 2 equiv of sulfoxide per reaction of superoxide with a sulfur radical cation suggests a pathway like the singlet oxygen mediated sulfoxide formation, i.e., via a persulfoxide intermediate formed via (i) direct coupling of superoxide with the sulfur radical cation or (ii) electron transfer followed by addition of the product singlet oxygen to a nonoxidized sulfide. In aqueous solution the persulfoxide may add water to yield a hydroperoxy sulfurane prior to its reaction with a second nonoxidized sulfide. At pH values larger than 9, hydroxide ion starts to compete with superoxide for sulfur radical cations and reacts with the persulfoxide or hydroperoxy sulfurane intermediates, initiating less effective pathways of sulfoxide formation. One pathway involves the formation of hydroxysulfuranyl radicals and their reaction with oxygen, supported by product and solvent isotope effects. Besides superoxide and hydroxide-mediated sulfoxide formation there is an additional route involving methylthiomethylperoxyl radicals. Based on oxygen product isotope effects, the latter appear to transfer oxygen onto the sulfide rather than reacting via electron transfer. "
"An intramolecular model was synthesized for the oxidative acyl transfer between thiamin diphosphate on the E1 and lipoic acid on the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex. The model incorporates a 2-\xce\xb1-methoxybenzylthiazolium salt as a precursor of the enamine/2-\xce\xb1-carbanion, and lipoic acid. Upon addition of the base, the enamine/2-\xce\xb1-carbanion is generated (detected at 380 nm) and is oxidized by the lipoic acid. The oxidation is very significantly enhanced by the addition of PhHgCl. It is likely that the Hg(II) shifts the equilibrium toward the reductive acylation. This appears to be the first successful model for the reductive acylation for which all intermolecular models (including control experiments in this laboratory) have failed to date. The reaction requires both a high local concentration of reactants and the trapping of the reduced thiolate by an electrophile. It is also evident from the data that oxidation of the enamine/2-\xce\xb1-carbanion intermediate on the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes requires very significant assistance by the protein (at least 105-fold rate acceleration as compared to the model here presented), unlike its oxidation by flavin (a model for the enzyme pyruvate oxidase) that requires no significant assistance once the coenzymes are bound to the enzyme (Chiu, C. C.; Pan, K.; Jordan, F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 7027\xe2\x88\x927028). "
"Quatercyclopropane 31 was oxidized, homologated, reduced, and monocyclopropanated to provide the pentacyclopropane alcohol 35. Subsequent deoxygenation of alcohol 35 was effected using N-(phenylthio)succinimide (24) and tributylphosphine followed by Raney nickel desulfurization and deprotection to produce the alcohol 3. This was oxidized, homologated, and hydrolyzed to provide the fatty acid 2. BOP-Cl-mediated coupling of acid 2 and the nucleoside amine 40 gave amide 1, which was spectroscopically identical with an authentic sample of FR-900848 (1). "
"This paper presents a critical analysis of two transition state models for the bis-cinchona alkaloid catalyzed enantioselective dihydroxylation of olefins using a broad range of experimental data. In one model (Sharpless) the transition state resembles a metallaoxetane structure formed by [2 + 2] cycloaddition of OsO and CC, and in the other the transition state is a five-membered structure in which one axial and one equatorial oxygen of cinchona bound OsO4 are becoming attached to the olefinic carbons by a [3 + 2] cycloaddition process from an Os\xe2\x88\x92olefin \xcf\x80-complex (CCN model, Figure 1). Data on the enantioselectivity of the asymmetric dihydroxylation of a wide variety of olefinic substrates and on the selectivity of a range of catalyst structures agree well with expectations based on the CCN model, but not the Sharpless model.

"Discodermolide is a marine natural product reported to inhibit the proliferation of T cells and exhibit immunosuppresive activity. Total syntheses of the natural antipode of discodermolide and several variants are reported. These studies provide reagents to investigate discodermolide\'s recently discovered ability to bind and stabilize microtubules in cells. Retrosynthetically, the polypropionate is divided into three fragments of approximately equal complexity. This modular strategy provides convergency in the synthesis and facilitates the preparation of discodermolide-based reagents. "
"Kulolide, a cyclic depsipeptide, was isolated from a cephalaspidean mollusk, Philinopsis speciosa Pease, 1860.

"A cytotoxic glycoside macrolide, callipeltoside A, has been isolated from the marine lithistid sponge Callipelta sp., collected off New Caledonia. Structural assigment was accomplished through extensive 2D NMR spectroscopy. The complete relative stereochemistry is proposed from the analysis of ROESY and NOE difference experiments. Callipeltoside A (1) represents the first member of a new class of marine-derived macrolides, containing unusual structural features including a 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-2-O,3-C-dimethyl-\xce\xb1-talopyranosyl-3,4-urethane unit.

"Upon reaction with methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (1b) at \xe2\x88\x9240 \xc2\xb0C, vitamin D2 (2a) or its 3\xce\xb2-acetyl derivative (2b) give in high yield (78\xe2\x88\x9280%) the corresponding tetraepoxide (3a,b) as a single diastereoisomer having the 5,6(\xce\xb2);7,8(\xce\xb2);10,19(\xce\xb1);22,23(pseudo-\xce\xb1) configuration. Transformation of tetraepoxide 3a into its 3\xce\xb2-(p-bromobenzoyl) derivative 3c allowed X-ray diffraction analysis; this permitted us to ascertain that the stereomeric tetraepoxide product has the R configuration at all of the seven newly generated stereocenters, i.e. 5R,6R;7R,8R;10R(19);22R,23R. The oxidation of 3\xce\xb2-acetyl vitamin D2 (2b) with the less powerful dimethyldioxirane (1a) led to the corresponding 5,6(\xce\xb2);7,8(\xce\xb2);10,19(\xce\xb1)-triepoxide 4 as the major product (62%), accompanied by tetraepoxide 3b (26%). Parallel to vitamin D3 triepoxide, remarkable site selectivity was monitored in oxyfunctionalization of 3\xce\xb2-acetyl vitamin D2 tetraepoxide (3b) at the side-chain tertiary C-25. Reaction of tetraepoxide 3b with the powerful dioxirane 1b at 0 \xc2\xb0C left the epoxide groups and remaining C-H functionalities intact, affording the 25-hydroxy derivative 5 in good isolated yield (61%).

"Twenty-one boronic acids were studied for their ability to transport saccharides in and out of liposomes. The rates of liposome efflux were determined using an enzymatic assay, whereas the influx studies used a radiotracer method. All boronic acids examined, except those that were highly hydrophilic, facilitated monosaccharide transport. The order of transport selectivity was sorbitol > fructose > glucose. The disaccharides maltose and sucrose were not transported to any significant degree. Facilitated transport was demonstrated with a variety of liposome types, including multilamellar and unilamellar vesicles with anionic or cationic polar lipid additives. Transport mechanism studies included the accumulation of structure\xe2\x88\x92activity data, as well as systematic investigations of various environmental changes such as pH, added salt, membrane potential, and temperature. Overall, the evidence is strongly in favor of a membrane carrier mechanism. The boronic acid combines reversibly with a diol group on the monosaccharide to produce a tetrahedral, anionic boronate, which is the major complexed structure in bulk, aqueous solution. At the bilayer surface, the tetrahedral boronate is in equilibrium with its neutral, trigonal form, which is the actual transported species. At low carrier concentrations, a first-order dependence on carrier was observed indicating that the transported species was a 1:1 sugar\xe2\x88\x92boronate. At higher carrier concentrations the kinetic order approached 2, suggesting the increased participation of a 1:2 sugar\xe2\x88\x92bisboronate transport pathway. The effect of boronic acids on liposomal bilayer fluidity was probed by fluorescence spectroscopy using appropriate reporter molecules. Adding cholesterol to the liposome membranes reduced translational fluidity by \xe2\x80\x9cpacking and ordering\xe2\x80\x9d the bilayer. Addition of lipophilic arylboronic acids (either free or complexed with monosaccharides) induced a similar but smaller effect. "
"Using dynamic NMR spectroscopy, the kinetic isotope effects of the degenerate single hydron transfer in the conjugate 15N-labeled porphyrin anion Por-H- dissolved in organic solvents have been measured as a function of temperature. Por-H- was generated by dissolving the labeled parent compound porphyrin together with the phosphazene base 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexakis(dimethylamino)-3-[(1,1,2,2-tetramethylpropyl)imino]-3-[[tris(dimethylamino)phosphoranyliden]amino]-1\xce\xbb5,3\xce\xbb5,5\xce\xbb5,1,4-triphosphazadiene (tHept-P4) in organic solvents. In addition, by reaction of porphyrin with the base 1,1,1,5,5,5-tetrakis[tris(dimethylamino)phosphoranylidene]amino]phosphonium fluoride (P5+F-) Por-H- could be embedded into the solid state and its tautomerism followed by 15N CPMAS NMR. Surprisingly, within the margin of error, the degeneracy of the tautomerism was not lifted in the solid state and the rate constants of the proton transfer were identical in the liquid and the solid. The kinetic isotope effects at 240 K (extrapolated) are given by kH/kD = 34 and kH/kT \xe2\x89\x88 152. The size and the temperature dependence of the isotope effects indicates a proton tunneling mechanism as in the parent porphyrin where this process is nondegenerate. However, the proton tunneling contribution is much larger in the anion as there the process is degenerate. These findings are reproduced in terms of a modified Bell tunnel model for both systems. "
"The first use of polyether dendrons as macromolecular initiators for the controlled free radical polymerization of vinyl monomers has been demonstrated. Dendrons containing either a single benzylic TEMPO or halide functionality at their focal point have been used for the nitroxide mediated and atom transfer radical polymerizations, respectively. In both cases, hybrid dendritic-linear block copolymers with well-controlled molecular weights and low polydispersities can be obtained. The structure of the hybrid block copolymers is supported by SEC and spectral data. All the copolymers exhibit a single Tg, indicating that both blocks are miscible. Hybrid block copolymers difficult or impossible to prepare by previous techniques have been synthesized to demonstrate the versatility of this approach. "
"New synthetic procedures have been developed for Me5C5M(acac), M = Co or Ni. The crystal structures of these 17- or 18-electron monomers show that the compounds are isomorphous and in space group P1\xcc\x84, with the planes defined by the Me5C5 ring and the M(acac) fragment perpendicular to within 5\xc2\xb0. The Me5C5 ring in both molecules has an ene\xe2\x88\x92allyl distortion which is rationalized by the low molecular symmetry (Cs), which removes the degeneracy in the e+ and e- ring orbitals. The electronic structure of the cobalt compound is 2A, as deduced from magnetic susceptibility and EPR spectroscopy. The electronic structure of the nickel compound depends upon the temperature. In the solid state, the compound is diamagnetic below 150 K, but it becomes paramagnetic with increasing temperature. The 1H NMR chemical shifts of the compound in solution are nonlinear in temperature, and a plot of \xce\xb4 vs T-1 yields an equilibrium constant of 0.47 at 303 K for the low spin \xe2\x86\x94 high spin equilibrium. The 20-electron phosphine complexes of nickel can be isolated; Me5C5Ni(acac)(PMe3) is a simple paramagnet with two unpaired spins, but the PEt3 complex exists in equilibrium with its base-free compound in solution. The cobalt compound does not give an isolable phosphine complex. A simple symmetry orbital model is proposed that accounts for the electronic and molecular structures of these organometallic compounds. "
"Oxygen intercalation into a pyrochlore at room temperature is reported. A simple chemical route was employed. Previously only perovskite or a few closely related phase have demonstrated an ability to act as hosts for such intercalation. The specific system studied was the interstitial solid solution Ce2Zr2O7+x (0 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 0.36). Neutron diffraction reveals that interstitial oxygen enters the tetrahedral 8b sites (space group Fd3\xcc\x84m), which are empty in stoichiometric pyrochlore, but displacement of existing oxygen from the tetrahedral 8a sites also occurs. The lattice contracts on intercalation due to oxidation of Ce3+. The changes in structure and the diffusion pathways for oxygen are discussed. "
"The reaction of PhCH(OCH3)2 with Cp(CO)3WH and HOTf gives [Cp(CO)3W(PhCH2OCH3)]+OTf-. The structure of this benzyl methyl ether complex was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction and was shown to have the ether bonded to tungsten through the oxygen. This compound was isolated as a kinetic product of the reaction; it decomposes in solution by releasing free PhCH2OCH3 and forming Cp(CO)3WOTf. An analog with the BAr\xe2\x80\x984- counterion [Ar\xe2\x80\x98 = 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] is more stable. The reaction of the vinyl acetal CH2CHCH(OEt)2 with Cp(CO)3WH and HOTf produces [Cp(CO)3W(\xce\xb72-EtOCHCHCH3)]+OTf-, in which the ether is bonded to tungsten through the CC bond of the vinyl ether. The crystal structure of this compound shows that the WC(OEt) distance (2.69(3) \xc3\x85) is significantly longer than the WC(CH3) distance (2.37(3) \xc3\x85). There are weak CH\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O hydrogen bonds between both vinyl CH\'s and oxygens of triflate counterions. Evidence is presented that some of these weak hydrogen bonds are maintained in CD2Cl2 solution but not in CD3CN. "
"The thermolysis of the Co\xe2\x88\x92C bond in adocobinamide (AdoCbi+BF4-) in anaerobic ethylene glycol has been studied as a function of a series of para-substituted pyridine axial bases using the TEMPO radical-trapping method. In contrast to the slower rates of Co\xe2\x88\x92C cleavage previously found for benzylcobinamide, neopentylcobinamide, and the (\xce\xb1-phenylethyl)cobaloxime coenzyme B12 models, for AdoCbi+ the rate of total Co\xe2\x88\x92C cleavage becomes faster as the para-substituted pyridines become more electron-donating. Specifically, the 110 \xc2\xb0C kobsd for AdoCbi+BF4- total Co\xe2\x88\x92C cleavage increased 23-fold on going from 1 M pyridine (py) to 1 M p-(dimethylamino)pyridine (Me2N-py). However, HPLC product studies reveal that the percentage of abiological Co\xe2\x88\x92C heterolysis increases (to a limiting value); that is, Co\xe2\x88\x92C heterolysis is a major reason for the observed rate increase seen for Me2N-py. Deconvolution of the kobsd rate constant into its heterolysis and homolysis components yields values of the 110 \xc2\xb0C kheterolysis and khomolysis for AdoCbi+\xc2\xb7base for Me2N-py and pyridine. These data in turn reveal that the AdoCbi+BF4- base-on homolysis rate constant does not increase within experimental error as one goes from py to the more basic Me2N-py (kon,h = 8(3) \xc3\x97 10-4 and 7(1) \xc3\x97 10-4 s-1, respectively), but that the base-on heterolysis rate constant changes by 17-fold (kon,het = 0.4(0.1) \xc3\x97 10-4 and 7(1) \xc3\x97 10-4 s-1 for py and Me2N-py, respectively). The plausible biological significance of these results is then discussed, notably the heretofore unsubstantiated idea, first suggested by Mealli, Sabat, and Marzilli, that one major evolutionary pressure for selecting and appending the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole axial base in coenzyme B12 is because this base limits Co\xe2\x88\x92C bond heterolysis, thereby promoting the biologically relevant Co\xe2\x88\x92C cleavage reaction, Co\xe2\x88\x92C homolysis.

"Structural information obtained from the analysis of nickel K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopic data of [NiFe]hydrogenases from Desulfovibrio gigas, Thiocapsa roseopersicina, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (ATCC 27774), Escherichia coli (hydrogenase-1), Chromatium vinosum, and Alcaligenes eutrophus H16 (NAD+-reducing, soluble hydrogenase), poised in different redox states, is reported. The data allow the active-site structures of enzymes from several species to be compared, and allow the effects of redox poise on the structure of the nickel sites to be examined. In addition, the structure of the nickel site obtained from recent crystallographic studies of the D. gigas enzyme (Volbeda, A.; Charon, M.-H.; Piras, C.; Hatchikian, E. C.; Frey, M.; Fontecilla-Camps, J. C. Nature 1995, 373, 580\xe2\x88\x92587) is compared with the structural features obtained from the analysis of XAS data from the same enzyme. The nickel sites of all but the oxidized (as isolated) sample of A. eutrophus hydrogenase are quite similar. The nickel K-edge energies shift 0.9\xe2\x88\x921.5 eV to lower energy upon reduction from oxidized (forms A and B) to fully reduced forms. This value is comparable with no more than a one-electron metal-centered oxidation state change. With the exception of T. roseopersicina hydrogenase, most of the edge energy shift (\xe2\x88\xbc0.8 eV) occurs upon reduction of the oxidized enzymes to the EPR-silent intermediate redox level (SI). Analysis of the XANES features assigned to 1s \xe2\x86\x92 3d electronic transitions indicates that the shift in energy that occurs for reduction of the enzymes to the SI level may be attributed at least in part to an increase in the coordination number from five to six. The smallest edge energy shift is observed for the T. roseopersicina enzyme, where the XANES data indicate that the nickel center is always six-coordinate. With the exception of the oxidized sample of A. eutrophus hydrogenase, the EXAFS data are dominated by scattering from S-donor ligands at \xe2\x88\xbc2.2 \xc3\x85. The enzyme obtained from T. roseopersicina also shows evidence for the presence of O,N-donor ligands. The data from A. eutrophus hydrogenase are unique in that they indicate that a significant structural change occurs upon reduction of the enzyme. EXAFS data obtained from the oxidized (as isolated) A. eutrophus enzyme indicate that the EXAFS is dominated by scattering from 3\xe2\x88\x924 N,O-donor atoms at 2.06(2) \xc3\x85, with contributions from 2\xe2\x88\x923 S-donor ligands at 2.35(2) \xc3\x85. This changes upon reduction to a more typical nickel site composed of \xe2\x88\xbc4 S-donor ligands at a Ni\xe2\x88\x92S distance of 2.19(2) \xc3\x85. Evidence for the presence of atoms in the 2.4\xe2\x88\x922.9 \xc3\x85 distance range is found in most samples, particularly the reduced enzymes (SI, form C, and R). The analysis of these data is complicated by the fact that it is difficult to distinguish between S and Fe scattering atoms at this distance, and by the potential presence of both S and another metal atom at similar distances. The results of EXAFS analysis are shown to be in general agreement with the published crystal structure of the D. gigas enzyme. "
"A set of porphyrin building blocks has been developed for the construction of light-harvesting model compounds and related molecular photonic devices. The porphyrins are facially encumbered to enhance solubility in organic solvents, are employed in a defined metalation state (free base (Fb) or zinc chelate), and bear peripheral functional groups such as iodo or ethyne for joining the porphyrins via covalent bonds. The coupling of an iodophenylporphyrin and an ethynylphenylporphyrin via mild Pd-mediated reactions (2\xe2\x88\x924 mM of each porphyrin in toluene/triethylamine (5:1) with Pd2(dba)3 and AsPh3 at 35 \xc2\xb0C for 2 h) yields the corresponding diphenylethyne-linked multiporphyrin array in 70\xe2\x88\x9280% yield. The arrays are easily purified by a sequence of flash silica chromatography, preparative size exclusion chromatography, and gravity elution silica chromatography. The diphenylethyne linkers give a center-to-center separation of the porphyrins of \xe2\x88\xbc20 \xc3\x85. Model light-harvesting compounds are easily prepared using Zn and Fb porphyrin building blocks. In order to investigate the role of the linker in through-bond electronic communication, and the effect of through-bond electronic communication on the rates and yields of photoinduced energy transfer in the arrays, four ZnFb dimers have been prepared that have a systematic increase in steric hindrance in the diphenylethyne unit. The presence of steric hindrance inhibits rotation of the phenyl group toward coplanarity with the porphyrin, thereby modulating the electronic communication. A linear ZnFbZn trimer and a right-angle ZnFbZn trimer have been prepared to probe the effects of geometry on electronic communication pathways. A linear ZnZnFb trimer has been synthesized to investigate the photodynamics of energy migration among isoenergetic zinc porphyrins. These multiporphyrin arrays have sufficient solubility (\xe2\x88\xbc5 mM) for routine handling in organic solvents such as toluene, CH2Cl2, or CHCl3, and can be examined spectroscopically (1\xe2\x88\x9210 \xce\xbcM) in diverse solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide, and castor oil. This building block approach should make diverse multiporphyrin arrays readily available. "
"Soluble ethyne-linked tetraarylporphyrin arrays that mimic natural light-harvesting complexes by absorbing light and directing excited-state energy have been investigated by static and time-resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. Of particular interest is the role of the diarylethyne linkers in mediating energy transfer. The major conclusions from this study, which is limited to the examination of arrays containing Zn and free-base (Fb) porphyrins, include the following:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) Singlet excited-state energy transfer from the Zn porphyrin to the Fb porphyrin is extremely efficient (95\xe2\x88\x9299%). Competitive electron-transfer reactions are not observed. (2) The rate of energy transfer is slowed up to 4-fold by the addition of groups to the linker that limit the ability of the linker and porphyrin to adopt geometries tending toward coplanarity. Thus, the mechanism of energy transfer predominantly involves through-bond communication via the linker. Consistent with this notion, the measured lifetimes of the Zn porphyrin in the dimers at room temperature yield energy-transfer rates ((88 ps)-1 < ktrans < (24 ps)-1) that are significantly faster than those predicted by the F\xc3\xb6rster (through-space) mechanism ((720 ps)-1). Nevertheless, the electronic communication is weak and the individual porphyrins appear to retain their intrinsic radiative and non-radiative rates upon incorporation into the arrays. (3) Transient absorption data indicate that the energy-transfer rate between two isoenergetic Zn porphyrins in a linear trimeric array terminated by a Fb porphyrin is (52 \xc2\xb1 19 ps)-1 in toluene at room temperature, while the time-resolved fluorescence data suggest that it may be significantly faster. Accordingly, incorporation of multiple isoenergetic pigments in extended linear or two-dimensional arrays will permit efficient overall energy transfer. (4) Medium effects, including variations in solvent polarity, temperature, viscosity, and axial solvent ligation, only very weakly alter (\xe2\x89\xa42.5-fold) the energy-transfer rates. However, the Fb porphyrin fluorescence in the Zn\xe2\x88\x92Fb dimers is quenched in the polar solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (but not in toluene, castor oil, or acetone), which is attributed to charge-transfer with the neighboring Zn porphyrin following energy transfer. Collectively, the studies demonstrate that extended multiporphyrin arrays can be designed in a rational manner with predictable photophysical features and efficient light-harvesting properties through use of the diarylethyne-linked porphyrin motif. "
"A comprehensive electrochemical (cyclic and square-wave voltammetry, coulometry) and static spectroscopic (absorption, resonance Raman (RR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)) study is reported for a series of dimeric and trimeric porphyrin-based arrays. All the arrays consist of tetraarylporphyrins linked via ethyne groups at the p-positions of the aryl rings. The complexes investigated include zinc-free base and bis-zinc dimers which contain varying degrees of torsional constraint between the porphyrin rings and the aryl group of the linker, and linear and right-angle trimers in which two zinc porphyrins are bridged by either a zinc or free base porphyrin. The spectroscopic studies were performed on singly and multiply oxidized complexes as well as the neutral species. The electrochemical and spectral properties of the arrays indicate that the electronic communication between the macrocycles is relatively weak in the ground and excited electronic states. This communication is through-bond, rather than through-space, and is mediated by the diarylethyne linker. In the case of the torsionally unconstrained dimers, unusually large RR intensity enhancements are observed for aryl-ring and ethyne-bridge stretching modes. The RR intensity enhancements are attributed to an excited-state conformational change that enhances the conjugation between the \xcf\x80-electron systems of the porphyrin ring and bridging diarylethyne group. The intensity of the aryl and ethyne-bridge vibrations monotonically decreases as the degree of torsional constraint increases. This trend parallels the decrease in energy-transfer rates observed for these arrays (unhindered, \xe2\x88\xbc(24 ps)-1; monohindered, \xe2\x88\xbc(46 ps)-1; bis-hindered \xe2\x88\xbc(88 ps)-1) and indicates that the excited-state electronic communication can be tuned via structural modification of the diarylethyne linker. In contrast, the optical and RR signatures of the linear and right-angle trimeric arrays are essentially identical indicating that the geometrical arrangement of the porphyrins does not significantly influence the excited-state communication. The half-wave potentials for oxidation of the zinc porphyrins in the dimers and trimers are essentially identical. The EPR spectra of the oxidized arrays exhibit complex temperature-dependent signatures that reflect hole/electron hopping and/or spin exchange interactions in the ground electronic state. Hole/electron hopping in all the monocations is rapid (107 s-1 or faster) on the EPR time scale in liquid solution and slow in frozen solution. Neither the degree of torsional constraint (dimers) nor the geometrical arrangement of the constituent porphyrins (trimers) has any affect on the EPR signatures of the monocations indicating that this structural element does not affect ground-state electronic communication as reflected in hole/electron hopping rates. Exchange interactions in the multiply oxidized arrays are significant (probably 1000 MHz or greater) in both liquid and frozen solutions and, in certain cases, are enhanced upon solvent freezing. Unlike the hole/electron hopping, the exchange interactions in the dimers are influenced by the degree of torsional constraint. In contrast, the geometrical arrangement of the constituent porphyrins in the trimers has no measurable effect on this property. Collectively, the static spectroscopic and electrochemical studies provide new insights into the electronic communication pathways in the diarylethyne-linked multiporphyrinic arrays. "
"The formation of the helical morphology in monolayers and bilayers of chiral amphiphilic assemblies is believed to be driven at least partly by the interactions at the chiral centers of the amphiphiles. However, a detailed microscopic understanding of these interactions and their relation with the helix formation is still not clear. In this article a study of the molecular origin of the chirality-driven helix formation is presented by calculating, for the first time, the effective pair potential between a pair of chiral molecules. This effective potential depends on the relative sizes of the groups attached to the two chiral centers, on the orientation of the amphiphile molecules, and also on the distance between them. We find that for the mirror-image isomers (in the racemic modification) the minimum energy conformation is a nearly parallel alignment of the molecules. On the other hand, the same for a pair of molecules of one kind of enantiomer favors a tilt angle between them, thus leading to the formation of a helical morphology of the aggregate. The tilt angle is determined by the size of the groups attached to the chiral centers of the pair of molecules considered and in many cases predicted it to be close to 45\xc2\xb0. The present study, therefore, provides a molecular origin of the intrinsic bending force, suggested by Helfrich (J. Chem. Phys. 1986, 85, 1085\xe2\x88\x921087), to be responsible for the formation of helical structure. This effective potential may explain many of the existing experimental results, such as the size and the concentration dependence of the formation of helical morphology. It is further found that the elastic forces can significantly modify the pitch predicted by the chiral interactions alone and that the modified real pitch is close to the experimentally observed value. The present study is expected to provide a starting point for future microscopic studies. "
"We have investigated the relative orientational preference of two benzene and two toluene molecules in a vacuum and in water, by means of free energy calculations. The gas-phase simulations reveal that, whereas the T-shaped benzene dimer is 0.78 kcal/mol lower in free energy than its stacked homologue, the sandwich arrangement of the toluene dimer is preferred over the T-shaped structure by 0.18 kcal/mol. MP2/TZP ab initio binding energies, evaluated for both dimers, were found to be consistent with the molecular mechanical estimates, hence suggesting that the van der Waals and the electrostatic contributions to the macromolecular force field employed herein are well balanced. We further note that our results agree quite nicely with the experimental binding energies of Neusser and Krause, obtained from breakdown measurements. The tendency witnessed in the gas phase is magnified in an aqueous solution, with differences in free energy between the T-shaped and the sandwich arrangements of the benzene and the toluene dimers equal to \xe2\x88\x921.47 and 1.12 kcal/mol, respectively. The calculated association constants and osmotic second virial coefficients also correlate reasonably well with the experimental data of Tucker and Christian. The conflict between the orientational preferences of the benzene and the toluene dimers is suggestive that trends in \xe2\x80\x9c\xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80\xe2\x80\x9d interactions in proteins should be rationalized by other factors than simple electrostatic/dispersion considerations. The analysis of Phe\xe2\x88\x92Phe pairs in protein crystallographic structures sheds light on the influence of both sterical hindrances and ancillary interactions between the aromatic moities and neighboring functional groups on the orientational preference of the phenyl rings.

"The parametrization and testing of the OPLS all-atom force field for organic molecules and peptides are described. Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids. "
"To examine the effect of solvent environment on protein salt-bridges, we performed high-level ab initio molecular orbital calculations in the gas phase and in three different solvents on a salt-bridge as modeled by formate and guanidinium ions. The energy difference between the neutral hydrogen-bonded complex and the zwitterionic form and the interconversion barrier between them are investigated in detail at RHF/6-31G*, RHF/6-311+G**, MP2/6-31G*, and MP2/6-311+G** levels. In the gas phase, the neutral conventional hydrogen-bonded complex is predicted to be favored at all four levels of theory and there is a small barrier for the interconversion. In a nonpolar, hydrophobic solvent like CCl4, the energy difference between these two forms is small and the barrier that separates them is also low, but the neutral hydrogen-bonded complex still seems to be slightly favored. However, in polar solvents like DMSO and water, the zwitterionic form becomes much more favored. In polar solvents, the barrier for conversion of the neutral hydrogen-bonded form to the zwitterionic form is small at the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock level, but it disappears at the correlated level (MP2). The implication of these findings toward stabilizing an enzyme in nonaqueous solvents is briefly discussed. "
"Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry was used to study ion/molecule reactions of six cationic methyl metallocenes:\xe2\x80\x89 [Cp2ZrCH3]+ (1; Cp = \xce\xb75-cyclopentadienyl), [(Ind)(Cp)ZrCH3]+ (2; Ind = \xce\xb75-indenyl), [Ind2ZrCH3]+ (3), [ansa-(CH3)2Si(\xce\xb75-C5H4)2ZrCH3]+ (4), [(Flu)2ZrCH3]+ (5; Flu = \xce\xb75-fluorenyl), and [ansa-(CH3)2Si(\xce\xb75-C5Me4)(N-t-C4H9)ZrCH3]+ (6). Rate constants and product distributions for reactions with dihydrogen and various deuterium-labeled and unlabeled alkenes were determined. The electrophilicity of [L2Zr\xe2\x88\x92CH3]+ ions in the gas phase is strongly dependent on the nature of the ancillary ligands L, with electrophilicity decreasing in the order Cp2 > Cp,Ind> Ind2 > Flu2 for reactions with dihydrogen and 1-alkenes. Silyl-bridging of Cp ligands as in 4 appears to increase the electrophilicity somewhat, and the 10-electron ion 6 also has higher electrophilicity than 1. In each reaction used to assess electrophilicity, the probable rate determining transition state involves a 4-center/4-electron species in either C\xe2\x88\x92H or H\xe2\x88\x92H activation. In the reaction of ethylene with [L2Zr\xe2\x88\x92CH3]+, labeling studies show partial-to-complete scrambling of H/D labels before elimination of dihydrogen. Scrambling increases with decreasing electrophilicity of the ion. A model for the intramolecular isotope effect leads to kH/kD = 2.2 for the allylic C\xe2\x88\x92H(D) activation step in reaction of 3 with ethylene. Isotopic labeling has shown that the C\xe2\x88\x92H activation of isobutene by [L2Zr\xe2\x88\x92CH3]+ proceeds via allylic activation only. Dimerization and hydrolysis of [L2Zr\xe2\x88\x92CH3]+ is facile in the gas phase, and the products are analogous to known side reactions in solution chemistry. The polymerization activity of electrophilic zirconium polymerization catalysts does not necessarily correlate with the intrinsic electrophilicity of [L2Zr\xe2\x88\x92CH3]+ species as L is varied. The ion pairing tendency of [L2Zr\xe2\x88\x92CH3]+ in solution is a key contributor to the overall propagation rate, and the stability (Kip) of the ion pair for a given counterion is expected to decrease as L becomes more electron donating and larger. If the ion pair preequilibrium trends dominate the kinetics, then more active catalysts can be obtained by introducing larger ancillary ligands with electron-donating substituents despite the reduced electrophilicity of the metallocenium ion.

"High-level ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the G2(+) level of theory have been carried out on the identity front-side nucleophilic substitution reactions with retention of configuration, X- + CH3X, for X = F, Cl, Br, and I. Overall gas-phase barrier heights do not show a strong variation with halogen atom and are calculated to be 184.5 (X = F), 193.8 (X = Cl), 178.9 (X = Br), and 171.4 kJ mol-1 (X = I), substantially higher than the corresponding barriers for back-side attack (\xe2\x88\x928.0 for X = F, 11.5 for X = Cl, 5.8 for X = Br, and 6.5 kJ mol-1 for X = I). The difference between the overall barrier for back-side attack and front-side attack is smallest for X = I (164.9 kJ mol-1). Central barrier heights for front-side attack decrease in the following order:\xe2\x80\x89 241.0 (X = F), 237.8 (X = Cl), 220.0 (X = Br), and 207.4 kJ mol-1 (X = I). The minimum energy pathways for both back-side and front-side SN2 reactions are found to involve the same ion\xe2\x88\x92molecule complex (X-\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7H3CX), with the front-side pathway becoming feasible at higher energies. Indeed, our results suggest that the chloride exchange in CH3Cl, which has been found in gas-phase experiments at high energies, may be the first example of a front-side SN2 reaction with retention of configuration at saturated carbon. Analysis of our computational data in terms of frontier orbital theory suggests that elongation of the bond between the central atom and X could be a significant factor in decreasing the unfavorable nature of the front-side SN2 reaction with retention of configuration in going from X = F to X = I. Ion\xe2\x88\x92molecule complexes CH3\xe2\x88\x92X\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7X-, which may be pre-reaction complexes in direct collinear halophilic attack, were found for X = Br and I but not for X = F and Cl. The calculated complexation energies (\xce\x94Hcomp) for halophilic complexes are considerably smaller (7.3 and 19.4 kJ mol-1 for X = Br and I, respectively) than those for the corresponding pre-reaction complexes for SN2 attack at carbon (41.1 and 36.0 kJ mol-1 for X = Br and I, respectively). Nucleophilic substitution reactions at the halogen atom in CH3X (X = F\xe2\x88\x92I) (halophilic reactions) are highly endothermic and appear to represent an unlikely mechanistic pathway for identity halide exchange.

"Three molecular dynamics simulations of the free, phosphate ion-bound and phosphopeptide-bound C-terminal SH2 domain of phospholipase C\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb31 (PLCC\xc2\xb7pY) have been performed to aid in the interpretation of chemical shift data and the elucidation of interatomic interactions at the phosphotyrosine (pTyr) binding region. The simulation of the phosphopeptide complex was carried out with newly developed CHARMM force-field parameters for pTyr, optimized against experimental data and ab initio calculations. The lack of NOEs involving phosphate in the binding pocket had necessitated a chemical shift analysis of the pTyr binding region for a more detailed characterization of the hydrogen bonding interactions involving pTyr. Although most of these interactions are not present in the NMR structure used as the simulation starting point, the system converges early in the simulation to a structure more compatible with the chemical shift data. This is supported by ab initio determination of the 1H\xce\xb7 and 1H\xce\xb5 chemical shifts of the three arginines (Arg 18, 37, and 39) in the pTyr binding pocket based on the PLCC\xc2\xb7 pY MD structure, which are in accord with the experimental values. The simulation structure of the PLCC\xc2\xb7pY complex reveals a more complete picture of interatomic interactions in the pTyr binding pocket than is possible with current chemical shift and NOE approaches alone, thereby permitting the identification of the primary pTyr-recognition residues. This pattern of interactions is strikingly similar to those of crystal structures of related SH2 domains. The simulations also suggest several alternative interpretations of the chemical shift data to those suggested in the experimental investigation (Pascal, S. M., et al. Biochemistry 1995, 34, 11353). This insight is valuable as the observed chemical shifts could result from a number of possible pictures of interactions. The present study demonstrates that the combination of molecular dynamics simulations and ab initio chemical shift calculations can enhance the hydrogen-bonding, amino\xe2\x88\x92aromatic, and aliphatic\xe2\x88\x92aromatic information content of NOE- and chemical-shift-based protein structures and serve as a complementary tool for the interpretation of chemical shift data at the atomic level.

"Solid-state NMR has been used to detect an intercatechol covalent bond in sclerotized cuticle of the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta). Rotational-echo, double-resonance (REDOR) 13C and 15N NMR, in combination with 1H\xe2\x88\x9213C dipolar modulation and 15N\xe2\x88\x9215N dipolar restoration at the magic angle, were used to examine hornworm pupal exuviae labeled with \xce\xb2-[15N]alanine and either [\xce\xb2-13C]dopamine or [\xce\xb1-13C,15N]dopamine. The REDOR spectra showed the incorporation of N-\xce\xb2-alanyldopamine into insect cuticle by the formation of a variety of covalent bonds. One of these bonds links the terminal nitrogen of one N-\xce\xb2-alanyldopamine molecule to the \xce\xb2 carbon of another to form an intercatechol covalent bond. This result is interpreted in terms of a novel structure for stabilized cuticle that postulates protein\xe2\x88\x92catechol\xe2\x88\x92catechol\xe2\x88\x92protein cross-links. REDOR spectra also showed oxygen substitution at both \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 carbons of N-\xce\xb2-alanyldopamine, consistent with the possibility of intercatechol oxygen bridges in dimeric or oligomeric forms of catecholamines in the cuticle.

"The interconversion of model compounds {[(NH3)3Cu]2(\xce\xbc-\xce\xb72:\xce\xb72-O2)}2+ (1) and {[(NH3)3Cu]2(\xce\xbc-O)2}2+ (2) has been examined using multireference second-order perturbation theory with an 8-electron/8-orbital active space. At this level of theory, 1 and 2 are separated by only 0.3 kcal/mol, and the barrier to isomerization is predicted to be very low based on single-point energy calculations for intermediate structures. The flat nature of the potential energy surface along the interconversion coordinate derives from a balancing of Coulomb forces and nondynamic electron correlation. The latter effect depends critically on the significant energy change experienced by the 13au virtual orbital on passing from one isomer to the other. In addition, solvation electrostatics favor 2 over 1. "
"Formyl chloride has been generated in aqueous solution (i) by stopped-flow ozonation of vinyl chloride and (ii) by reacting dichloromethyl radicals with OH radicals using the pulse radiolysis technique. Vinyl chloride reacts in water with ozone (k = 1.7 \xc3\x97 104 dm3 mol-1 s-1, as determined by stopped-flow) yielding as final products (mol per mol of ozone) chloride ions (1.05), CO (1.01), and formate ions (0.06). Hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide (formaldehyde plus H2O2; 1.08) is also formed. HCl and formic acid are formed in less than 2 ms (the detection limit of the stopped-flow setup). At high pH the CO yield decreases (at pH 13.6 by 50%). It is concluded that the precursor of CO, HCl, and formic acid is formyl chloride. It predominantly decays into CO and HCl, and only at very high pH can hydrolysis to formic acid and HCl compete successfully. Using the pulse radiolysis technique dichloromethyl radicals are generated in Ar-saturated solutions from chloroform by reacting it with the solvated electron (originating from the radiolysis of water). The OH radicals (also from the radiolysis of water) partially react with the dichloromethyl radicals yielding dichloromethanol. Alternatively, dichloromethanol is generated in N2O-saturated solutions from dichloromethane, where some of the OH radicals are allowed to abstract an H atom from dichloromethane and another fraction to add to the dichloromethyl radicals. The observed conductivity changes are attributed to a very rapid decay (t1/2 < 20 \xce\xbcs) of dichloromethanol into formyl chloride and HCl followed by the decay of formyl chloride into CO and HCl (k = 104 s-1). From these data and the decrease of the CO yield at high pH (ozonation of vinyl chloride) it is estimated that the OH--induced hydrolysis of formyl chloride occurs with a rate constant of ca. 2.5 \xc3\x97 104 dm3 mol-1 s-1.

"The initial step in the mechanism-based inactivation of ribonucleotide reductases by 2\xe2\x80\x98-chloro-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxynucleotides is abstraction of H3\xe2\x80\x98 by a proximal free radical on the enzyme. The C3\xe2\x80\x98 radical is postulated to undergo spontaneous loss of chloride, and the resulting cationic radical loses a proton to give a 3\xe2\x80\x98-keto intermediate. Successive \xce\xb2-eliminations produce a Michael acceptor which causes inactivation. This hypothesis would predict rapid loss of mesylate or tosylate anions from C2\xe2\x80\x98, but sluggish loss of azide or thiomethoxide. In contrast, loss of azido and methylthio radicals from C2\xe2\x80\x98 should occur readily whereas homolysis to give (methyl or tolylsulfonyl)oxy and fluoro radicals should be energetically prohibitive. Protected 3\xe2\x80\x98-O-(phenoxythiocarbonyl)-2\xe2\x80\x98-substituted nucleosides were treated with tributylstannane/AIBN or triphenylsilane/dibenzoyl peroxide in refluxing toluene. The 2\xe2\x80\x98-O-(mesyl and tosyl) and 2\xe2\x80\x98-fluoro compounds underwent direct radical-mediated hydrogenolysis of the thionocarbonate group to give 3\xe2\x80\x98-deoxy-2\xe2\x80\x98-substituted products, whereas 2\xe2\x80\x98-(azido, bromo, chloro, iodo, and methylthio)-3\xe2\x80\x98-thionocarbonates gave 2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-didehydro-2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-dideoxy derivatives via loss of 2\xe2\x80\x98-substituents from an incipient C3\xe2\x80\x98 radical. These results are in harmony with loss of radicals, but not anions, from C2\xe2\x80\x98. The well-known radical-mediated hydrogenolytic cleavage of halogen and methylthio (slow) groups from C2\xe2\x80\x98 of the 3\xe2\x80\x98-hydroxy (unprotected) precursors and reduction of 2\xe2\x80\x98-azides to amines occurred with tributylstannane/AIBN. Triphenylsilane/dibenzoyl peroxide gave parallel (but slower) hydrogenolysis with the 2\xe2\x80\x98-(iodo, bromo, and methylthio) compounds, but cleavage of the 2\xe2\x80\x98-chloro group was very slow and no reduction of 2\xe2\x80\x98-azides to amines was detected. Rather, the latter system effected slow hydrogenolytic removal of the 2\xe2\x80\x98-azido group. Thus, chemoselective differentiation of certain functional groups is possible with triphenylsilane and tributylstannane. Reduction of azides to amines with tributylstannane is known, but hydrogenolytic deazidation (slow) with triphenylsilane in the absence of amine formation appears to be novel. "
"The ability to tune the metal binding affinity of small peptides through the incorporation of unnatural multidentate \xce\xb1-amino acids and the preorganization of peptide structure is illustrated. Herein, we describe the exploitation of a family of \xce\xb1-amino acids that incorporate powerful bidentate ligands (bipyridyl and phenanthrolyl groups) as integral constituents of the residues\' side chains. The residues involved are the 6-, 5-, and 4-substituted (S)-2-amino-3-(2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridyl)propanoic acids (1, 6Bpa; 2, 5Bpa; 3, 4Bpa), (S)-2-amino-3-(1,10-phenanthrol-2-yl)propanoic acid (4, Fen), and a novel neocuproine-containing \xce\xb1-amino acid, (S)-2-amino-3-(9-methyl-1,10-phenanthrol-2-yl)propanoic acid (5, Neo). Within this family of amino acids, variations in metal binding due to the nature of the ring system (2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridyl or 1,10-phenanthrolyl) and the point of attachment to the amino acid \xce\xb2-carbon are observed. Additionally, the underlying peptide architecture significantly influences binding for peptides that include multiple metal-ligating residues. These differences in affinity arise from the interplay of ligand type and structural preorganization afforded by the peptide sequence, resulting in dissociation constants ranging from 10-3 to <10-6 M for ZnII. These studies illustrate that significant control of metal cation binding affinity, preference, and stoichiometry may be achieved through the use of a wide variety of native and unnatural metal-coordinating amino acids incorporated into a polypeptide architecture.

"Huperzine A (HA), a potent reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), is an important psychotherapeutic agent for improving cognitive function in Alzheimer\'s patients through the enhancement of central cholinergic tone. This molecule takes on added value in that it has recently been shown to exhibit neuroprotective properties (glutamate toxicity blocking activity) in vitro. Based upon our cumulative SAR information and to some extent the predicted binding site of HA within Torpedo AChE, we chose to investigate the synthesis and biology of certain C-10 substituted analogues. The important finding was made that introduction of an axial methyl group into the C-10 position of huperzine A increased the potency for AChE inhibition 8-fold; the corresponding equatorial isomer was about 1.5-fold less active than huperzine A. The introduction of substituents larger than methyl resulted in a drop in activity. For example, the ethyl analogue was found to be about 100-fold less active than huperzine A, indicating that while it is still capable of binding to Torpedo AChE, some steric interaction with the \xe2\x80\x9cwalls\xe2\x80\x9d of the active site gorge must result. Through the use of molecular modeling methods involving the docking of these analogues to the reported X-ray crystal structure of Torpedo AChE, it is clearly evident that the C-10 axial methyl group points into a hydrophobic region of the enzyme, while the equatorial methyl group is directed to a less favorable hydrophilic region. Substituents larger than methyl were found to result in a conformational energy penalty. The ready explanation of this structure\xe2\x88\x92activity relationship data provides further evidence in support of our modeling studies aimed at establishing huperzine A\'s binding site in AChE. This knowledge should facilitate the identification of other structural analogues of huperzine A likely to exhibit an improved therapeutic profile. "
"U-102408 has been isolated from S. arginensis cultures and fully characterized by NMR and MS. These studies indicate that U-102408 is identical with sulfomycin, and this data confirm the structure of sulfomycin which was assigned by chemical degradation and limited NMR studies. The biosynthetic origins of all U-102408 structural features have been elucidated through isotopic labeling experiments with primarily 13C but also using 14C, deuterium or tritium. Of particular interest, the 4-hydroxy-2-amino-2-pentenoic acid moiety was determined to originate from threonine and a one carbon unit derived from the two position of glycine or the S-methyl of methionine. The biosynthetic pathway for U-102408 differs from that for nosiheptide, thiostrepton, and berninamycin in that cysteine and serine do not cross label sites in U-102408, while this has been observed for the other thiopeptides. In U-102408 cysteine and serine are each incorporated into unique sites within the molecule. This indicates that the interconversion of cysteine and serine is not an active pathway for S. arginensis. In fact for fermentations in defined medium the addition of cysteine was found to be necessary to achieve higher antibiotic titer. Unlike the other thiopeptides that have been studied, threonine was incorporated into sites labeled by serine though serine did not incorporate into sites labeled by threonine within U-102408. No cross labeling of threonine and serine has been observed in studies of nosiheptide, thiostrepton, or berninamycin. In the current study glycine is investigated as a precursor for U-102408. The interconversion of glycine to serine is a very facile pathway in S. arginensis; glycine labels all sites labeled by serine. This data suggests glycine as a possible precursor for nosiheptide, thiostrepton, and berninamycin which has not been investigated for these other thiopeptides. Incorporation of label from 3-2H-serine is facile for thiostrepton and nosiheptide and was used to probe the mechanism of formation of the pyridine ring. However, no incorporation from 3-2H-serine or 3-3H-serine was observable for U-102408. While the lack of incorporation may be due to washout of the label from the precursor, it also may be due to the interconversion of serine and glycine causing loss of the label from the serine pool.

"Striga asiatica (Scrophulariaceae) is a parasitic plant requiring a host-derived signal, xenognosin, to initiate a cascade of events necessary for the establishment of host contact. By attempting to model the distribution of the xenognosin around the host, the activity of the signal is shown to be strongly dependent on the presence of another component in the host exudate. Surprisingly this component, characterized as 4,6-dimethoxy-2-[(8\xe2\x80\x98Z,11\xe2\x80\x98Z)-8\xe2\x80\x98,11\xe2\x80\x98,14\xe2\x80\x98-pentadecatriene]resorcinol, is structurally related and shares the same biosynthetic pathway as the xenognosin. This compound is shown to function as an antioxidant and its ability to enhance the activity of the xenognosin is consistent with its ability to extend its lifetime in the exudate. This endogenous antioxidant activity is required to explain the spatial sensing in the establishment of the host\xe2\x88\x92parasite interface and its characterization provides insight into how chemical potential may be regulated within and around plant tissues.

"Allenic zinc reagents (R1R2CCC(R3)ZnL) are efficiently prepared by the reaction of propargylic substrates (R1R2C(X)C\xe2\x8b\xaeCH, X = MeSO2O, Cl, R2NCO2) with a variety of triorganozincates ((R3)3ZnM; R3 = alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, M = Li, MgCl). Treatment of the allenic zinc reagents with D2O gives the corresponding deuteroallenes with high deuterium incorporation. The allenic zinc reagents thus prepared undergo a coupling reaction with a variety of electrophiles (aldehydes, acyl chlorides, I2, NCS, and chlorosilanes) regioselectively at the \xce\xb3 position to afford the corresponding propargylic derivatives (R1R2C(El)C\xe2\x8b\xaeCR3, El = RCH(OH), RCO, I, Cl, R3Si) in high yields. Silicon containing allenic zinc reagents R1CHCC(CH2SiMe3)ZnL and R1CHCC(SiPhMe2)ZnL are readily prepared by the reaction of propargylic carbamates (R1CH(OCONPh2)C\xe2\x8b\xaeCH) with (TMSCH2)3ZnLi and by the reaction of bromoproparglic mesylates R1CH(OSO2Me)C\xe2\x8b\xaeCBr with (PhMe2Si)3ZnLi, respectively. Successive treatment of these reagents with electrophiles affords functionalized organosilicon compounds of high synthetic utility. "
"Investigation of the structure and reactivity of \xce\xb2-lithiated \xce\xb2-phenylcarboxamides is reported. NMR spectroscopic investigations of \xce\xb2-lithiated amides 15 and 24 establish that the benzylic lithium is complexed by the nitrogen of the amide. The \xce\xb2-lithiated N-methyl amide 15 forms a complex with (\xe2\x88\x92)-sparteine (4) which undergoes electrophilic substitution to provide enantioenriched products. The \xce\xb2-lithiated N-isopropyl amide 24 does not form a complex with 4, so there is no asymmetric induction. The enantioselectivity of the reaction is shown to arise by the pathway of asymmetric substitution in which asymmetry is induced in a postdeprotonation step. Asymmetric induction in this lithiation\xe2\x88\x92substitution sequence is suggested to occur via a dynamic thermodynamic resolution. "
"A thorough investigation of the transient species from the laser flash photolysis of haloarene tethered arenes has been performed. Some transient species in the laser photolysis of N-benzyl-2-halopyridinium and N-(2-halobenzyl)pyridinium bromides have been investigated as an effort to understand the photocyclized reaction mechanism as well as to know the properties of the transients themselves. Pyridinium \xcf\x83, 2,3-dihydrocyclohexadienyl \xcf\x80, and halogen anion radicals are detected in the photolysis of a N-benzyl-2-halopyridinium salt (1 or 2) in water:\xe2\x80\x89 the absorption maxima are 250, 310, and 355 (Br\xe2\x88\x92Cl\xe2\x80\xa2-) nm, respectively. The lifetimes of 2-pyridinium \xcf\x83 radical, 2,3-dihydrocyclohexadienyl \xcf\x80, and bromine chloride (in the case of 1) anion radicals are 0.72 ms, 1.2 ms, and 9.3 \xce\xbcs, respectively. Phenyl \xcf\x83, 2,3-dihydropyridinium \xcf\x80, and halogen anion radicals are also detected in the laser photolysis of an aqueous solution of a N-(2-halobenzyl)pyridinium salt (3 or 4):\xe2\x80\x89 the absorption maxima are 250, 310, and 360 nm (Br2\xe2\x80\xa2-, in the case of 4), respectively. The lifetimes of the transient intermediates are 1.4 ms, 1.2 ms, and 10 \xce\xbcs, respectively. On the basis of the observation of these intermediates, their properties, and the reactant reactivities, a mechanism of the photohomolytic bond cleavage of carbon\xe2\x88\x92halogen followed by radical arylation and hydrogen ejection is proposed for the intramolecular photocyclization of haloarene tethered arenes in water.

"5-Methylcytosine is a minor nucleobase of eukaryotic DNA which plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression. UV-A irradiation of an aerated aqueous solution of 5-methyl-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxycytidine in the presence of menadione (MQ) as a type I photosensitizer leads to the formation of several stable oxidation products. Emphasis was placed in this study on the isolation and the characterization of the major class of decomposition products whose formation involves the oxidation of the methyl group. These include 5-(hydroperoxymethyl)-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxycytidine and two stable decomposition products namely, 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxycytidine and 5-formyl-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxycytidine. Structural assignment of the latter modified nucleosides was inferred from extensive spectroscopic measurements (1H and 13C NMR, UV spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry). In addition, conformational analysis of the oxidized nucleosides was inferred from detailed 1H NMR analysis. All of the above photooxidation products appear to arise from the deprotonation of the 5-methyl-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxycytidine radical cation which is generated by menadione photosensitization. "
"The photophysical properties and photochemistry of (E)-4-cyano-4\xe2\x80\x98-(pentamethyldisilanyl)stilbene ((E)-3) and the corresponding monosilylated stilbene (E)-5 have been studied. Solvatochromic plots of (E)-3 show separate slopes for ether solvents and halocarbons. The emission in ethers is assigned to an LE state of similar polarity to that of (E)-5. In halocarbons a more polar intramolecular charge transfer (CT) state apparently contributes to the emission. This component is completely quenched by nucleophilic ethers. In contrast to (E)-5, \xce\xa6f and \xce\xa6(E,Z) of (E)-3 strongly decrease in CH3CN, consistent with the solvent polarity induced LE \xe2\x86\x92 CT process and nucleophilic quenching of the CT state by solvent. Alcohols also quench \xce\xa6f and \xce\xa6(E,Z) with similar Stern\xe2\x88\x92Volmer constants, linking the two processes to the same state (LE). Such quenching results in formation of (E)-4\xe2\x80\x98-(hydrodimethylsilyl)-4-cyanostilbene (4) by regioselective nucleophilic cleavage of the Si\xe2\x88\x92Si bond, according to deuterium labeling studies. Double reciprocal plots of \xce\xa6-1(SiH) vs [ROH]-1 are consistent with both the LE and CT states being quenched by ROH with the latter state giving (E)-4. Quadratic behavior for MeOH in CH2Cl2 is ascribed to a solvent polarity promoted LE \xe2\x86\x92 CT process with a rate constant \xe2\x88\x9d [MeOH], in accord with the linear relation of ET(30) vs ln [MeOH] above 0.3 M MeOH. The quadratic behavior disappears in tert-amyl alcohol, which has the same ET(30) as CH2Cl2. Results for MeOH in pentane suggest the LE and CT states have similar energies and interconvert. "
"Synthesis and structural studies, employing combined NMR, X-ray crystallographic, and ab initio/IGLO/NMR methods, of a variety of new subicosahedral carboranes with adjacent cage carbons are reported. Acetonitrile-induced cage degradation of arachno-4,5-C2B7H12- gave nido-4,5-C2B6H9- (1-) in nearly quantitative yield, which can then be protonated to give the neutral carborane nido-4,5-C2B6H10 (1) in good yield. Both of these nido electron-count clusters are shown to have an arachno-type geometry, i.e. a six-membered open face. The nido-4,5-C2B6H10 (1) hydroborated alkenes or alkynes which following deprotonation gave nido-7-R-4,5-C2B6H8- (2a-\xe2\x88\x92c-) ions. Both nido-4,5-C2B6H9- (1-) and nido-4,5-C2B6H10 (1) serve as useful precursors to other adjacent cage-carbon clusters. Thus, nido-4,5-C2B6H9- (1-) reacted with BH3\xc2\xb7THF to give arachno-5,6-C2B7H12- (3-) which a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study showed is the first carborane to adopt the n-B9H15 cage geometry. Thermal or chemical degradation of nido-4,5-C2B6H10 (1) gave closo-2,3-C2B5H7 (5) in good to moderate yields. The nido-4,5-C2B6H9- (1-) was also found prone to lose a cage boron as evidenced by its reactions with (\xce\xb7-C5H5)Co(CO)I2 and (\xce\xb76-C6Me6)2Ru2Cl4 which gave closo-3,1,2-(\xce\xb7-C5H5)CoC2B5H7 (6) and closo-3,1,2-(\xce\xb76-C6Me6)RuC2B5H7 (7), respectively. NMR studies showed the nido-4,5-C2B6H10 (1) was converted to arachno-4,5-C2B6H11- by reaction with LiEt3BH, and an alkyl derivative, arachno-7-CH3-4,5-C2B6H10- (4-), was formed by reacting MeLi with nido-4,5-C2B6H9- (1-) followed by protonation. The closo-2,3-C2B5H7 (5) was also converted in high yields to the smaller nido carborane, nido-2,3-C2B4H8, via reaction with TMEDA/H2O, and to nido-3,4-C2B5H8- (8-) by reaction with LiEt3BH. "
"The rate constants and the yields of the products of the nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions of 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-3-butyl derivatives (1-X) have been determined in mostly aqueous solvents, and the absolute rate constant for reaction of the simple tertiary carbocation 1+ in 50:50 (v/v) trifluoroethanol/water has been estimated as ks = 3.5 \xc3\x97 1012 s-1. Product studies show that the acid-catalyzed reactions of 1-OH and 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-methyl-1-butene (2) do not proceed exclusively through a common carbocation intermediate 1+. The observed formation of small amounts of the azide ion adduct 1-N3 likely occurs by a preassociation reaction mechanism. The reactions of 1-Cl and 1-O2CC6F5 in 50:50 (v/v) trifluoroethanol/water give 39% and 56%, respectively, of the alkene products of elimination, and the yields of the alkenes are unaffected by the addition of 0.50 M of the good nucleophile N3-. This result is consistent with a concerted unimolecular mechanism for the elimination reactions of 1-X. "
"Rate constants ( ) for the deprotonation of 2-nitro-4-X-phenylacetonitrile, 2-X (X = NO2, SO2CH3, CN, CF3, Br, and Cl) by piperidine and morpholine and for the reverse reaction ( ) have been determined in 90% Me2SO\xe2\x88\x9210% water, 50% Me2SO\xe2\x88\x9250% water, and water (X = NO2, SO2CH3, CN only). Br\xc3\xb8nsted \xce\xb2B values (dlog /dp ), Br\xc3\xb8nsted \xce\xb1CH values (dlog /dlog ), and intrinsic rate constants (log ko = log(k1/q) for p \xe2\x88\x92 p + log(p/q) = 0) were calculated from these data. \xce\xb1CH is smaller than \xce\xb2B, implying an imbalance which is consistent with a transition state in which delocalization of the negative charge into the 2-nitrophenyl moiety lags behind proton transfer. A consequence of this imbalance is that the intrinsic rate constant decreases with increasing electron withdrawing strength of X. For \xcf\x80-acceptor substituents (NO2, SO2CH3, CN) there is a further decrease in ko due to a lag in the delocalization of the charge into X. The intrinsic rate constants depend very little on the Me2SO content of the solvent which is shown to be the result of compensation of mainly two competing factors. One is the stabilization of the polarizable transition state by the polarizable Me2SO which increases ko; the other is attributed to a lag in the solvation of the developing carbanion behind proton transfer at the transition state which leads to a decrease in ko.

"3He NMR spectrometry has been used to examine bisaddition to C60 containing an encapsulated 3He atom (3He@C60) using three types of reactions:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) cyclopropanation with diethyl bromomalonate and base to give dicarbethoxymethanofullerenes (Bingel\xe2\x88\x92Hirsch reaction), (b) addition of azomethine ylides to give N-methylfulleropyrrolidines (Prato\xe2\x88\x92Wudl reaction), and (c) reduction to give C60H4. 3He NMR spectra of crude reaction mixtures in all three series showed well-separated resonances for each of the bisadducts, spread out over more than 2 ppm. The major isomeric bisadducts from the first two reactions were separated and characterized, and the 3He NMR spectra of the individual major bisadducts from 3He@C60 were obtained (five isomers from reaction 1, four isomers from reaction 2). Although the absolute chemical shifts in the two series of bisadducts differ, the relative chemical shifts are significantly but not perfectly correlated. Bisadducts with appended ligands on opposite hemispheres of C60 (7, 6, and 5) tend to have 3He NMR resonances downfield of the bisadducts with appended ligands on the same hemisphere (bisadducts 2 and 3). Unfortunately, the equatorial isomer 4, a major product from the Hirsch addition reaction, was not obtained in sufficient quantity for study from the Prato reaction. Well-separated resonances were also seen for the isomeric compounds of composition 3He@C60H4 from reaction of the fullerene with diimide, but the individual isomers were not separated. The very large differences in the 3He NMR chemical shifts of the isomeric bisadducts in all three reactions demonstrate that the magnetic field felt by the 3He atom due to the ring currents in the residual \xcf\x80-system is extremely sensitive to the pattern of ligation on the C60 surface. These results provide further support for the assertion that 3He NMR is a very sensitive probe of patterns of chemical addition to fullerenes, and suggest that this technique will prove to be generally useful in determining the ratio as well as the identity of isomeric fullerene bisadducts.

"Optically active and inactive rotational isomers of 9-(1,1-dimethyl-3-butenyl)-11,12-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-9,10-dihydro-9,10-ethenoanthracene were isolated. The absolute conformations of these optically active conformers were determined by correlating them with those of camphorsultam amides of 9-(2-carboxy-1,1-dimethylethyl)-11,12-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-9,10-dihydro-9,10-ethenoanthracenes, the latter being determined by X-ray analysis. From the carboxylic acids, the title compounds, in which the halogen is a chloro, a bromo, or an iodo, were prepared. The CD spectra of the title compounds showed remote substituent effects on the Cotton effect at ca. 220 nm. "
"The efficiency of exchange between the mediating nitroxide moieties at the termini of growing polymer chains during \xe2\x80\x9cliving\xe2\x80\x9d free radical polymerizations has been probed by a series of crossover experiments using functionalized unimolecular initiators. The design of appropriately substituted initiators permitted the synthesis of specifically functionalized model polymers which could be readily distinguished using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Using these models, the mixture of macromolecules obtained from a 1:1 combination of disparate initiators was separated and identified. The results reveal that exchange of the mediating nitroxide free radicals is a facile process and at essentially all stages of the polymerization a nearly statistical mixture of crossover products is obtained. The HPLC techniques developed are also useful in evaluating the extent of chain termination in nitroxide mediated \xe2\x80\x9cliving\xe2\x80\x9d free radical polymerizations. "
"Rate and equilibrium constants have been determined for both the aldol addition and the elimination steps in the intramolecular condensation reactions of 2,5-hexanedione, 2,6-heptanedione, 1-phenyl-1,5-hexanedione, and 5-oxohexanal. The overall thermodynamics are similar for cyclization of 2,5-hexanedione and 2,6-heptanedione; conversion of 2,5-hexanedione to the corresponding enone is actually more favorable, but the cyclization of 2,5-hexanedione is 2400 times slower than that of 2,6-heptanedione. As expected on the basis of intermolecular analogs, the addition step is less favorable and slower for 1-phenyl-1,5-hexanedione, and the addition step for 5-oxohexanal is more favorable though similar in rate to that for heptanedione. Detailed analysis of the kinetics and equilibrium for all of these compounds, as well as 2-(2-oxopropyl)benzaldehyde, in terms of Marcus theory, leads to the same intrinsic barriers for the intramolecular reactions as were seen previously for the intermolecular reactions. This means that rate constants for intramolecular aldol reactions should be predictable from the energetics of the reactions and that the effective molarity can be calculated. Methods for estimating thermodynamic quantities for reactants and products of these reactions have been examined. "
"The total synthesis of the Hakomori MBr1 antigen, heavily expressed on human breast tumors, is related. The construction involved the assembly of four glycals:\xe2\x80\x89 (17 (twice), 18, 20, and 26) and an l-fucose derivative, 34. The sensitivity of the stereochemistry of sulfonamido galactosylation by a terminal galactose ring as a function of the state of protection status of its C4 alcohol was exploited in a key step. (See the formation of compound 51.) The synthesis served to confirm the Hakomori assignment of structure, and paves the way for immunoconjugation. (See compound 64.) "
"CuA, an electron transfer center present in cytochrome c oxidase, COX, and nitrous oxide reductase, N2OR, is a dimeric copper complex with four ligands, two cysteine thiols bridging the metal ions and two terminal histidine residues. The center cycles between the mixed-valence state [Cu(I),Cu(II)] and the reduced state [Cu(I),Cu(I)]. The EPR, optical absorption, low-temperature magnetic circular dichroism, and CD spectra of three proteins containing the mixed-valence state of CuA have been measured between 33\xe2\x80\x89000 and 5000 cm-1. These results point to two forms of the chromophore, one in the enzyme N2OR of Pseudomonas stutzeri, lacking its catalytic center, and also in a water soluble domain of subunit II of Paracoccus denitrificans COX and the other, referred to as CuA*, in a site engineered into a soluble domain of subunit II of the quinol oxidase in Escherichia coli. An assignment of the electronic spectrum has been made in terms of a covalent planar core [Cu2(SR)2]+ with a Cu\xe2\x88\x92S distance of 2.2 \xc3\x85, a Cu\xe2\x88\x92Cu distance of 2.5 \xc3\x85, and a Cu\xe2\x88\x92S\xe2\x88\x92Cu angle of 70\xc2\xb0. Molecular orbitals arising from five 3d orbitals on each copper and two lone-pair thiolate orbitals on each cysteine ligand divide into three sets, four bonding (with respect to the Cu\xe2\x88\x92S interaction) orbitals at lower energy, four antibonding orbitals at higher energy, and six intermediate nonbonding orbitals. The inversion center of the copper core imposes rather strict selection rules giving rise to two pairs of allowed electronic transitions, polarized along either the S\xe2\x88\x92S or the Cu\xe2\x88\x92Cu axis. A delocalization energy of \xe2\x88\xbc4500 cm-1 can be estimated from the data, which is at least 1 order of magnitude larger than the vibrational energies of the core, accounting for the stability of the class III or delocalized mixed-valence form. The CuA sites in COX and N2OR have essentially identical electronic structures with complete delocalization. However, the CuA* site shows partial trapping of the valences. The close approach, to \xe2\x88\xbc2.3 \xc3\x85, of the backbone carbonyl group of a conserved glutamic acid residue is proposed to be responsible for this partial localization. CuA is a highly covalent planar rhomb which provides an effective path, with low reorganization energy, for electron transfer across subunit II from cytochrome c to the cytochromes a and possibly a3 of COX.

"Four valence tautomeric complexes with the general composition [Co(3,5-DTBSQ)2(N\xe2\x8c\x92N)] have been investigated, where 3,5-DTBSQ- is the semiquinonate form of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-o-quinone. The diiminium ligand N\xe2\x8c\x92N is one of the following ligands: phen (1,10-phenanthroline, complex 1); bpy (2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine, complex 2); dmbpy (4,4\xe2\x80\x98-dimethyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine, complex 3); dpbpy (4,4\xe2\x80\x98-diphenyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine, complex 4). All four of the complexes undergo a valence tautomerism converting from low-spin (ls) [CoIII(3,5-DTBSQ)(3,5-DTBCAT)(N\xe2\x8c\x92N)] at low temperatures to high-spin (hs) [CoII(3,5-DTBSQ)2(N\xe2\x8c\x92N)] at high temperatures, where the 3,5-DTBCAT2- ligand is the catecholate form of the o-quinone ligand. Variable temperature (150\xe2\x88\x92340 K) magnetic susceptibility data are presented for toluene solutions of all four complexes. These data were least-squares fit to give \xce\x94H and \xce\x94S values that characterize the valence tautomerism equilibrium. The \xce\x94H values range from 21.33 to 38.36 kJ mol-1, whereas the \xce\x94S values range from 60.6 to 133.8 J mol-1 K-1. Analogous to FeII spin crossover complexes, the cobalt valence tautomerism is an entropy driven process. Electronic and vibrational (changes in metal\xe2\x88\x92ligand and ligand-based vibrations) entropy contributions are present that drive the ls-[CoIII(SQ)(Cat)] to hs-[CoII(SQ)2] conversion when the temperature is increased. Variable temperature electronic absorption spectra (320\xe2\x88\x92820 nm) are presented for the complexes in toluene solution and for polystyrene-doped samples. The presence of isosbestic points indicates only two species are present. Optical spectra show that, compared to the situation in toluene solution, doping the cobalt tautomeric complexes into polystyrene leads to stabilization of the smaller ls-CoIII tautomer. Pulsed laser photolysis, both on the picosecond (90 ps pulse) and the nanosecond (24 ns pulse) time scales, were carried out for solutions of the complexes. The laser pulse into the 600 nm band of the ls-CoIII tautomer excites the complex to a ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited state. Some molecules rapidly intersystem cross to the hs-CoII state. The rate of back valence tautomerization, kbvt, for conversion from the hs-CoII to the ls-CoIII state can be measured. At room temperature in toluene solution, kbvt was determined with picosecond spectroscopy to be 6.08 \xc3\x97 107 s-1 for complex 3 and 6.71 \xc3\x97 108 s-1 for complex 4. Since no indication of a rise time was seen, the hs-CoII state is formed within the experimental resolution of 90 ps. The observation of a bleach and an absorption with identical kinetics when the probe wavelength is moved to either side of an isosbestic point confirms that the hs-CoII to ls-CoIII conversion is being monitored. Nanosecond laser spectroscopy was used to determine the temperature dependence of kbvt. For complex 4 in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, data were collected in the 110.5\xe2\x88\x92198.1 K range. There is evidence of a change from an Arrhenius-type behavior to a temperature-independent rate below \xe2\x88\xbc132 K. The quantum mechanical theory of radiationless transitions of Buhks and Jortner was used to fit the temperature dependence of kbvt. It appears the hs-CoII to ls-CoIII valence tautomerism may occur by quantum mechanical tunneling. "
"Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements were performed on zirconium acidic aqueous solutions to investigate the structure and the size of polynuclear species larger than the previously identified tetrameric species. Solutions with [H+]added and [OH-]added ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 M and 0.0 to 0.02 M, respectively, were analyzed. This study demonstrates that an octameric species, Zr8(OH)20(H2O)24Cl12, exists in equilibrium with the tetrameric species, Zr4(OH)8(H2O)16Cl62+, such that, for 0.05 M Zr(IV) in highly acidic solutions ([H+]added \xe2\x89\xa5 0.6 M), the tetramer is the dominant species; and at conditions with [H+]added \xe2\x89\xa4 0.05 M, the octameric species becomes predominant. The estimated value of the equilibrium quotient obtained for the tetramer/octamer equilibrium is 0.20 \xc2\xb1 0.05 M3. The tetramer and octamer have radii of gyration of 3.8 and 5.1 \xc2\xb1 0.2 \xc3\x85 and a hydrolysis ratio of 2.0 and 2.5, respectively. The octamer forms by stacking two tetramers on top of each other. At conditions where small amounts of NaOH are added, unidentified polymeric Zr(IV) species larger in size than the octameric species appear. "

"4-Metalloidal (MMe3, M = Si and Sn)-substituted bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-1-yl triflates (1, Y = OSO2CF3) have been synthesized and their solvolyses in aqueous ethanol and trifluoroethanol have been examined together with those of the parent and methyl derivatives (1,Y = OSO2CF3; X = H and Me, respectively). Large rate enhancement factors are observed for the metalloidal substituents. A comparison of these accelerative effects with the corresponding values in the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane and adamantane ring systems (2, Y = OSO2Me, and 3, Y = Br, respectively) indicates the substrate order of these effects is 1 > 2 \xe2\x89\xab 3. Qualitative considerations lead to the pronounced effects in 1 being ascribed to \xe2\x80\x9cback-lobe\xe2\x80\x9d through-space effects (homohyperconjugation). A more quantitative picture of the stabilizing effects of SiMe3 and SnMe3 on the 1-norbornyl cation (5) is painted by high-level ab initio (MP2/6-31G(d)[DZP]) molecular orbital calculations. The calculations provide strong support for the homohyperconjugative stabilizing effects of these groups but indicate that the weak accelerative effect of 4-methyl in 1 (Y = OSO2CF3, X = Me) is more likely a manifestation of dominant destabilizing ground-state effects. Furthermore, the high-level calculations expose that the usual practice of theoretical modeling of SiMe3 by use of SiH3 to reduce the complexity of the computational problem can be seriously inadequate.

"The dummy atom formalism, originally proposed by Doman, Landis, and Bosnich for metallocenes, has been generalized in order to deal with any kind of \xcf\x80-bonding ligands and cluster faces (which can also be seen as polyhapto moieties). A modified VESCF approach has been used to derive a general force field for \xce\xb7n-coordinated \xcf\x80-bonding ligands whose performances are comparable with those of the best current force fields for cyclopentadienyl derivatives but can be used also for \xce\xbc3-\xce\xb72:\xce\xb72:\xce\xb72 and even complex coordination modes. This approach, which can be considered a further step in the building up of a general force field for metal (carbonyl) clusters, has been tested by rationalizing the dynamic stereochemistry in solution of two classes of triangular clusters:\xe2\x80\x89 M3L3(CO)3 (M = Co, Rh, Ir; L = \xce\xb75-Cp, \xce\xb75-Cp*, \xce\xb75-Ind) and Co3(\xce\xb75-Cp)3(\xce\xbc3-\xce\xb72:\xce\xb72:\xce\xb72-RR\xe2\x80\x98C6H4) (R = R\xe2\x80\x98 = H, Me, Et and R = Me, Et, iPr; R\xe2\x80\x98 = H).

"A description of the structure and bonding of novel bis(\xce\xbc-oxo)dicopper complexes and their bis(\xce\xbc-hydroxo)dicopper decomposition products was derived from combined X-ray crystallographic, spectroscopic, and ab initio theoretical studies. The compounds [(LCu)2(\xce\xbc-O)2]X2 were generated from the reaction of solutions of [LCu(CH3CN)]X with O2 at \xe2\x88\x9280 \xc2\xb0C (L = 1,4,7-tribenzyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, LBn3; 1,4,7-triisopropyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, LiPr3; or 1-benzyl-4,7-diisopropyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, LiPr2Bn; X = variety of anions). The geometry of the [Cu2(\xce\xbc-O)2]2+ core was defined by X-ray crystallography for [(d21-LBn3Cu)2(\xce\xbc-O)2](SbF6)2 and by EXAFS spectroscopy for the complexes capped by LBn3 and LiPr3; notable dimensions include short Cu\xe2\x88\x92O (\xe2\x88\xbc1.80 \xc3\x85) and Cu\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Cu (\xe2\x88\xbc2.80 \xc3\x85) distances like those reported for analogous M2(\xce\xbc-O)2 (M = Fe or Mn) rhombs. The core geometry is contracted compared to those of the bis(\xce\xbc-hydroxo)dicopper(II) compounds that result from decomposition of the bis(\xce\xbc-oxo) complexes upon warming. X-ray structures of the decomposition products [(LBn3Cu)(LBn2HCu)(\xce\xbc-OH)2](O3SCF3)2\xc2\xb72CH3CO, [(LiPr2HCu)2(\xce\xbc-OH)2](BPh4)2\xc2\xb72THF, and [(LiPr2BnCu)2(\xce\xbc-OH)2](O3SCF3)2 showed that they arise from N-dealkylation of the original capping macrocycles. Manometric, electrospray mass spectrometric, and UV\xe2\x88\x92vis, EPR, NMR, and resonance Raman spectroscopic data for the bis(\xce\xbc-oxo)dicopper complexes in solution revealed important topological and electronic structural features of the intact [Cu2(\xce\xbc-O)2]2+ core. The bis(\xce\xbc-oxo)dicopper unit is diamagnetic, undergoes a rapid fluxional process involving interchange of equatorial and axial N-donor ligand environments, and exhibits a diagnostic \xe2\x88\xbc600 cm-1 18O-sensitive feature in Raman spectra. Ab initio calculations on a model system, {[(NH3)3Cu]2(\xce\xbc-O)2}2+, predicted a closed-shell singlet ground-state structure that agrees well with the bis(\xce\xbc-oxo)dicopper geometry determined by experiment and helps to rationalize many of its physicochemical properties. On the basis of an analysis of the theoretical and experimental results (including a bond valence sum analysis), a formal oxidation level assignment for the core is suggested to be [CuIII2(\xce\xbc-O2-)2]2+, although a more complete molecular orbital description indicates that the oxygen and copper fragment orbitals are significantly mixed (i.e., there is a high degree of covalency).

"The results of experiments designed to probe the mechanism by which the bis(\xce\xbc-oxo)dicopper complexes [(LCu)2(\xce\xbc-O)2](ClO4)2 (L = 1,4,7-tribenzyl-, 1,4,7-triisopropyl-, and 1,4-diisopropyl-7-benzyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane ligands; LBn3, LiPr3, and LiPr2Bn, respectively) decompose to products arising from macrocyclic ligand N-dealkylation are described. After removal of copper from the decomposed solutions, analysis of the organic products revealed N-dealkylated ligands and aldehyde or ketone, the oxygen atoms in the latter being derived from the bis(\xce\xbc-oxo)dicopper core as shown by 18O-isotope labeling experiments. Thus, the overall N-dealkylation is akin to monooxygenase reactions carried out by various metalloenzymes such as cytochrome P450, dopamine \xce\xb2-monooxygenase, and peptidyl glycine \xce\xb1-amidating monooxygenase. Direct, intramolecular attack of the bis(\xce\xbc-oxo)dicopper core at a ligand substituent C\xe2\x88\x92H bond during the rate-determining step was indicated by the observed first-order kinetics, the results of H/D- and 16O/18O-isotope and double labeling experiments, large primary kinetic deuterium isotope effects (KIEs), and Eyring activation parameters. Tunneling was implicated in the C\xe2\x88\x92H bond cleavage step by the temperature dependence of the KIEs. A Hammett study of the decay of suitably functionalized derivatives of LBn3 revealed a \xcf\x81 value of \xe2\x88\x920.8, consistent with the diamagnetic bis(\xce\xbc-oxo)dicopper core behaving as an electrophile during C\xe2\x88\x92H bond scission like the active oxidant in cytochrome P450. Subsequent hydroxyl \xe2\x80\x9crebound\xe2\x80\x9d or a concerted mechanism is then proposed to generate a carbinolamine intermediate that decomposes to secondary amine and ketone or aldehyde final products.

"In the presence of molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, inorganic phosphate catalyzes the conversion of 3-dehydroshikimic acid (DHS) into gallic acid. Other products formed in the reaction of DHS with oxygen include protocatechuic acid, tricarballylic acid, and pyrogallol. With hydrogen peroxide as oxidant, pyrogallol formation is not observed, and smaller amounts of tricarballylic acid are produced. Evidence favoring a mechanism involving phosphate-catalyzed tautomerization of DHS to a reactive enediol intermediate follows from the successful isolation of dihydrogallic acid when oxidant is excluded from phosphate-buffered solutions of DHS. The reductone-like solution chemistry of DHS and the radical quenching reactivity of the phenolics formed from DHS prompted an appraisal of DHS antioxidant activity. Based on two different analyses, DHS was discovered to possess significant antioxidant activity relative to \xce\xb1-tocopherol, gallic acid, propyl gallate, and tert-butylhydroquinone. "
"The abstractions of hydrogen from both carbon and oxygen in acetic acid by hydride, fluoride, and hydroxide anions have been studied using ab initio electronic structure calculations. Molecular structures were optimized at the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock level of theory using the 6-31++G(d,p) basis set. For energetics, the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set was used, with second- and fourth-order perturbation theory corrections, for both minima and transition states. For the hydride and fluoride ion abstractions of hydrogen from carbon, a small activation energy exists at the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock level, but vanishes when correlation energy corrections are introduced. No other barriers are found for the abstraction reactions, but intermediate minima are found on the F- + CH3COOH \xe2\x86\x92 FH + -CH2COOH surface and on the analogous OH- + CH3COOH surface. The calculated heats of formation for both acetic acid anions are in good agreement with the experimental values. The fourth-order perturbation theory calculation of the activation energy for the isomerization of acetate to enolate ion is 50.4 kcal/mol. The G2 values for the gas phase acidities of acetic acid at the OH and CH ends of the molecule are 339.3 and 365.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The former result is in good agreement with experiment. "
"A comparative investigation of the surface reaction of ethylene with clean Mo(110) and carbide-modified Mo(110) has been carried out using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD). As typically observed for early transition metals, the clean Mo(110) surface interacts very strongly with ethylene, as indicated by the decomposition of ethylene to produce C2H2 surface species at temperatures as low as 80 K. The surface acetylene species further decompose to atomic carbon and hydrogen at higher temperatures. The strong reactivity of the Mo(110) surface can be modified by the formation of carbide. The surface reactivity is modified in such a way that the reaction mechanism of ethylene on C/Mo(110) is very similar to those typically observed on Pt-group metal surfaces:\xe2\x80\x89 At 80 K, ethylene molecules bond to the C/Mo(110) surface in the di-\xcf\x83 bonded configuration; a new surface reaction intermediate, which can be best described as ethylidyne species, is detected in the temperature range of 260\xe2\x88\x92350 K. In addition, the interaction of ethylene with oxygen-modified Mo(110) is also compared to reveal the different modification effects of carbon and oxygen adatoms on the reactivities of Mo(110). The oxygen-modified Mo(110) surface is found to be inert toward the decomposition of ethylene, as indicated by the formation of weakly adsorbed \xcf\x80-bonded ethylene species at 80 K and by the reversible molecular desorption at higher temperatures.

"The energy- and electron-transfer quenching processes of the lowest triplet excited state of biacetyl (2,3-butanedione) imprisoned in a hemicarcerand have been systematically investigated in CH2Cl2 solution at room temperature. Twenty potential quenchers have been used, including ten triplet energy acceptors (mostly, aromatic hydrocarbons) and nine electron donors (mostly, aromatic amines). Bimolecular rate constants for the quenching processes were obtained by Stern\xe2\x88\x92Volmer analysis and compared with those found for the quenching of free biacetyl. In the electron-transfer processes, aromatic amines with oxidation potential from +0.015 V (N,N,N\xe2\x80\x98,N\xe2\x80\x98-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine) to +0.83 V (diphenylamine) quench free biacetyl at the diffusion-controlled limit, whereas for imprisoned biacetyl the rate constant decreases (roughly in a linear manner) from 4.0 \xc3\x97 108 to 1.2 \xc3\x97 105 M-1 s-1. As far as energy-transfer is concerned, the rate constant for the quenching of free biacetyl increases with decreasing \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0 and reaches the diffusion-controlled plateau value (kq \xe2\x88\xbc 1010 M-1 s-1) for \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0 \xe2\x88\xbc \xe2\x88\x920.1 eV, whereas for imprisoned biacetyl a scattered, bell-shaped log kq vs \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0 plot is obtained, with a maximum value (\xe2\x88\xbc106 M-1 s-1) much below the diffusion-controlled limit. The results obtained show that the walls of the hemicarcerand allow only very weak electronic interaction between incarcerated triplet biacetyl and external quenchers. A brief discussion of the results obtained in the light of current energy- and electron-transfer theories is presented. "
"The formation of [C(SH)3]+ (a) by hydride abstraction from HC(SH)3 and its oxidation to the radical dication [C(SH)3]\xe2\x80\xa2,2+ (b) were studied to examine the potential of stabilizing carbenium ions via trithio substitution. Potential energy surfaces (PES) were explored at the HF/6-31G* level and energies were refined at the (P)MP4(full,sdtq)/6-31G* level without and with annihilation of spin contaminations. The unpaired \xcf\x80-electron in the radical lies well below the Fermi level and spin polarization and dynamic electron correlation become important. Open Y-conjugated structures 1 (C3h or Cs) and their rotamers 2 (Cs) are favored. Four cyclic, S\xe2\x88\x92S connected, distonic, chiral stereoisomers 3b are local minima for the radical dication. The C\xe2\x88\x92S rotational barriers to isomerization via 4 and automerization via 5 (two isomeric TSs) and the high energies of C3v models 6 indicate stronger S\xe2\x88\x92C \xcf\x80-interactions in the cations 1 and 2 than in the dications. C3h-1b undergoes a Jahn\xe2\x88\x92Teller distortion to Cs-1b\xe2\x80\x98 but pseudorotation is facile. The PES analyses suggest two strategies to achieve pyramidalization of the trivalent carbon in heteroatom-substituted carbenium ions via X\xe2\x88\x92X interactions in CX3n+ or via face-preferential hyperconjugation. The basic approach was found to be successful:\xe2\x80\x89 The computed hydride affinity of 1a is \xce\x94HA = 95.5 kcal/mol lower than for CH3+. \xce\x94HA was partitioned into a methane destabilization of 32.0 kcal/mol and a carbenium ion stabilization of 63.5 kcal/mol. Our best estimate for the ionization energy of 1a is IP(1a) = 343.8 kcal/mol (14.9 eV) and results in \xce\x94Hf(1b) = 541.5 kcal/mol. The cations [C(SH)3]+ and [C(SH)3]\xe2\x80\xa2,2+ show the same unexpected electronic motif. Strong S\xe2\x86\x92C donations occur in the \xcf\x80- and \xcf\x83-systems and, instead of charge dispersal, large positive SH charges are arranged around a negative C center. The stabilization mechanisms in the S-containing ions and the lighter O homologues are fundamentally different due to the umpolung of the C\xe2\x88\x92X bonds. Oxidation of [C(SH)3]+ removes S-\xcf\x80-electron density and increases the \xcf\x80-acidity of the C atom. The \xce\xb1-spin density is concentrated on the S atoms and carbon is \xce\xb2-spin polarized. "
"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in solution has a unique potential for providing novel insights into structural and dynamic aspects of the solvation of biological macromolecules such as proteins, which is based on the observation of intermolecular solvent\xe2\x88\x92protein nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) in the laboratory frame and the rotating frame. In these experiments spectral overlap between resonance lines of the solvent and the macromolecule may make the distinction between certain water\xe2\x88\x92protein and protein\xe2\x88\x92protein NOEs ambiguous even in two- and higher-dimensional NMR experiments. Here we show that use of diffusion filters in NOE difference experiments enables the observation of hydration water molecules without interference from intramolecular NOEs. Water\xe2\x88\x92protein NOEs can thus be unambiguously identified from measurements at a single set of solution conditions. The proposed approach works well also with very short mixing times, and the resulting spectra are easy to analyze. One-dimensional experiments with diffusion filters have been combined with higher-dimensional experiments to obtain the chemical shift dispersion needed for individual resonance assignments. "
"Onchidin B (4) is a cyclic depsipeptide isolated from the pulmonate mollusc Onchidium sp. Its structure was determined by extensive 2D-NMR, FABMS, tandem FAB MS/MS, selective hydrolysis, and synthesis. It contains four \xce\xb1-amino acids [two units of N-methyl valine (MeVal), two units of proline (Pro)], four \xce\xb1-hydroxy acids [two 2-hydroxyisovaleric acids (Hiv), two 2-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid moieties (Hmp)] and two units of the new \xce\xb2-hydroxy acid:\xe2\x80\x89 3-hydroxy-2-methyloct-7-ynoic acid (Hymo)]. Selective hydrolysis and direct comparison by chiral GC-MS with authentic samples of the \xce\xb1-amino and \xce\xb1-hydroxy acids allowed us the assignment of the entire absolute stereochemistry of onchidin B. In this way, the \xce\xb1-hydroxy acids were found to be (S)-Hiv and (S,S)-Hmp, and the \xce\xb1-amino acids (R)-proline, (S)-proline, and (R)-MeVal. In order to establish the absolute configuration of the new \xce\xb2-hydroxy acid, Hymo, its four possible stereoisomers were stereoselectively synthesized using chiral N-propionyl oxazolidinones and hex-5-ynal as starting material. Comparison by HPLC-MS of the synthetic samples with the natural Hymo (all derivatized as esters of (\xe2\x88\x92)-(R)-\xce\xb1-methoxy-\xce\xb1-(9-anthryl)acetic acid), affirmed its absolute stereochemistry as (2R,3R). Thus, onchidin B (4) is cyclo [(R)-MeVal-(R,R)-Hymo-(S)-Pro-(S,S)-Hmp-(S)-Hiv-(R)-MeVal-(R,R)-Hymo-(R)-Pro-(S,S)-Hmp-(S)-Hiv]. It is formed by a head-to-tail linkage of two halves, each one built by five units and identical sequence. The lack of symmetry of onchidin B is thus due to the presence of one (S)-Pro unit in one half and one (R)-Pro unit in the other. The structural similarity between onchidin B (4) and onchidin (2), both isolated from the same organism, and between the \xce\xb2-hydroxy acid Hymo (5) and the \xce\xb2-amino acid Amo (3) found in onchidin is noticed.

"The crystal structure at room temperature of the solvated iron\xe2\x88\x92sulfur synthetic compound (Et4N)3[Fe4S4(SCH2Ph)4]\xc2\xb7DMF has been determined. The conformation of four ligand branches CH2Ph linked to the Fe4S8 unit is very disturbed in contrast with the much more symmetrical situation in the already known nonsolvated compound. The paramagnetic core [Fe4S4]+ has been studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) at a few kelvins in single crystals:\xe2\x80\x89 it has an S = 1/2 ground state in contrast with the S = 3/2 ground state in the nonsolvated compound. It is the first S = 1/2 ground state studied in a single crystal for an iron\xe2\x88\x92sulfur synthetic compound and has g values of 2.027, 1.930, and 1.904 and principal directions near the three normals to opposite \xe2\x80\x9cfaces\xe2\x80\x9d of the cubane [Fe4S4]+. Polycrystalline EPR studies were done to observe alterations of the product but also are analyzed in relation with previous frozen solution studies. "
"FTIR spectroscopy was used to quantitatively assess the secondary structure of proteins in aqueous\xe2\x88\x92organic mixtures ranging from pure water to a pure solvent. For every such solution/suspension, the \xce\xb1-helix content of the protein was independently calculated from the amide I and amide III spectral regions (which gave essentially identical results). In all cases studied (two unrelated enzymic proteinslysozyme and subtilisin; three dissimilar water-miscible solventsacetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, and 1-propanol), the protein secondary structure was much more native-like in pure organic solvents than in most water\xe2\x88\x92solvent mixtures, e.g., 60% (v/v) organic solvents. In fact, placing lyophilized (or crystalline) proteins in the anhydrous solvents tested had no appreciable effect on the \xce\xb1-helix content, whereas the latter declined markedly in the 60% (v/v) solvents. This behavior was found to be kinetically controlled, i.e., to be due to inherent restrictions on protein conformational mobility in anhydrous, in contrast to aqueous\xe2\x88\x92organic, media. "
"DNA ligation by DNA topoisomerase I was investigated employing synthetic DNA substrates containing a single strand nick. Site-specific cleavage of the DNA by topoisomerase I in proximity to the nick resulted in uncoupling of the cleavage and ligation reactions of the enzyme, thereby trapping the covalent enzyme\xe2\x88\x92DNA intermediate. DNA cleavage could be reversed by the addition of acceptor oligonucleotides containing a free 5\xe2\x80\x98-OH group and capable of hybridizing to the noncleaved strand of the \xe2\x80\x9csuicide substrates\xe2\x80\x9d. Utilizing acceptors with partial complementarity, modification of nucleic acid structure has been obtained. Modifications included the formation of DNA insertions, deletions, and mismatches. To further evaluate the potential of topoisomerase I to mediate structural transformations of DNA, acceptor oligonucleotides containing nucleophiles other than OH groups at the 5\xe2\x80\x98-end were studied as substrates for the topoisomerase I-mediated ligation reaction. Toward this end, oligonucleotides containing 5\xe2\x80\x98-thio, amino, and hydroxymethylene moieties were synthesized. Initial investigations utilizing a coupled cleavage\xe2\x88\x92ligation assay suggested that only the modified acceptor containing an additional methylene group underwent efficient enzyme-mediated ligation. However, as linear DNA is not a preferred substrate for topoisomerase I, the enzyme\xe2\x88\x92DNA intermediate was purified to homogeneity, thereby allowing investigation of the ligation reaction independent of the forward reaction that formed the covalent binary complex. The isolated complex consisted of equimolar enzyme and DNA, with topoisomerase I covalently bound to a specific site on the DNA duplex in an enzymatically competent form. Displacement of the enzyme-linked tyrosine moiety of the enzyme\xe2\x88\x92DNA binary complex was effected by all the modified acceptor oligonucleotides, affording unnatural internucleosidic linkages at a specific site. Characterization of the formed linkages was effected both by enzymatic and chemical degradation studies. Comparative analysis revealed overall differences in the efficiency and rate of the topoisomerase I-mediated ligation of the modified acceptors. Moreover, the facility of ligation of the amino acceptor was significantly enhanced at increasing pH values. In addition, the method utilized to obtain the topoisomerase I\xe2\x88\x92DNA intermediate is capable of affording large quantities required for further mechanistic and physicochemical characterization of the formed binary complex.

"The chemical reactivity of ribonucleotide analog 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxy-2\xe2\x80\x98-thiouridine 3\xe2\x80\x98-(p-nitrophenyl phosphate) (1), in which the 2\xe2\x80\x98 hydroxyl is replaced with a 2\xe2\x80\x98-thiol group, has been characterized. The major reaction pathway for 1, as monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy, is transphosphorylation to afford 2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-cyclic phosphorothioate 3, followed by hydrolysis of 3 to produce 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxy-2\xe2\x80\x98-thiouridine 2\xe2\x80\x98-phosphorothioate (4). Thus, the reaction pathway of 1 is similar to that of the hydrolysis of ribonucleotides, yet there are significant differences. The pH\xe2\x88\x92rate profile for transphosphorylation of 1 was determined by monitoring the formation of p-nitrophenol or p-nitrophenolate by UV\xe2\x88\x92visible spectroscopy. Analysis of the profile reveals the attacking nucleophile to be thiolate, and the pKa of the 2\xe2\x80\x98-thiol was determined to be 8.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1. At pH 7.4, the thiol-containing ribonucleotide analog 1 is hydrolyzed at an observed rate 27-fold slower than its 2\xe2\x80\x98-hydroxyl counterpart. These results indicate that the rate of thiolate attack on the adjacent phosphodiester bond is 107-fold slower than that of the corresponding alkoxide. Thiolate nucleophiles, therefore, are remarkably reticent toward attack at electrophilic phosphate centers. In addition to providing new information about the reactivity of phosphodiester bonds, our studies highlight the potential of 2\xe2\x80\x98-thiol-containing nucleotides for the study of an array of RNA processes, especially those in which the 2\xe2\x80\x98-substituent plays a critical role.

"Reactive immunization was used to generate catalytic antibodies that use the enamine mechanism common to the natural class I aldolase enzymes. In order to investigate the possibility of exploiting the imine and enamine intermediates programmed into antibody catalysts by reactive immunization and the features which antibody aldolases share with naturally evolved catalysts, we have studied their ability to catalyze the decarboxylation of structurally related \xce\xb2-keto acids. Both aldolase antibodies were shown to efficiently catalyze the decarboxylation of two hapten-related \xce\xb2-keto acids with rate enhancements (kcat/kuncat) between 4959 and 14\xe2\x80\x89774. Inhibition studies support the role of an essential lysine residue in the active site of the antibodies and the formation of a cyanide accessible imine intermediate in the mechanism. Investigation of the decarboxylation reaction of 2-{3\xe2\x80\x98-(4\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-acetamidophenyl)propyl}acetoacetic acid, 4, to 6-(4\xe2\x80\x98-acetamidophenyl)-2-hexanone, 12, in the presence of 18O-labeled water by electrospray mass spectrometry revealed obligatory incorporation of 18O in the antibody-catalyzed reaction consistent with decarboxylation proceeding via an imine intermediate. These studies demonstrate that reactive immunization may be utilized to program in fine detail the mechanism of catalytic antibodies and our ability to exploit the programmed reaction coordinate for different catalytic tasks.

"The mechanism of the interaction of singlet excited dibenzoyl(methanato)boron difluoride (*DBMBF2 = *A) with olefins and substituted benzenes (SB) was investigated by the determination of effective quenching distances (Reff) from fluorescence monitors in acetonitrile as analyzed by the Smoluchowski\xe2\x88\x92Collins\xe2\x88\x92Kimball equation and by solvent effects on the dichotomy of the formation of cycloadducts and [4 + 2] dimers from 1,3-cyclohexadiene (CHD) and 1,3-cyclooctadiene (1,3-COD). The correlation of Reff with directly demonstrates that the reactants have to get closer to affect electron transfer from these substrates as the driving force become more positive and coalesce on exciplexes. Both photophysical and photochemical probes converge on the partition of encounter pairs to the SSRIP (the ket pathway which leads to radical ion reactions and nonfluorescent) and exciplexes (the kex pathway which leads to cycloadducts and fluorescent species); the former pathway was promoted by low redox energies of donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor pairs and by high solvent polarity. The reaction with 1,3-cylcohexadiene gave high quantum yields of the [4 + 2] dimers in acetonitrile and of the cycloadduct in nonpolar solvents; the latter quantum yields were correlated with the solvent polarity parameter ET(30) in a smooth distribution regardless of pure non-SB or SB solvents or mixture solvents (including benzene), in spite of the fact that the reactive intermediates in the presence of SB are *DBMBF2\xe2\x88\x92SB exciplexes. It is proposed that in the exciplex the locally excited state provides the driving force in the cycloaddition and the CT state regulates its regiospecificity. The quantum yield of the dimers from CHD was greatly enhanced, reaching their maximum at 12 mol % of p-xylene in acetonitrile; the enhancement was attenuated with the addition of toluene and benzene in that order. This shows that the p-xylene exciplex underwent extraordinary facile substitution with CHD by electron transfer in acetonitrile probably promoted by superexchange interactions. The *DBMBF2 excimer reacted with CHD and 1,3-COD to give higher yields of cycloadducts but not the dimers, which must mean that the excimer substitution with CHD proceeds to give the new exciplex but not the radical ion pair. The latter failure as well as that of the benzene exciplex was suggested to arise from the insignificant CT content of the excimer and exciplex. The frontier MO scheme was utilized to rationalize the enhanced reactivity of the exciplexes and excimer on the bases of increased electronic and orbital interactions, respectively. "
"In this paper, we present SMoG (Small Molecule Growth), a novel, straightforward method for de novo lead design and the evidence for its effectiveness. It is based on a simple model for ligand-protein interactions and a scoring that is directly related to the free energy through a knowledge-based potential. A large number of structures are examined by an efficient metropolis Monte Carlo molecular growth algorithm that generates molecules through the adjoining of functional groups directly in the binding region. Thus SMoG is a method that is able to rank a large number of potential compounds according to binding free energy in a short time. In this sense, SMoG represents a step toward an ideal computational tool for ligand design. "
"The role of quantum mechanical nuclear motions in enzymatic reactions is examined by realistic simulations that take into account the fluctuations of an entire enzyme\xe2\x88\x92substrate complex. This is done by using the quantized classical path (QCP) approach which is based on Feynman\'s path integral formulation. The calculations evaluate the quantum mechanical activation free energy and deuterium isotope effect for the proton transfer step in the catalytic reaction of carbonic anhydrase. The calculated and observed isotope effects are in very good agreement, thus demonstrating the potential of our approach in extracting mechanistic information. Furthermore, the value of the calculated quantum mechanical rate constant is in a good agreement with the corresponding observed value. This is significant since the evaluation of the ratio between the quantum mechanical rate constants of the reaction in the protein and in aqueous solution does not involve any adjustable parameter. The reliability of our calculations is based on the use of the empirical valence bond (EVB) method. This method does not try to represent the potential surfaces of the reacting atoms by a first principle approach (this is easily done by fitting the EVB surface to experimental and theoretical results) but rather evaluates the effect of moving these atoms from solution to the enzyme active site.The possible catalytic advantage of quantum mechanical nuclear motions is examined by comparing these effects in the enzyme and in a reference solution reaction. It is found that while quantum mechanical corrections to activation free energies of enzymatic reactions can be quite large they are not drastically different than the corresponding corrections in solution. Apparently the largest catalytic effects are due to reduction in the reorganization energy and \xce\x94G0 by the electrostatic effects of the preorganized environment of the protein active site. Nevertheless, small but non-negligible catalytic contributions can be associated with quantum mechanical effects. "
"The syntheses and characterization of a series of saturated ladderanes 3, oligomers of 1,3-cyclobutadiene-1,2-dicarboxylate diesters with pendant 2-naphthyl groups, are described. Absorption and fluorescence spectra provide evidence for a ground state through-space interchromophore interaction that becomes stronger with an increasing number of pendant aryl groups. A new fluorescence band (\xce\xbbmax = 303 nm) observed in the tetramer (3c) and pentamer (3d) as blue-shifted from the monomer (\xce\xbbmax = 335 nm) was assigned as emission from an imperfectly stacked chromophore array. Nonexponential fluorescence decays of all four oligomers, obtained by single photon counting, are accommodated well by conformations attained from a molecular mechanics geometry optimization. In the solid state, the monomeric precursor of the family, tricarbonyl[di-2-naphthylmethyl 1,2,3,4-\xce\xb7-1,3-cyclobutadiene-1,2-dicarboxylate]iron (2), exists as highly stable channel solvate under ambient conditions.

"Reversible protein phosphorylation, which is mediated by kinases and phosphatases, is a major control element of the cell. There is a diverse group of toxic natural products that inhibit certain phosphatases, thereby disrupting normal biochemical pathways. These toxins can be useful for dissecting the individual biochemical pathways associated with each of these enzymes. This Article describes the first total synthesis of one such toxin, the cyclic heptapeptide microcystin-LA. The synthesis features a convergent route that is amenable to analog preparation in the search for selective phosphatase inhibitors. A new route to the unusual amino acid Adda is described, which incorporates an efficient diastereoselective aspartate alkylation and diene synthesis via a Suzuki coupling reaction. This work also features an efficient preparation of an N-methylalanine containing peptide via a Horner\xe2\x88\x92Emmons condensation and several difficult amino acid coupling reactions that relied heavily on Carpino\'s remarkable HATU reagent.

"Four different kinds of C60-linked zincporphyrins have been prepared by changing systematically the linking position at meso-phenyl ring from ortho to para and their photophysical properties have been investigated. Regardless of the linkage between the two chromophores, photoinduced charge separation (CS) and subsequent charge recombination (CR) were observed in a series of zincporphyrin-C60 dyads by picosecond fluorescence lifetime measurements and time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. In THF the CS occurs from both the excited singlet state of the porphyrin and the C60 moieties, implying that the increase of the absorption cross section by both the chromophores results in the efficient formation of the ion pair (IP) state. On the other hand, in benzene the IP state generated by the photoinduced CS from the excited singlet state of the porphyrin to the C60 produces or energetically equilibrates with the locally excited singlet state of the C60. Both the CS and CR rates for the meta isomer are much slower than those for the other porphyrin-linked C60. Linkage dependence of the electron transfer (ET) rates can be explained by superexchange mechanism via spacer. These results demonstrate that C60 is a new promising building block as an acceptor in artificial photosynthetic models. "
"Conjugated diallenes undergo stereoselective [4 + 1] cycloadditions in a variety of solvents. Accelerated thermal exchange of CO in Fe(CO)5 is catalyzed by the diallene substrate, consistent with the previous kinetic analysis. The Eyring activation parameters were determined to be \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 16.2 (\xc2\xb10.7) kcal mol-1 and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9217.9 (\xc2\xb12.3) cal mol-1 K-1. The negative entropy of activation is consistent with rate determining associative coordination of diallene to form a diallene\xe2\x88\x92iron complex. The effect of coordinating solvents on this cycloaddition reaction suggests that the synthetic utility of these transformations can now be expanded to include diallenes with functional groups that may only weakly coordinate to the iron. Only one sterically demanding substituent on the diallene termini is necessary to give good \xcf\x80-facial selectivity, which also expands the synthetic utility of these transformations. "
"Investigations of the ternary systems M/Li/Al of the heavier alkaline earth metals M = Ca, Sr, Ba yielded three new intermetallic compounds which show interesting structural relationships. Ca6LixAl23-x (x \xe2\x89\x88 11, Fm3\xcc\x84m, a = 13.430(2) \xc3\x85, Z = 4) crystallizes in the Th6Mn23 structure with all sites of the majority component occupied by Li and Al. Sr9Li7+xAl36-x (x \xe2\x89\x88 10.5, P63/mmc, a = 9.638(4) \xc3\x85, c = 27.586(6) \xc3\x85, Z = 2) is a relative of the Sr3Mg13 structure, and Ba2Li3+xAl6-x (x \xe2\x89\x88 1.2, R3\xcc\x84m, a = 9.946(1) \xc3\x85, c = 26.992(3) \xc3\x85, Z = 9) is a hexagonal relative of the Th6Mn23 type. The substructures formed by Li and Al atoms are described in terms of two simple basis clusters which offer structural flexibility in their connectivity. The relative stability of the substructures has been investigated within the simple tight-binding H\xc3\xbcckel model. Calculated energy difference curves as a function of the valence electron concentration for these networks show a pronounced stability maximum in the region of 2.5\xe2\x88\x922.7 electrons per network atom. This result fits the composition of the intermetallic compounds when applying the Zintl\xe2\x88\x92Klemm concept. In addition, Mulliken population analyses of extended H\xc3\xbcckel calculations have been used to investigate the site occupancies. "
"The results of an investigation of the ultrafast dynamics of photoinduced deligation in two transition metalloporphyrin\xe2\x88\x92nitrosyl complexes, TPPFeIINO and TPPCoIINO, in conjuction with the results of an energy transfer study lead to the conclusion that the difference in the denitrosylation yields (\xcf\x86NO = 0.5 for TPPFeIINO and \xcf\x86NO = 1.0 for TPPCoIINO) is the result of energy partitioning in the upper excited states of the porphyrin. The energy transfer study yielded the energies of the metal centered states, believed to be of CT(\xcf\x80,dz2) nature, and of the localized porphyrin triplet states. The CT states in the two complexes were found to lie at similar energies (TPPFeIINO 8650 cm-1 and TPPCoIINO 8900 cm-1); however, the localized porphyrin triplet states were found to be at 16200 cm-1 in TPPFeIINO and 14700 cm-1 in TPPCoIINO. This difference in energies of the respective triplet states facilitates efficient intersystem crossing in the excited state deactivation of TPPFeIINO, but does not allow any triplet formation in TPPCoIINO. The direct excitation studies revealed that intersystem crossing in TPPFeIINO occurs with a rate constant of 7.3 \xc3\x97 1011 s-1 to yield a localized porphyrin triplet state that absorbs maximally at 450 nm. This state then relaxes back to the ground state without the loss of NO. Only those excited states that relax via the CT state result in loss of NO. The direct excitation studies yielded no evidence for intersystem crossing in the deactivation of the electronically excited singlet state of TPPCoIINO, hence all of the energy deposited in the initial photoexcitation step results in NO loss. The lifetimes and spectral characteristics of the other excited states involved in deactivation of these transition metalloporphyrin\xe2\x88\x92nitrosyl complexes will be discussed. "
"The kinetics of the reaction (\xce\xbc-H)2Ru3(CO)8(\xce\xbc-P(t-Bu)2)2 + H2 \xe2\x87\x84 (\xce\xbc-H)2Ru3(CO)8(H)2(\xce\xbc-P(t-Bu)2)2 have been studied. The reaction of (\xce\xbc-H)2Ru3(CO)8(\xce\xbc-P(t-Bu)2)2 with H2 has a rate law which is first-order in cluster concentration and in hydrogen pressure and inverse order in CO pressure; on the basis of the rate law, activation parameters, and deuterium kinetic isotope effect, hydrogen addition is proposed to involve rapid, reversible dissociation of a carbonyl ligand, followed by rate-determining oxidative addition of hydrogen through a three-center transition state at a single metal atom. Loss of hydrogen from (\xce\xbc-H)2Ru3(H)2(CO)8(\xce\xbc-P(t-Bu)2)2 also involves reversible loss of a carbonyl, followed by rate-determining reductive elimination of molecular hydrogen. The reaction is highly sensitive to the steric bulk of the phosphido substituents, as (\xce\xbc-H)2Ru3(CO)8(\xce\xbc-PR2)2, R = cyclohexyl and phenyl, do not react with hydrogen. In addition, the rate of exchange with 13CO is much faster for R = t-Bu than for R = cyclohexyl. Based upon the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant for hydrogenation, the energy for the unbridged Ru\xe2\x88\x92Ru bond of (\xce\xbc-H)2Ru3(CO)8(\xce\xbc-P(t-Bu)2)2 is estimated to be 47\xe2\x88\x9259 kJ/mol, the low value being attributed to steric strain.

"This paper reports the synthesis and structures of two key members, [(18C6)K][Cd(SCN)3] (1) and [(18C6)2Na2(H2O)2]1/2[Cd(SCN)3] (2), of a new inorganic polymers with organic spacers (IPOS) series with the general formula [H\xe2\x88\x92G][M\xe2\x88\x92L], where the organic cation [H\xe2\x88\x92G]q+ is a host (H)\xe2\x88\x92guest (G) complex such as [(crown ether)\xe2\x88\x92(alkali metal)]+ and the inorganic anion [M\xe2\x88\x92L]q- is a metal (M)\xe2\x88\x92ligand (L) coordination polymer such as [Cd(SCN)3-]\xe2\x88\x9e. 1 and 2 were prepared from 18C6, MSCN, and CdSO4 where M = K+ (for 1) and Na+ (for 2), respectively. 1 crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell of Cmc21 space group symmetry with lattice parameters a = 14.734(3) \xc3\x85, b = 15.304(2) \xc3\x85, c = 10.625(3) \xc3\x85; V = 2396(1) \xc3\x853, and Z = 4.

The structure was refined to R1 = 3.7% for 2415 independent reflections (2\xce\xb8 \xe2\x89\xa4 46\xc2\xb0) with I > 3\xcf\x83. These crystals exhibit interesting physical properties such as nonlinear optical effects (NLO). The novel features of this particular IPOS series, as exemplified by the title compounds, as tailorable crystalline materials are (1) the anions form isolated polymeric one-dimensional zig-zag chains of [Cd(SCN)3-]\xe2\x88\x9e with extended \xcf\x80-conjugation system within the polymeric \xe2\x88\x92[MSC\xe2\x8b\xaeN]M\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7 chain and high polarizabilities (which are important for NLO effects); and (2) the cationic host\xe2\x88\x92guest complex [(18C6)M]+ serves as a spacer/controller of the crystal structure and crystal symmetry. The most important characteristic of the IPOS system reported herein is that it allows concomitant but separate molecular and crystal engineering (i.e., design of molecular structures and crystal packings in two independent controls). A detailed analysis of the structures of 1 and 2 revealed parallel and antiparallel arrangements, respectively, of the infinite anionic [Cd(SCN)3-]\xe2\x88\x9e polymeric zig-zag chains; such arrangements are presumably dictated by the monomeric and dimeric host\xe2\x88\x92guest [(18C6)M]+ cations. General design strategies, in terms of symmetry control, as well as molecular and crystal engineering, in terms of electronic and stereochemical controls, are discussed. Furthermore, the structures of the title crystals may be considered as \xe2\x80\x9ccrystal host\xe2\x88\x92guest clathrates\xe2\x80\x9d in which the infinite anionic polymeric [Cd(SCN)3-]\xe2\x88\x9e chains form an approximate square motif, creating square channels which are filled by \xe2\x80\x9cmolecular host\xe2\x88\x92guest complexes\xe2\x80\x9d such as [(18C6)K]+ (in 1) or [(18C6)2Na2(H2O)2]2+ (in 2).

"This paper is devoted to the determination of the spin density in the S = 2 ground state of [Mn(Me6-[14]ane-N4)Cu(oxpn)](CF3SO3)2 with Me6-[14]ane-N4 = (\xc2\xb1)-5,7,7,12,14,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane and oxpn = N,N\xe2\x80\x98-bis(3-aminopropyl)oxamido. The crystal structure, previously determined at room temperature through X-ray diffraction and at 40 K through unpolarized neutron diffraction, consists of oxamido-bridged [Mn(Me6-[14]ane-N4)Cu(oxpn)]2+ cations and non-coordinated triflate anions. Within the cation the SMn = 5/2 and SCu = 1/2 local ground states are antiferromagnetically coupled, which gives rise to a ground S = 2 and an excited S = 3 pair states, with a quintet\xe2\x88\x92septet energy gap of \xe2\x88\x9293.3 cm-1. The experimental spin density has been deduced from polarized neutron diffraction data recorded at 2 K under 50 kOe. Positive spin populations were observed on the manganese side, and negative spin populations on the copper side. The delocalization of the spin density from the metal center toward the terminal and bridging ligands was found to be more pronounced on the copper side than on the manganese side, and the nodal surface (of zero spin density) is closer to the manganese than to the copper atom. The experimental data have been compared to the results of several theoretical approaches, corresponding to different levels of sophistication. These approaches are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) the pure Heitler\xe2\x88\x92London description of the S = 2 ground state; (ii) the incorporation of the spin delocalization in the Heitler\xe2\x88\x92London scheme, using the concept of magnetic orbitals in the extended H\xc3\xbcckel formalism; and (iii) two types of density functional theory methods. In cases ii and iii, the experimental spin populations have been fairly well reproduced. The DFT approaches have provided some important insights on both spin-delocalization and spin-polarization effects. "
"The reaction of Pt(PiPr3)3 with SO2 led to the formation of (PiPr3)2Pt(SO2) (1), isolated in 93% yield. The addition of [H(OEt2)2]+BArf (BArf = B(3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)4) to 1 in ether at \xe2\x88\x9278 \xc2\xb0C afforded the solvent complex trans-[(PiPr3)2Pt(H)(OEt2)]BArf (2) in 85% isolated yield. Complex 2 served as a precursor to monodentate halocarbon complexes of the type Pt(\xce\xb71-XR). The dichloromethane complex trans-[(PiPr3)2Pt(H)(\xce\xb71-ClCH2Cl)]BArf (3) was isolated in 80% yield by the recrystallization of 2 from CH2Cl2/hexane. IR spectroscopy suggested the existence of dichloromethane binding which was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The reaction of 2 or 3 with iodo- or bromobenzene led to the isolation of the haloarene complexes trans-[(PiPr3)2Pt(H)(\xce\xb71-XPh)]BArf, where X = I (4, 87% yield) or Br (5, 60% yield). Both compounds were characterized spectroscopically and by X-ray crystallography. An unexpected steric interaction in 4, suggested by molecular mechanics calculations to be significant, was rationalized in terms of halide-to-metal \xcf\x80 bonding. The PhI complex 4 decomposed under harsh conditions to the bridging iodide compound {trans-[(PiPr3)2Pt(H)]2(\xce\xbc-I)}BArf (6) which was structurally characterized. The THF adduct [(PiPr3)2Pt(H)(THF)]BArf (7), isolated in 78% yield and also characterized by X-ray crystallography, was formed when any of the compounds 2, 3, 4, or 5 was dissolved in THF. The CH2Cl2 complex 3 reacted with H2 to form the dihydrogen complex trans-[(PiPr3)2Pt(H)(\xce\xb72-H2)]BArf which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy. "
"The influence of tertiary phosphines on the stability of FeS3P coordination units and the formation of iron\xe2\x88\x92sulfur clusters has been investigated. Reaction of [Fe4S4Cl4]2- with a small excess of PR3 in acetonitrile/THF affords the cubane-type clusters [Fe4S4(PR3)4]1+ (R = Cy, But, Pri), one-electron reduced over the initial cluster and possessing an S = 1/2 ground state. These clusters may be electrochemically oxidized to [Fe4S4(PR3)4]2+ and reduced to [Fe4S4(PR3)4], which can also be generated in solution by chemical reduction. The neutral clusters upon standing in solution lose phosphine and aggregate to form dicubane ([Fe8S8(PCy3)6]) or tetracubane ([Fe16S16(PR3)8]; R = But, Pri) clusters. The [Fe8S8]0 dicubane core has two intercubane Fe\xe2\x88\x92S bonds, defining an Fe2S2 rhomb and affording a structure of overall idealized C2h symmetry. The tetracubane clusters consist of a cyclic array of four cubanes joined in four Fe2S2 rhombs in a structure of overall D4 symmetry, and present a new structural motif in Fe\xe2\x88\x92S cluster chemistry. Tertiary phosphines impose two significant features on this cluster chemistry. These ligands significantly stabilize the [Fe4S4]1+/0 core oxidation levels compared to the case of conventional [Fe4S4L4]3-,4- clusters (L = monoanion). Ligands with cone angles exceeding that of PEt3 (132\xc2\xb0) favor tetrahedral FeS3P coordination sites. This has the effect of directing reactions away from the formation of Fe6S6 (four trigonal pyramidal) and Fe6S8 (six square pyramidal) clusters having the indicated sites which are disfavored by large cone angles. Structural principles governing polycubane clusters together with a brief enumeration of stereochemically feasible polycubanes are presented and discussed. "
"A new class of porphyrins in which intervening ethynyl moieties connect aryl groups to the porphyrin 5- and 15-positions is described. The synthesis and optical spectroscopy of five new compounds are reported:\xe2\x80\x89 [5,15-bis[(4\xe2\x80\x98-dimethylaminophenyl)ethynyl]-10,20-diphenylporphinato]zinc(II), [5,15-bis[(4\xe2\x80\x98-methoxyphenyl)ethynyl]-10,20-diphenylporphinato]zinc(II), [5,15-bis[(phenyl)ethynyl]-10,20-diphenylporphinato]zinc(II), [5,15-bis[(4\xe2\x80\x98-fluorophenyl)ethynyl]-10,20-diphenylporphinato]zinc(II), and [5,15-bis[(4\xe2\x80\x98-nitrophenyl)ethynyl]-10,20-diphenylporphinato]zinc(II). The X-ray structure of one of these complexes, [5,15-bis[(4\xe2\x80\x98-fluorophenyl)ethynyl]-10,20-diphenylporphinato]zinc(II), is unusual in that it shows the arylethynyl-phenyl rings to be coplanar with the porphyrin macrocycle. This arrangement of aryl rings with respect to the porphyrin macrocycle underscores the fact that the steric barrier to rotation between the porphyrin and arylethynyl-phenyl aromatic systems has been removed and highlights the enhanced \xcf\x80-conjugative interactions responsible for the unusual electronic characteristics of these molecules. Electronic spectroscopy and electrochemistry of these systems evince the ability of this new porphyrin structural motif to modulate extensively chromophore electronic structure. ZINDO-determined (INDO-1 semiempirical parameters; CI level = 20) frontier orbital energies for the [5,15-bis[(aryl)ethynyl]-10,20-diphenylporphinato]zinc(II) complexes demonstrate that these properties derive from energetic differences between the porphyrin HOMO and HOMO-1 and a substantial splitting of the formerly degenerate porphyrin LUMO; these significant electronic perturbations (relative to simple (porphinato)zinc(II) complexes) are manifest in the fact that the low lying singlet excited states of these compounds are highly polarized.

"The isomeric m- and p-benzyne anions have been generated in the gas phase in a flowing afterglow-triple quadrupole instrument from the reactions of molecular fluorine (F2) with m- and p-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl anions. The mechanism of the F2 reaction involves electron transfer from the (trimethylsilyl)phenyl anion to F2, followed by nucleophilic attack on the resulting (trimethylsilyl)phenyl radical by the nascent F- formed within the intermediate ion/molecule complex. The structures of o-, m-, and p-benzyne anion are unambiguously identified by a classical derivatization scheme wherein the ions are first converted to the corresponding o-, m-, and p-nitrobenzoates by stepwise addition of CO2 and NO2. These derivatives are then identified by forming proton-bound dimers of each ion with CHF2CO2H, and comparing the O2NC6H4CO2-/CHF2CO2- yield ratios obtained by collision-induced dissociation (CID) with those obtained from analogous experiments with the authentic nitrobenzoate ions. Estimates of the electron affinities of m- and p-benzyne have been determined by the kinetic method. Adducts of SO2 with phenide ion and each of the isomeric benzyne anions are formed that produce measurable yields of SO2\xe2\x80\xa2- and the corresponding C6Hn- ion upon CID. A calibration relation is derived between the CID yield ratios obtained for the C6H5SO2- and o-C6H4SO2\xe2\x80\xa2- adducts and the known electron affinities of phenyl radical (25.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1 kcal/mol) and o-benzyne (12.9 \xc2\xb1 0.2 kcal/mol). The measured CID ratios for the m- and p-benzyne SO2 adducts are then combined with this relation to obtain EA(m-benzyne) = 19.5 \xc2\xb1 0.3 kcal/mol and EA(p-benzyne) = 28.8 \xc2\xb1 0.5 kcal/mol. These data are used to derive the following gas-phase acidities for the different ring positions of phenyl radical and the corresponding C\xe2\x88\x92H bond strengths for the phenide ion (\xce\x94Hacid(C6H5), DH298[C6H4-\xe2\x88\x92H], kcal/mol):\xe2\x80\x89 ortho 378.2 \xc2\xb1 3.1, 93.7 \xc2\xb1 3.1; meta 386.9 \xc2\xb1 3.1, 102.4 \xc2\xb1 3.1; para 393.5 \xc2\xb1 2.9, 109.0 \xc2\xb1 2.9.

"A general theoretical description of \xe2\x80\x9cdistonic\xe2\x80\x9d radical anions is presented, along with an account of an extensive series of ab initio molecular orbital and density functional theory calculations on the negative ions of o-, m- and p-benzyne. The performance of several different computational methods is evaluated with respect to artifactual symmetry-breaking. QCISD(T), CCSD(T), CASPT2N, and DFT(B3LYP) calculations employing double-\xce\xb6 quality basis sets predict that o-, m-, and p-benzyne anions all have high-symmetry, delocalized radical anion ground electronic states:\xe2\x80\x89 2B2 (C2v), 2B2 (C2v), and 2Ag (D2h), respectively. The meta and para isomers also exhibit low-lying, localized radical anion forms with distorted geometries that arise by pseudo Jahn-Teller interactions (vibronic coupling):\xe2\x80\x89 2A\xe2\x80\x98 (Cs) for m-benzyne anion and 2A1 (C2v) for p-benzyne anion. Broken-symmetry wave functions are obtained at symmetrical geometries from MCSCF and CISD calculations for p-benzyne anion, but not for o- and m-benzyne anions. The calculated potential energy surfaces for in-plane distortion of m- and p-benzyne anions are found to be quite flat. An isodesmic reaction approach is used to calculate the electron, proton, and hydrogen atom-binding energies for each of the minimum energy states. Good agreement is achieved between the experimental estimates for these quantities and the calculated values for the lowest-energy anion states. The implications of the theoretical findings for negative ion photoelectron spectroscopic measurements with the m- and p-benzyne anions are discussed. "
"The alkali metal ion (M+ = Li+, Na+, K+) affinities of the common DNA and RNA nucleobases are determined in the gas phase by investigating the dissociation of metal ion-bound heterodimers [nucleobase + B]M+, in which B represents a reference base of known affinity (kinetic method). The dimer ion decompositions are assessed at two different internal energies, namely from metastable precursor ions and after collisional activation. This approach makes it possible to deconvolute entropy from enthalpy and, therefore, leads to more accurate affinity (i.e. enthalpy or bond energy) values. For the nucleobases studied, viz. guanine, cytosine, adenine, thymine, and uracil, the corresponding M+\xe2\x88\x92nucleobase bond energies are (kJ mol-1) as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 239, 232, 226, 215, and 211 with Li+; 182, 177, 172, 144, and 141 with Na+; and 117, 110, 106, 102, and 101 with K+. The method used also provides quantitative information about the overall entropy change occurring upon the dissociation of the heterodimers; this change is most significant when dissociation alters rotational degrees of freedom. The magnitude of the operating entropy effects gives information on the structures of both the metal ion-bound dimers and the metalated nucleobase monomers. It is found that Li+, Na+, and K+ bind very similarly to the nucleobases. Attachment sites that explain the observed entropic effects and metal ion affinity orders are suggested and discussed. A notable characteristic of several of the resulting structures is their ability to form stabilizing ion pairs (salt bridges). "
"The reactivity of the prototypical phosphorus-containing ylidion (\xce\xb1-distonic ion) \xe2\x80\xa2CH2PH3+ has been investigated in the gas phase by using a dual cell Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. The ion \xe2\x80\xa2CH2PH3+ and its more stable conventional isomer CH3PH2\xe2\x80\xa2+ show distinctly different reactivities toward neutral reagents. This observation contrasts the facile interconversion of the analogous sulfur- and oxygen-containing distonic ions \xe2\x80\xa2CH2SH2+ and \xe2\x80\xa2CH2OH2+ with their conventional isomers CH3OH\xe2\x80\xa2+ and CH3SH\xe2\x80\xa2+, respectively, within collision complexes in the gas phase. Bracketing experiments yield a proton affinity of 190.4 \xc2\xb1 3 kcal mol-1 for the phosphorus atom in \xe2\x80\xa2CH2PH2. Together with a calculated heat of formation for \xe2\x80\xa2CH2PH2, this value yields a heat of formation of 217 \xc2\xb1 3 kcal mol-1 (at 298 K) for the distonic ion \xe2\x80\xa2CH2PH3+. "
"Azacyclohexatriene-2-ylidene (1), the 2-isomer of pyridine (2), has been generated by one-electron reduction of the corresponding radical cation in neutralization\xe2\x88\x92reionization mass spectrometric experiments. The experimental finding that this molecule is stable on the microsecond time scale is in agreement with results of quantum chemical calculations that indicate both 1 and its radical cation, 1\xe2\x80\xa2+, correspond to minima on the C5H5N and C5H5N\xe2\x80\xa2+ potential energy surfaces. The calculations predict that 1 is less stable than pyridine, 2, by 50 and 49 kcal/mol (MP2/6-31G** and CASSCF-MP2/6-31G**, respectively) or 47 kcal/mol (B3LYP/6-31G**), whereas the radical cations 1\xe2\x80\xa2+ and 2\xe2\x80\xa2+ are much closer in energy. The ylid ion 1\xe2\x80\xa2+ is predicted to be 6 and 7 kcal/mol lower in energy than 2\xe2\x80\xa2+ at the MP2 and CASSCF-MP2/6-31G** levels, respectively, and 1 kcal/mol higher according to the hybrid density functional theory. Calculations also suggest that facile isomerization of the ions is prohibited by an energy barrier, amounting to 62 and 57 kcal/mol at MP2/6-31G** and B3LYP/6-31G**, respectively, relative to 1\xe2\x80\xa2+, which is even larger than the 38 kcal/mol obtained at both levels of theory required for the neutral transformation. Despite the substantial impediments, isomerization of excited species is possible since the lowest dissociation channels lie even higher in energy but the experimental observations confirm that neither the ions or neutrals undergo particularly facile isomerization. Using known thermochemical data a value for \xce\x94Hf (1\xe2\x80\xa2+) = 237 \xc2\xb1 5 kcal/mol was obtained from the measured appearance energy, 10.14 eV, of the C5H5N\xe2\x80\xa2+ ion generated from methyl picolinate, which is completely consistent with the theoretical predictions of 237\xe2\x88\x92242 kcal/mol derived from the calculated energy differences between the various species and the known heat of formation of 2.

"The threshold fragmentation energies (Eo) of three different 4-(1\xe2\x80\x98-substituted-2\xe2\x80\x98-phenethyl)-1-methylpyridinium salts containing a neutral, an electron-donor, or an electron-acceptor group as \xce\xb1-substituent, respectively, were measured by Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FTICR/MS) collisionally activated dissociation (CAD). N-Methyl-4-(1-ethoxy-2-phenylethyl)pyridinium iodide (10), containing both electron-donor and electron-acceptor substituent groups, has a significantly lower Eo than the analogs containing a benzyl (6) or benzoyl (7) substituent. This was ascribed to merostabilization of the corresponding radical 19, and this conclusion was further supported by theoretical calculations. "
"We report the synthesis and characterization of self-assembled polydiacetylene (PDA)/4-tert-butylcalix[n]arene (where n = 4 and 6, abbreviated as CA[4] and CA[6], respectively) bilayers on Au surfaces. The PDA/CA[n] bilayers act as chemically sensitive interfaces that are resistant to high thermal stresses and extreme electrochemical potentials, both of which may be encountered in technologically significant sensing applications. Moreover, these simply prepared bilayer materials are excellent protosystems for studying a range of important sensor-related issues. Here we discuss the linking chemistry that leads to calixarene immobilization and examine the role calixarenes play in vapor-phase sensing applications using surface acoustic wave (SAW) mass balances and Fourier transform infrared\xe2\x88\x92external reflectance spectroscopy (FTIR-ERS). FTIR-ERS spectra indicate that CA[n] reacts with the acid chloride-terminated PDA self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to form ester linkages. Using irreversible adsorption of vapor-phase n-butylamine onto the CA[n] bilayer-coated SAW devices as an indirect nanogravimetric probe of surface coverage, we calculate that CA[4] and CA[6] cover 58% and 61%, respectively, of the PDA surface. The irreversibly bound n-butylamine serves a secondary purpose by effectively filling voids between calixarenes, which hinders access to them by the vapor-phase molecules. Dosing the bilayer-coated SAW devices with VOCs after exposure to n-butylamine permits a better understanding of the role of the calixarene cavities relative to nonspecific adsorption at, for example, defect sites between CA[n] molecules. Additional control experiments involving PDA/CA[n] analogs, such as phenyl-terminated PDA, show that VOC adsorption is enhanced only on the CA[n] surfaces. This strongly suggests the presence of a specific interaction between the CA[n] cavities and VOCs rather than simple nonspecific adsorption. "
"The solvation of halogen ions (F-, Cl-) in liquid SO2 was investigated by means of ab initio calculations. Discrete complexes of one to four SO2 ligands with a halide ion were optimized at various levels of theory. In the cases of the SO2 molecule and the primarily formed halosulfite ions, the influence of the level of electron correlation and different basis sets on the structures and energies was studied by calculations at various levels of theory up to QCISD(T). The stabilities of the halosulfite ions were found to be \xe2\x88\x9246.9 kcal/mol for the fluorosulfite ion (1) and \xe2\x88\x9219.8 kcal/mol for the chlorosulfite ion (2). Higher complexes were optimized at the HF/6-31+G* and MP2/6-31+G* levels, and two different complexation patterns were obtained:\xe2\x80\x89 complexation at the halogen or at an oxygen of the halosulfite ion. Almost independently of the type of complexation, each SO2 ligand afforded a stabilization energy of 10\xe2\x88\x9218 kcal/mol, thus proving that the high solvation energy is responsible for the ionogenic character of this solvent. The bonding situation in the complexes was studied by NBO analyses, and it was found that the stabilization is mainly due to electrostatic interactions, while charge transfer, covalent bonding, and orbital interactions make only minor contributions.

"Difference infrared spectroscopy is used to study the manganese-containing catalytic site of photosystem II. Vibrational spectroscopy can test the hypothesis that there are protein conformational differences between the two EPR detectable forms of the S2 state, which are known as the g = 4.1 and the multiline state. A light-minus-dark difference spectrum is constructed at 200, 130, and 80 K. These illumination temperatures generate the S2 multiline state, the S2 g = 4.1 state, and a chlorophyll cation radical, respectively. Our data show that a unique protein conformation is associated with the formation of the g = 4.1 S2 state. Also, difference infrared spectroscopy demonstrates that formation of the S2 multiline state perturbs the vibrational spectrum of one or more carboxylic acid residues that may be in the vicinity of the manganese cluster. The perturbation is probably due to a change in hydrogen bonding or effective dielectric constant upon formation of the S2 state. Further, this carboxylate residue is conserved in plant and in cyanobacterial photosystem II. "
"The Br\xc3\xb8nsted acidity of HCl in neutral buffered AlCl3:1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (EMIC) melts has been compared to the Br\xc3\xb8nsted acidity of HCl in acidic (55 mol % AlCl3) melts. The acidities were compared using the spectrophotometric indicator method. Arenes were used as the weak indicator bases. The acidity of HCl in the neutral buffered melts was found to be dependent on both the type of buffering agent (LiCl, KCl, and NaCl) and on the concentration of the metal cation in the melt. An enhancement in Br\xc3\xb8nsted acidity of HCl is observed in the neutral buffered melts, although to a lesser degree than that in the acidic melts. A Hammett acidity function was determined for a NaCl (originally 55 mol % AlCl3) buffered melt and a LiCl (originally 55 mol % AlCl3) buffered melt. For a HCl (1 atm)/NaCl/AlCl3:EMIC (originally 55 mol % AlCl3) buffered melt, Ho = \xe2\x88\x9211.3. Ho = \xe2\x88\x9212.7 for a HCl (1 atm)/LiCl/AlCl3:EMIC (originally 55 mol % AlCl3) buffered melt.

"The preference of XeF6 for either a trigonally distorted or a regular octahedral structure is determined by a delicate balance of several competing factors. A regular octahedron is favored (a) by electron correlation and (b) by the relativistic contraction of the Xe 5s orbital. In contrast, higher angular momentum (in particular f-type) basis functions on Xe favor a distortion. While earlier SCF or other nonrelativistic calculations were in apparent agreement with experimental evidence for a distorted structure, this has been due to a partial cancellation of errors. The present study contains all-electron calculations as well as calculations of the valence-electrons in an effective core potential. For the former, electron correlation has been included at the MP2 level and relativistic effects by means of direct perturbation theory, for the latter the highest level was CCSD(T) for the treatment of electron correlation, and relativistic effects were simulated by means of a quasirelativistic effective core potential. Both sets of calculations lead to consistent results. These indicate that the \xe2\x80\x9cXeF6-like\xe2\x80\x9d XF6 compounds with light central atoms or ions like ClF6- or BrF6- prefer the structure of a regular octahedron. The same is true for KrF6, which is not stable with respect to Kr + 3F2 but probably represents a local minimum. For these light central atoms, electron correlation is decisive for a regular structure, while at Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock level, i.e., ignoring correlation effects, the structure of lowest energy is distorted. Regular octahedra are also predicted for systems with very heavy central atoms like RnF6, AtF6-, and PoF62-. For these compounds relativistic effects (supported by electron correlation) stabilize the regular octahedron. The situation is more complicated for XeF6, IF6-, and TeF62-. Here the strong distortion found at nonrelativistic SCF level is compensated partly, but apparently not completely, by electron correlation and relativistic effects. This results in distorted, fluctuating structures with only little stabilization compared to the regular octahedron. A similar situation holds for SeF62-. None of the available simple models of main-group structural chemistry is able to predict or rationalize all of these structures. One inevitably has to use more subtle descriptions. "
A general method to predict and interpret the transfer mechanisms of ionizable compounds at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) is presented. The approach is based on the construction of the ionic partition diagram of the solute. It consists in defining equiconcentration boundaries as a function of the Galvani potential difference and aqueous pH by taking into account the thermodynamic equilibria governing the distribution of the various acid/base forms of the molecules involved. The method defines the domains of predominance of each species either in the aqueous or in the organic phase. The application of ionic partition diagrams to quinidine offers a global and direct visualization of all the species and demonstrates the validity and efficiency of the method in helping to understand the transfer and partition mechanisms of ionizable drugs. 
"The design, synthesis, and analysis of analogs of d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 possessing one or two intrahelical disulfide cross-links is reported. The cross-linked oligomers were prepared by first synthesizing duplexes where the 3\xe2\x80\x98- and 5\xe2\x80\x98-terminal bases of the parent sequence were replaced with N3-thioethylthymidine. Following deprotection and purification, air oxidation afforded the desired cross-linked constructs in high yield. Analysis of both the oxidized (disulfide cross-linked) and reduced (thiol modified) duplexes by UV, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopies along with susceptibility to EcoRI cleavage indicates that the modifications are not structurally perturbing. Optical thermal denaturation and differential scanning calorimetry measurements suggest that introducing disulfide cross-link(s) into d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 does, however, cause two fundamental changes. First, the cross-link(s) increase the thermal stability of the modified duplexes by changing the molecularity of denaturation without an increase in enthalpy. Second, the disulfide cross-link traps one of the conformations of the conformationally heterogeneous parent molecule resulting in a conformationally homogeneous system. Both of these features are themselves unique and will be important for further applications of disulfide cross-linked oligomers such as these in studies of nucleic acid structure and function. "
"Site-specific recombinases and topoisomerases break and rejoin the phosphodiester bonds of DNA. Both classes of enzymes do so through the formation of a covalent intermediate involving a phosphodiester bond with a hydroxylated amino acid (usually tyrosine). We have previously shown that oligonucleotides that bear a 3\xe2\x80\x98-phosphoryltyrosine residue linked to the phosphoryl group via a phenolic hydroxyl group are effective substrates for the assay of ligation by the FLP recombinase and mammalian topoisomerase I. In this article we describe the synthesis of oligonucleotides bearing several novel 3\xe2\x80\x98-phosphoryl substituents. It is shown that oligonucleotides bearing a 3\xe2\x80\x98-phosphoryltyrosine residue N-substituted on tyrosine with the bulky fluorescent groups dansyl and pyrene are ligated effectively by the FLP recombinase, and the dansyltyrosine derivative is used as effectively as the tyrosine adduct by mammalian topoisomerase I. The dansyl derivatives were completely stable during the syntheses; this underlines the potential usefulness of the dansylated class of compounds for the development of simplified assays and for mechanistic studies of breaking\xe2\x88\x92joining enzymes.

"We have developed a synthetic approach to the self-assembly of [2]-, [3]-, and [4]rotaxanes, incorporating bis-p-phenylene-34-crown-10 as the ring component(s) surrounding bipyridinium-based dumbbell-shaped components bearing dendritic stoppers at both ends. As a result of the hydrophobic dendritic framework, these [n]rotaxanes are soluble in a wide range of organic solvents, despite the polycationic natures of their bipyridinium-based backbones. In all cases, they could be purified by means of column chromatography employing relatively low polar eluants. The molecular shuttling action of the [2]rotaxane containing two bipyridinium units on the rod portion of the dumbbell-shaped component has been investigated by variable-temperature 1H-NMR spectroscopy in a range of solvents [CDCl3, CD2Cl2, THF-d8, and (CD3)2CO] for the first time. This investigation reveals a marked dependence of the rate of the shuttling process upon the polarity of the media. On going from CDCl3 to (CD3)2CO, the rate constant increases from ca. 200 to 33000 times per second. Molecular dynamics simulations, performed in CHCl3 and Me2CO on the [2]rotaxane, suggest that significant conformational changes occur upon changing the polarity of the medium resulting in both steric and electronic hindrance of the shuttling process in CHCl3. Three-dimensional representations, as well as the approximate sizesi.e. overall lengths and molecular volumes which range from 3 to 6 nm and from 4 to 6 nm3, respectivelyof these molecular compounds, were obtained by means of molecular modeling studies. Thus, these nanometer-scale dendritic rotaxanes resemble naturally-occurring chemical systems incorporating an active component, in so far as the rotaxane-like core with its distinctive recognition features is surrounded by a molecular shell in the form of the dendritic framework.

"Optically active (98% ee) (R)-1,1,3,4,4,5,5,5-octadeutero-1-pentene (1) was prepared and used to evaluate the stereoselectivity of Y-H and Y-n-pentyl additions for the optically pure C2-symmetric (R,S)-(BnBp)Y-R/(S,R)-(BnBp)Y-R and racemic (\xc2\xb1)-(BnBp)Y-R isospecific polypropylene catalysts (BnBp = {(OC10H6C10H6O)Si(C5H2-2-SiMe3-4-CMe3)2}). Deuteration and deuterodimerization of 1 mediated by (R,S)-, (S,R)-, and (\xc2\xb1)-(BnBp)Y-D provide alkanes whose 1H NMR spectra indicate the sense and magnitude of olefin facial selectivity for insertions into metal\xe2\x88\x92hydride and metal\xe2\x88\x92n-pentyl bonds. It is shown that useful information concerning the stereochemistry of olefin insertion can be deduced from the 2H NMR spectra of 1-pentene deuterodimers without the requirement of a stereochemically labeled pentene or a resolved catalyst.

"The crystal structures of a family of six secondary arenedicarboxamides have been determined. Four rodlike arenedicarboxamides pack in one-dimensional tapes in which the hydrogen-bonded scaffold holds adjacent arenes at a fixed separation of 5 \xc3\x85. The dihedral angles between the planes of adjacent arenes range from 0\xc2\xb0 (face-to-face) to 68\xc2\xb0 (edge-to-face). Two naphthalenedicarboxamides pack in two-dimensional sheets. The 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxamide packs in a highly puckered single-layer sheet with no arene\xe2\x88\x92arene close contacts. The 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxamide packs in an unusual bilayer sheet with partial face-to-face overlap of naphthalenes from adjacent sheets. Force field calculations indicate that electrostatic interactions are dominated by hydrogen bonding within a single tape or sheet and that the energetics of crystal packing in tapes or sheets are very similar. Thus, the nonbonded interactions between neighboring tapes or sheets play an important role in the determination of the packing motif. In the case of the tape structures, adjacent tapes have close-packed edge-to-face or herringbone arene\xe2\x88\x92arene interactions, whereas the sheet structures display \xcf\x80-stacking and CO\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7HC hydrogen bonding.

"A study of the effect of a helix dipole on the pKa of a side chain functional group has been undertaken to determine the magnitude of these electrostatic effects in the absence of interfering influences from a protein matrix. Three helical peptides were prepared:\xe2\x80\x89 two containing Asp residues at the N- or C-terminus and one with an Asp residue in the middle of the peptide. These peptides have no reactive residues other than the Asp side chain carboxylate group. Circular dichroism confirmed that these peptides adopt helical conformations in aqueous solution over a broad pH range. The pKa of compound 12, where the Asp residue is at the N-terminus of the helix, is 3.81 \xc2\xb1 0.31. This is lower than the pKa of an Asp residue in a short nonhelical model compound (4.09 \xc2\xb1 0.21) and lower than the pKa values of 23, where the Asp residue is at the C-terminus of a helix (4.17 \xc2\xb1 0.24), and 19, where the Asp residue is in the middle of the helix (4.17 \xc2\xb1 0.29). No significant perturbation was observed at the C-terminus of a helix (compound 23), despite this being the negative pole of the dipole. We believe that this carboxylate is drawn toward the N-terminus by electrostatic attraction to the positive pole of the dipole, resulting in positioning of the carboxylate over the middle of the helix rather than over the C-terminus.

"1,2- and 1,4-dihydropyridines react with alkoxycarbene complexes of chromium and tungsten to give, upon an unprecedented hydride transfer, alcohol elimination, and pyridine fixation on the carbene carbon, a new class of air-stable pyridinium ylide complexes. These pyridine-protected alkylidene complexes of chromium(0) and tungsten(0) were fully characterized by X-ray crystallography. In the case of (CO)5WC(CH3)(OEt) (5a), besides the pyridinium ylide complex (CO)5W-\xe2\x88\x92C(H)(CH3)(pyridine)+ (7a), the dihydropyridinium complex (CO)5W-\xe2\x88\x92C(H)(CH3)(2,5-dihydropyridine)+ (8a) was also isolated. The intermediate tungstate (CO)5W-\xe2\x88\x92C(H)(CH3)(OEt)(CH3NC5H5)+ could be easily obtained and characterized by using, as reducing agent, N-methyldihydropyridine. Whereas phenyl-substituted pyridinium complexes easily transferred the benzylidene moiety to alkenes, alkyl-substituted complexes appeared more reluctant to such a transfer:\xe2\x80\x89 satisfactory results were observed in the case of nucleophilic olefins such as enol ethers. However, straightforward transfer of the tungsten(0) alkylidene group took place, even at room temperature, in the case of alkoxycarbene complexes tethered to alkenes, giving access, upon intramolecular cyclopropanation reactions, to polycyclic systems.

"Despite the fact that acridine (1) and diphenylacetic acid (a) are achiral compounds, a chiral two-component molecular crystal (1\xc2\xb7a) in which two molecules are self-assembled in a 1:1 molar ratio by hydrogen bonding crystallizes spontaneously from an acetonitrile solution. The space group is P212121, which is typical chiral space group. Both handed crystals (\xe2\x88\x92)-1\xc2\xb7a and (+)-1\xc2\xb7a can be prepared as desired on a large scale by seeding. The two phenyl planes and the carboxyl plane of the diphenylacetic acid molecule in the crystal (\xe2\x88\x92)-1\xc2\xb7a have torsions in the same direction as the blades of a propeller. The oppositely handed crystal (+)-1\xc2\xb7a has minus torsion angles. Irradiation of (\xe2\x88\x92)-1\xc2\xb7a or (+)-1\xc2\xb7a caused stereospecific decarboxylating condensation to give an excess of the chiral compound {(\xe2\x88\x92)-3} or {(+)-3} in about 35% ee, respectively, as the main product. The absolute configurations of the reactant (\xe2\x88\x92)-1\xc2\xb7a and the product (\xe2\x88\x92)-3 could be determined to be (M)-(\xe2\x88\x92)-1\xc2\xb7a and (S)-(\xe2\x88\x92)-3 by the Bijvoet method based on anomalous dispersion of an oxygen atom of (\xe2\x88\x92)-1\xc2\xb7a and a sulfur atom of the trifluoromethanesulfonate salt of methylated (\xe2\x88\x92)-3 during X-ray crystallographic analysis. Upon irradiating (M)-(\xe2\x88\x92)-1\xc2\xb7a, the diphenylmethyl radical and the hydroacridine radical are produced via electron transfer from a to 1 and subsequent proton transfer followed by decarboxylation. The next radical coupling occurs with the shortest distance of 5.1 \xc3\x85 between the two preradical carbon atoms in the crystal lattice to afford (S)-(\xe2\x88\x92)-3 as the major enantiomer. On the other hand (R)-(+)-3 can be produced as the minor enantiomer by coupling over a longer distance of 6.8 \xc3\x85, resulting in a ca. 2:1 of S:R ratio, i.e., about 35% ee. The radical coupling is necessarily accompanied by a slight movement of the radical species in the crystal lattice, in contrast to the well-known topochemical [2+2] photocycloaddition. "
"Laser flash photolysis of 9-hydroxy-9-fluorenecarboxylic acid in hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) generates a transient with \xce\xbbmax at 495 nm that reacts with nucleophiles such as methanol and bromide and is insensitive to oxygen. In the presence of 0.15 M trifluoroacetic acid, a different transient with \xce\xbbmax at 560 nm that also reacts with nucleophiles is formed. The 495 and 560 nm species are identified as a zwitterion (the 9-carboxylate-9-fluorenyl cation) and its conjugate acid (the 9-carboxy-9-fluorenyl cation), respectively. The assignment of the zwitterion is supported by the observation of infrared absorptions in the carboxylate region that are quenched by nucleophiles with rate constants similar to those obtained by UV\xe2\x88\x92visible detection. Both the zwitterion and its protonated form are observed at intermediate acid concentrations, leading to an estimate of 1 \xc3\x97 10-2 M-1 for the equilibrium constant for the ionization of the 9-carboxy-9-fluorenyl cation in HFIP. Absolute rate constants for reaction of the zwitterion with alcohols, anionic nucleophiles, and substituted aromatics are reported and compared to data for other 9-fluorenyl cations. "
"Xestospongin A [also known as araguspongine D (1)], a C2-symmetric macrocyclic alkaloid isolated from the sponge Xestospongia exigua (Xestospongia sp.), and its C(9) epimer xestospongin C [also known as araguspongine E (2)] have been synthesized. The route capitalizes on the facile condensation between 5-halovaleraldehydes and 1,3-aminoalcohols to produce an oxaquinolizidine ring system in which all proper relative stereochemical relationships are controlled by equilibration. A linchpin synthesis was used to construct one key monomeric precursora 2,5-disubstituted thiophene derivative 26 [N\xe2\x89\xa1CCH2CH(OH)-2-Th-5-CH2CH2CH(CH(OMe)2)CH2CH2CH2Cl]. A second precursor lacking the thiophene ring 38 [N\xe2\x89\xa1CCH2CH(OH)(CH2)6CH(CH(OMe)2)CH2CH2CH2Cl] was assembled in a similar fashion. The carbinol center in each of these precursors was efficiently resolved enzymatically; lipase (PS-30) hydrolysis of the racemic acetate derivative of the thiophenemethanol derivative 26 and SP-435-catalyzed esterification of the \xce\xb2-hydroxynitrile 38 proved effective. The initial macrocyclization strategy involved (i) hydrolysis of a portion of monomer (+)-26 to the corresponding aldehyde, (ii) reduction of the nitrile to a 1,3-aminoalcohol derivative with a second portion of the monomer, (iii) condensation of these two, end-differentiated monomers to give the \xe2\x80\x9chalf-cyclized\xe2\x80\x9d oxaquinolizidine 30 that bears pendant nitrile and acetal groups, (iv) sequential reduction and acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to give the corresponding aldehyde ammonium ion 31, and v) dilution and elevation of pH leading to the macrocyclic bis-thiophene (\xe2\x88\x92)-32. Final reductive removal of both thiophenes with Raney nickel proceeded smoothly to give (+)-xestospongin A/(+)-araguspongine D (1). The impact of pH-control, concentration effects, and monomer rigidity on the macrocyclic dimerization event are discussed. A more direct strategy involved sequential nitrile reduction and acetal hydrolysis within (+)-26 and direct, two-stage macrocyclic dimerization to (\xe2\x88\x92)-32. Control of pH is important to the success of this cyclization. In an analogous fashion the non-thiophene monomer (\xe2\x88\x92)-38 was converted to the ammonium ion/aldehyde S-41. This could be used to probe the effect of substrate rigidity on the efficiency of macrocycle formation. Substrate S-41 spontaneously dimerized to produce a mixture of xestospongin A (1) and xestospongin C (2) with similar efficiency to the thiophene-containing 33. "
"Total syntheses of the representative phenanthroizidine alkaloids, tylophorine and antofine, and of their seco congeners, septicine and julandine, have been completed from sterically congested 3,4-diarylpyridines prepared by a modified Knoevenagel\xe2\x88\x92Stobbe synthesis. Central to the success of this effort was the ability of \xce\xb1-dicarbonyl enones to combine in a formal [4 + 2]-cycloaddition with sterically demanding vinyl ethers. "

"A new Zintl phase NaGaSn2 is obtained pure from stoichiometric reactions of the elements in sealed Ta at \xe2\x88\xbc450 \xc2\xb0C. Its orthorhombic framework structure (space group C2221, 6.309(3) \xc3\x97 10.986(4) \xc3\x97 6.162(4) \xc3\x85) contains one-dimensional helical pores \xe2\x88\xbc6 \xc3\x85 in diameter along c\xe2\x83\x97 (6 atoms/turn) that bind relatively well-ordered sodium countercations at 50% occupancy. The structure can also be described in terms of interlinked puckered double layers normal to b\xe2\x83\x97 and parallel to the channels. Gallium is disordered over both tetrahedral framework sites, the gallium-richer and more negative site having closer sodium neighbors. The potassium compound cannot be made. Among analogous phases reported by others, NaInSn2 has a lower symmetry and ordered cations, while NaGaSn5 cannot be reproduced. "
"At high pressures, there are large changes in the size and electron concentration of the alkali metals. As a result, significant changes should occur in the solid-state chemistry of these elements, allowing the formation of alkali metal\xe2\x88\x92transition metal compounds. The formation of two alkali metal\xe2\x88\x92transition metal compounds, K3Ag and K2Ag, is reported. These compounds rapidly form at room temperature upon compression of stoichiometric mixtures of the elements. K3Ag has a BiF3-type structure related to the bcc structure of potassium, with silver replacing some of the bcc potassium sites. The anisotropic \xcf\x89-phase structure of K2Ag consists of graphite-like layers of potassium atoms with silver atoms between the layers. At ambient pressure, lithium is the only alkali metal that forms compounds with silver. Thus, under pressure, potassium can exhibit chemical behavior exhibited by lithium at atmospheric pressure. "
"The synthesis and characterization of isocyanide complexes of (porphyrinato)iron(III) species, [(Porph)Fe(t-BuNC)2]ClO4, Porph = OEP, TPP, are reported. The crystal structures of [(TPP)Fe(t-BuNC)2]ClO4 and [(OEP)Fe(t-BuNC)2]ClO4 have been determined. Consistent with the expected effect from the strong \xcf\x80-acceptor character of the axial tert-butyl isocyanide ligands, the X-ray structure of the complex shows that the porphyrinate ring is strongly ruffled. The spectroscopic properties of these complexes suggest the possibility of \xe2\x80\x9cblurring\xe2\x80\x9d of the definitions of the electron configurations of low-spin Fe(III) macrocycles having (dxy)1 electronic ground states, with the extreme possibilities being low-spin Fe(III)-(macrocycle)2-, with the unpaired electron localized in the dxy orbital of the metal, and low-spin Fe(II)-(macrocycle)1-\xe2\x80\xa2, with the unpaired electron localized on the macrocycle. EPR spectroscopy of the TPP and OEP complexes shows that the g-values (g\xe2\x8a\xa5 = 2.20\xe2\x88\x922.28, g\xe2\x88\xa5 = 1.94\xe2\x88\x921.83) are consistent with an electron configuration that is (dxz,dyz)4(dxy)1, the purest (dxy)1 ground state system with the most complete quenching of orbital angular momentum discovered thus far (\xe2\x88\x91g2 as small as 13.5). Proton NMR spectra of [OEPFe(t-BuNC)2]ClO4 in CD2Cl2, recorded over the temperature range \xe2\x88\x92100 to +37 \xc2\xb0C, also support the (dxy)1 ground state, where ruffling of the porphyrinate ring makes it possible for unpaired electron spin delocalization to the 3a2u(\xcf\x80) orbital of the porphyrinate ring. This orbital has very large electron density coefficients at the meso positions and hence explains the very large negative contact shift of the meso-H; its size indicates considerable (\xe2\x88\xbc19%) spin delocalization from low-spin Fe(III) to the 3a2u(\xcf\x80) orbital by porphyrin \xe2\x86\x92 Fe \xcf\x80 donation. M\xc3\xb6ssbauer and IR spectral data are also consistent with the (dxy)1 ground state. "
"Reaction of (HBpz3)ReO(Ph)(OTf) with oxygen atom donors leads to oxidation of the phenyl group [HBpz3 = hydrotris(1-pyrazolyl)borate, OTf = triflate, OSO2CF3]. Reaction with Me2SO gives the adduct [(HBpz3)ReO(Ph)(OSMe2)]OTf, which undergoes phenyl-to-oxo migration at 25 \xc2\xb0C to give the phenoxide complex [(HBpz3)ReO(OPh)(OSMe2)]OTf and Me2S. The Me2SO adduct readily and reversibly loses Me2S (k = 2.9(4) s-1 at 25 \xc2\xb0C) as indicated by isotope exchange reactions and magnetization transfer. The Me2SO adduct also slowly oxidizes Me2SO to Me2SO2. These reactions all proceed via an intermediate rhenium(VII) dioxo complex, [(HBpz3)ReO2(Ph)]OTf. This dioxo complex can be observed at low temperature on reaction of (HBpz3)ReO(Ph)(OTf) with pyridine N-oxide. It rearranges at 0 \xc2\xb0C by phenyl-to-oxo migration to give phenoxide products and the catecholate complex (HBpz3)ReO(O2C6H4). The kinetics of this migration have been measured (\xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 14.8(7) kcal/mol, \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9220.5(25) eu). From these data and the activation parameters for reactions of [(HBpz3)ReO(Ph)(OSMe2)]OTf, a detailed free energy surface for the reactions of [(HBpz3)ReO2(Ph)]OTf is constructed. The dioxo complex reacts very rapidly with Me2S (1.7 \xc3\x97 105 M-1 s-1) with essentially no enthalpic barrier, consistent with the action of a highly electrophilic oxo ligand. Electrophilicity of the oxo groups is suggested to be a critical factor in facilitating the phenyl-to-oxo migration. A general explanation for the relative ease of various organometallic migration reactions, based on analogies with organic [1,2]-shifts, is presented. "
"The previously reported cationic dihydride complexes (PP3)MH2+ (M = Co, Rh and Ir; PP3 = P(CH2CH2PPh2)3) have been prepared using improved synthetic methods. Variable-temperature 1H and 31P NMR spectra of these complexes reveal complex dynamic behavior. The hydride region 1H NMR spectra have been accurately simulated at all temperatures using a simple site permutation model after taking into consideration the opposite signs of the cis and trans H\xe2\x88\x92P coupling constants. Partial deuteration of the hydride ligands in the rhodium and cobalt complexes is achieved by exposure to D2. In the partially deuterated samples, no evidence is found for a bound dihydrogen ligand, but the involvement of a dihydrogen species in the dynamic process which interchanges the two hydride positions remains a mechanistic possibility, as indicated by a kinetic isotope effect kH/kD = 1.3(1). The partially deuterated samples exhibit large and temperature-dependent isotope effects on the 1H NMR chemical shifts observed for the hydride resonances, which are attributed to isotopic perturbation of resonance. This arises from non-statistical occupation of the two different hydride sites and also leads to perturbation of the averaged H\xe2\x88\x92P coupling constants. Similar observations have been made for the neutral iron complex (PP3)FeH2. "
"We report pulsed Electron-Nuclear-DOuble-Resonance (ENDOR) experiments at 95 GHz and 1.2 K of single crystals of the blue-copper protein azurin and its fully 15N-enriched analogue. The nitrogen ENDOR spectra and their variation with the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the crystals are described, and it is shown that contributions of five distant nitrogens may be distinguished. For the remote nitrogens of the copper ligands histidines-46 and -117 complete hyperfine and quadrupole tensors are presented and discussed in relation to the structure of the copper site and the extension of the wave function of the unpaired electron. Besides these nuclei three backbone nitrogens show up in the ENDOR spectra, and their hyperfine tensors are reported. One of the backbone nitrogens concerns that of cysteine-112; the others are tentatively assigned to histidine-46 and glycine-45. The wave function of the unpaired electron of oxidized azurin is found to be smeared out over both the copper ligands and parts of the protein backbone. "
"While the strongly bound D3h AH3+ cations are favored energetically for CH3+ and SiH3+, Cs HA+\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7H2 complexes are computed to be the global minima for A = Sn and Pb. The structures, relative energies, and dissociation limits (Do) of the AH3+ cations (A = C, Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb) were studied at the Becke3LYP density functional level [6-311++G(2d,2p) basis sets for C, Si, and Ge, (quasi)relativistic effective core potentials with TZ+2P valence basis sets for Sn and Pb]. The SiH3+ potential energy surface computed for calibration at the CCSD(T) level is in very good quantitative agreement with the Becke3LYP results. The AH3+ \xe2\x86\x92 HA+\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7H2 rearrangement illustrates the rare case where two transition states are connected directly (one high-lying, 45\xe2\x88\x9258 kcal mol-1 vs D3h AH3+, and one lower in energy, 0\xe2\x88\x9237 kcal mol-1) without an intervening minimum. Due to the appreciable Do values for both the AH3+ and the HA+\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7H2 species, they should be experimentally verifiable. "
"A significant increase in the C\xe2\x88\x92O stretching force constant (FCO) and a decrease in C\xe2\x88\x92O bond length (rCO) result upon coordination of carbon monoxide to various cationic species. We report a study designed to elucidate the factors responsible for this effect. In particular, we distinguish between an explanation based on electrostatic effects and one based on withdrawal of electron density from the 5\xcf\x83 orbital of CO, an orbital generally considered to have some antibonding character. Ab initio electronic structure calculations on CO in the presence of a positive point charge (located on the carbon side of the bond axis) reveal that a simple Coulombic field increases the C\xe2\x88\x92O stretching force constant and decreases the bond length. Coordination of CO to a simple cationic Lewis acid such as H+ or CH3+ is calculated to increase FCO (and decrease rCO) to extents slightly less than those engendered by a point charge at the same distance from the carbonyl carbon. These results indicate that electron donation from the 5\xcf\x83 orbital has no intrinsic positive effect on the magnitude of FCO. Calculations were also conducted on several symmetrical, neutral, and cationic transition metal complexes, including some examples of the recently discovered homoleptic noble-metal carbonyls. It is found that FCO values can be quantitatively interpreted using a model which invokes only the effects of M\xe2\x88\x92CO \xcf\x80-back-bonding and an electrostatic parameter. There is no correlation between the extent of \xcf\x83-bonding (as measured by the depopulation of the CO \xcf\x83 orbitals) and FCO. Calculations on trigonal bipyramidal d8 metal pentacarbonyls permit a comparison between inequivalent ligands (axial and equatorial) which, being coordinated to the same metal center, must experience approximately the same electrostatic field. In the case of Ru(CO)5, \xcf\x80-back-bonding to the axial and equatorial carbonyls is of virtually equal magnitude, while \xcf\x83-donation is much greater from the axial ligands than from the equatorial ligands. Nevertheless, the FCO and rCO values of the two ligand sets are essentially equal, confirming that the magnitude of \xcf\x83-donation does not affect these parameters. "
"Ab initio calculations were performed to study the stability of various pyrophosphate species in the gas phase:\xe2\x80\x89 H4P2O7, H3P2O7-, H2P2O72-, HP2O73-, P2O74-, and their complexes with Mg2+. It is found that the metal cation allows the existence of highly charged anions in the gas phase. We also study the isomerization reactions Mg\xc2\xb7H2P2O7 \xe2\x86\x92 (H2PO4\xc2\xb7Mg\xc2\xb7PO3), (Mg\xc2\xb7HP2O7)- \xe2\x86\x92 (HPO4\xc2\xb7Mg\xc2\xb7PO3)-, and (Mg\xc2\xb7P2O7)2- \xe2\x86\x92 (PO4\xc2\xb7Mg\xc2\xb7PO3)2-, at the self-consistent-field (SCF) and second-order perturbation (MP2) levels of the theory, using a 6-31+G** basis set with diffuse and polarization functions. Other basis sets, including one of valence triple \xce\xb6 plus polarization (vTZP) quality, were employed to check for the convergence of the results. It is found that the same mechanism occurs for the isomerizations of the three species:\xe2\x80\x89 one of the P\xe2\x88\x92O bridging bonds of the reactant is longer than the other, and the route to the products proceeds through its elongation. This asymmetry is induced by the metal cation in the case of the evenly charged anions. In all cases the metal cation coordinates the transition states and the leaving groups. The structures found for the complexes (H2PO4\xc2\xb7Mg\xc2\xb7PO3), (HPO4\xc2\xb7Mg\xc2\xb7PO3)-, and (PO4\xc2\xb7Mg\xc2\xb7PO3)2- are different from those reported previously, the metal cation being enclosed by the two phosphates. The activation barrier increases with the charge of the anion, from \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 5.6 kcal/mol for the neutral complex Mg\xc2\xb7H2P2O7, to \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 10.4 kcal/mol for the monoanion (Mg\xc2\xb7HP2O7)-, to \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 13.5 kcal/mol for the dianion (Mg\xc2\xb7P2O7)2-. The positive value found for the energy of the isomerization (Mg\xc2\xb7P2O7)2- \xe2\x86\x92 (PO4\xc2\xb7Mg\xc2\xb7PO3)2-, \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 1.8 kcal/mol, predicts the synthesis to be spontaneous in the gas phase, opposite of what occurs in the aqueous solution. This result supports the view that the hydration energy makes a large contribution to the energy of hydrolysis. The gas-phase hydrolysis reaction H2O + Mg2+ + H2P2O72- \xe2\x86\x92 Mg2+ + H2PO4- + H2PO4- is also studied as a multistep reaction, involving the isomerization of H2O + (Mg\xc2\xb7H2P2O7) \xe2\x86\x92 H2O + (PO3\xc2\xb7Mg\xc2\xb7H2PO4) as an intermediate step. It is found that the equilibrium in the gas phase yields H2PO4\xc2\xb7Mg\xc2\xb7H2PO4 as the final species; an energy input is required for separating the metal cation from the phosphate anions. "
"The structural and electronic properties of bulk cubic and tetragonal tungsten trioxide are investigated using a periodic boundary condition ab initio Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock method; a posteriori density functional corrections are used to estimate the effect of electron correlation on the energy. The forces involved in the bonding between metal and oxygen are examined to shed light on the crystal chemistry of the compound. While the cubic phase is highly ionic, the symmetry distortion leading to the tetragonal phase causes an increase in covalence between tungsten and its nearest oxygen. The observed instability of cubic WO3 is explained by its higher energy (0.80 eV per formula unit) with respect to the tetragonal phase. We attribute this energy difference to the increased covalence observed in the latter phase. The calculated structural parameters for tetragonal WO3 agree with available experimental data. A layered structure emerges from our calculations for tetragonal WO3; when the effect of applying pressure is examined, only the interlayer spacing is appreciably modified. This softer degree of freedom results in a lower value of the bulk modulus when compared to that of the cubic phase. In the range of experimentally obtainable pressures, the order of stability of the two phases cannot be reversed, and the cubic structure remains unstable with respect to the tetragonal structure. "
"The short Li\xe2\x88\x92C distances (Li1\xe2\x88\x92C2 = 2.615(3) \xc3\x85, Li1\xe2\x88\x92C3 = 2.644(3) \xc3\x85) in the X-ray crystal structure of [Li\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92C(Me)\xe2\x88\x92(c-CHCH2CH2)2]6 (7)6 characterize Li\xe2\x88\x92cyclopropane edge coordinations. The Li\xe2\x88\x92cyclopropane interactions increase the C2\xe2\x88\x92C3 distances (1.519(3) \xc3\x85) relative to those of the free cyclopropyl edges (C2\xe2\x88\x92C4 = C6\xe2\x88\x92C7 = 1.499(2) \xc3\x85) by 0.02 \xc3\x85. The bent bonds of cyclopropane give rise to an electrostatic potential pattern, which strongly favors edge coordination as is observed experimentally in (7)6, but also permits a metastable Li+ face complex. The cyclopropane edge also is the favored site for hydrogen bonding, but not for protonation. The C\xe2\x88\x92C bond length elongations, the coordination energies Ecoord, and the charge redistributions upon metal cation edge interactions all are related to the distances between the cyclopropane C\xe2\x88\x92C bond centers and the cations. This is evaluated for the alkali metal cation\xe2\x88\x92cyclopropane complexes (cation = Li+ to Cs+). More generally, the cyclopropane C\xe2\x88\x92C bond length variations can be employed as a structural measure for the magnitudes of electrostatic interactions. "
"With the general aim to characterize the origin of electronic spectra of proteins, the present paper discusses the absorption spectra of a series of simple amides. Excited states were studied by means of ab initio quantum chemical methodsthe Complete Active Space (CAS) SCF method and multiconfigurational second order perturbation theory (CASPT2). We calculated the vertical absorption spectra of three primary amides (formamide, acetamide, and propanamide), two secondary amides (N-methylformamide and N-methylacetamide), and one tertiary amide (N,N-dimethylformamide). The calculations comprise a large number of singlet and triplet valence and Rydberg excited states. The results support a basic structure of the spectra:\xe2\x80\x89 In gas phase one intense valence \xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* transition is placed between 6.5 and 7.4 eV and a second weak valence \xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* transition occurs at 9.6\xe2\x88\x9210.5 eV. Alkyl substitutions on the nitrogen have a major effect on the valence transitions:\xe2\x80\x89 The energy drops when going from primary to secondary and tertiary amides. In contrast, only minor blue shifts of the excitation energies are observed when alkyl groups of different length are attached to the carboxyl group. For all molecules studied in this paper, n \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* transitions from the oxygen lone pair are found at about 5.5 eV and reveal only small sensitivity on the length of the alkyl substituent.

"The Complete Active Space (CAS) SCF method and multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) have been used in a theoretical analysis of the electronic spectra of glycine and N-acetylglycine. The calculations comprise a large number of singlet valence and Rydberg excited states. The electronic spectrum of glycine is dominated by excitations located at the carboxylic acid group. Two valence \xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* states (named NV1\xe2\x80\x98 and NV2\xe2\x80\x98) have been computed at 8.10 and 10.20 eV with intensities 0.194 and 0.125, respectively. We found in glycine two weak valence n \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* states 5.65 and 6.51 eV above the ground state. One involves excitations from the lone pair orbital on the carboxylic oxygen. The second can be characterized as an intramolecular charge transfer state from the amine terminal group to the peptide unit. A n \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x83* excited state comprising excitations from the in-plane lone pair of the nitrogen is suggested to be responsible for a weak band around 8.6 eV. The spectrum of N-acetylglycine is shown to be composed of the superposition of the spectra of the peptide bond and the carboxylic acid group, the chromophores forming the system. We computed for N-acetylglycine the NV1 amide band at 6.76 eV, the NV1\xe2\x80\x98 acid band at 8.55 eV, the NV2 band at 9.51 eV, and an intramolecular charge transfer state at 10.13 eV as the most intense features of the absorption spectrum. Based on these results and qualitative calculations on a simple dipeptidic system the most important features of the spectra of larger polypeptides are suggested to be composed of the following excitations:\xe2\x80\x89 a weak band at 5.5 eV is caused by the n \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* excitation from the oxygen lone pairs, a band at 6.5 eV due to \xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* NV1 transitions localized at the peptide group, a band at 7.5 eV due to charge transfer states involving electronic transitions between neighboring peptide units, and a broad band at higher energies which is mainly composed of the second \xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* NV2 valence state of the peptide group.

"The phosphate geometry was studied in crystal environment by analyzing 178 crystal structures and in vacuo by ab initio calculations of (di)hydrogen and dimethyl phosphates and a diphosphate model system, CH3OP(O2)O(CH2)3OP(O2)OCH3 (diPh), at the MP2 and HF levels. Since charge determines the phosphate stereochemistry, uncharged, \xe2\x88\x921, and \xe2\x88\x922 phosphates were analyzed separately. The PO and OPO bonding parameters depend only on charge and the number of carbon substituents while the remaining parameters depend also on substituent type; the largest sensitivity was observed for the CO and COP parameters. An acceptable agreement between the crystal and ab initio geometries was obtained only when basis sets contained polarization functions and a model system included a counterion (Na+). In uncharged and \xe2\x88\x921 phosphates, the COPO(C) torsion angles prefer the \xc2\xb1sc regions. These phosphates substituted by cyclic Csp3, noncyclic Csp3, or Car carbons have characteristic torsion distributions. Conclusion from both analysis of crystal data and from theoretical calculations is that the internal phosphate geometry is sensitive to a counterion position as well as to values of the COPO(C) torsion angles. Most metal cations interact directly with the charged oxygens in \xe2\x88\x921 phosphates while in many \xe2\x88\x922 phosphates, this interaction is mediated by water molecules. The distributions of Na+ around \xe2\x88\x921 and \xe2\x88\x922 phosphates are localized into two principal sites which lie outside the OPO plane and interact with only one of the charged oxygens. In contrast, theoretically predicted positions are located symmetrically between the charged oxygens in the OPO plane. The cation positions around dimethyl phosphate and a model diPh compound mimicking the B-DNA backbone were virtually identical. The discrepancy between these theoretical positions and the sites derived from the crystal data was significantly reduced by incorporation of a single water molecule into the theoretical model. Therefore, both cations and polar particles, particularly water molecules, should be considered when properties of the phosphate group are described. "
"Rate constants for the water, acetate, and hydroxide ion-catalyzed enolizations of the cationic ketones 2-acetyl-1-methylpyridinium ion (3) and 1-methyl-8-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolinium ion (4) have been measured at 25 \xc2\xb0C and compared with those reported for the enolization of 2-acetyl-3,4-dimethylthiazolium ion (2) (Halkides, C. J.; Frey, P. A.; Tobin, J. B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993 115, 3332). For 3, kH2O, kOAc, and kOH are 1.32 \xc2\xb1 0.21 s-1, (2.82 \xc2\xb1 0.95) \xc3\x97 10-2 M-1 s-1, and 187 \xc2\xb1 50 M-1 s-1, respectively. The corresponding values for 4 are 9.17 \xc2\xb1 0.24) \xc3\x97 10-2 s-1, (4.32 \xc2\xb1 0.18) \xc3\x97 10-4 M-1 s-1 and 10.9 \xc2\xb1 0.2 M-1 s-1, respectively. The values of pKa for 3 and 4 are 11.13 and 11.90, respectively, at 25 \xc2\xb0C. The hydration equilibrium constant Kh for 3 is 0.084 \xc2\xb1 0.004 at 25 \xc2\xb0C. The correlation of hydration constants for ketones with \xcf\x83* (Greenzaid, P.; Luz, Z.; Samuel, D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967 89, 749) allow the hydration constants for 2 and 3 to be used in the estimation of \xcf\x83* values for the substituents. The \xcf\x83* values are 1.68 and 1.02 for 2-(N-methylthiazolium) and 2-(N-methylpyridinium), respectively. Use of the \xcf\x83* values to estimate the inductive effects of these substituents on the pKas of 2 and 3 allows the inductive effects to be separated from the through-space electrostatic effects. The inductive effects are estimated to contribute 4.2- and 1.9-log units to lowering the pKas of 2 and 3, respectively. From this and the measured pKa of 11.1 for 3, the through-space electrostatic contribution to lowering the pKa is 6.3-log units, or 8.6 kcal mol-1 in free energy of enolate stabilization. Assuming the same through-space effect for 2, its pKa is estimated to be 8.8. Comparisons of these enolization rates and pKas with those for ordinary methyl and benzyl ketones indicate that the 2-(N-methylpyridinium) substituent in 3 stabilizes the enolate by 11.2 kcal/mol in free energy, and about 8.6 kcal/mol of this can be attributed to through-space electrostatic stabilization. The through-space electrostatic component accounts for a 330-fold enhancement in kOH for 3 compared with a typical methyl ketone (pKa = 19.3 for acetone). The value of kOH for 2 is 1.1 \xc3\x97 106 times that for a typical methyl ketone (pKa = 19.3) and 70 times that for a neutral methyl ketone exhibiting the pKa of 8.8 estimated for 2. The through-space electrostatic effects on the enolate of 2 and the transition state for its formation account for a 2.3 \xc3\x97 104-fold enhancement in the enolization rate. The remaining 47-fold rate enhancement for 2 is attributed to inductive effects. The through-space electrostatic effects have important implications for enzymatic catalysis of enolization. "
"The hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen increases the stability of the collagen triple helix. Previous X-ray diffraction analyses had demonstrated that the presence of an electron-withdrawing substituent on the pyrrolidine ring of proline residues has significant structural consequences [Panasik, N., Jr.; Eberhardt, E. S.; Edison, A. S.; Powell, D. R.; Raines, R. T. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994 , 44, 262\xe2\x88\x92269]. Here, NMR and FTIR spectroscopy were used to ascertain kinetic and thermodynamic properties of N-acetyl-[\xce\xb2,\xce\xb3-13C]d,l-proline methyl ester (1); N-acetyl-4(R)-hydroxy-l-proline [13C]methyl ester (2); and N-acetyl-4(R)-fluoro-l-proline methyl ester (3). The pKa\'s of the nitrogen atom in the parent amino acids decrease in the following order:\xe2\x80\x89 proline (10.8) > 4(R)-hydroxy-l-proline (9.68) > 4(R)-fluoro-l-proline (9.23). In water or dioxane, amide I vibrational modes decrease in the following order:\xe2\x80\x89 1 > 2 > 3. At 37 \xc2\xb0C in dioxane, the rate constants for amide bond isomerization are greater for 3 than 1. Each of these results is consistent with the traditional picture of amide resonance coupled with an inductive effect that results in a higher bond order in the amide CO bond and a lower bond order in the amide C\xe2\x88\x92N bond. Further, at 37 \xc2\xb0C in water or dioxane equilibrium concentrations of the trans isomer increase in the order:\xe2\x80\x89 1 < 2 < 3. Inductive effects may therefore accelerate the folding and enhance the stability of collagen, which has a preponderance of hydroxyproline residues, all with peptide bonds in the trans conformation.

"The syntheses, conformational study, and transannular \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interaction of multibridged [3n]cyclophanes including the ultimate member of this series, [36](1,2,3,4,5,6)cyclophane 1, are described. The stepwise construction of trimethylene bridges starting from [33](1,3,5)cyclophane 6 led to the synthesis of 1 by way of four- and five-bridged cyclophanes 7 and 8. The variable-temperature (VT) 1H NMR study (CD2Cl2) and molecular mechanics calculations (MM3) of five-bridged 8 revealed the most stable conformer, the relative stability order of the three stable isomers, and energy barriers for the trimethylene bridge inversion. A similar VT 1H NMR study (toluene-d8) of 1 suggests the presence of the trimethylene bridge inversion process between two C6h conformers. The charge transfer (CT) bands of the complexes of multibridged [3n]cyclophanes with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) show significant bathochromic shifts with the increase in the number of the bridges, and this is mainly attributed to the effective hyperconjugation between the benzyl hydrogens and the benzene rings. The CT band of the TCNE\xe2\x88\x921 complex (728 nm) is the longest wavelength among those of the TCNE complexes of [m.n]cyclophanes and multibridged benzenophanes. "
"The details of solution structure have proven difficult to probe experimentally, but computer simulations allow solvent structuring to be examined directly. We report here molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a series of pentose sugars in solution, describe in detail the three-dimensional structuring which these molecules impose on water, and relate this structuring to the solute molecular topologies. Well-defined first and second solvation shells are observed around the sugar molecules with specific locations determined by the arrangement of functional groups within each solute. Calculated molecular internal energies and solvent interaction energies generally correspond qualitatively with earlier models of sugar energetics based on stability factors. However, pairs of axial hydroxyl groups on the same side of a sugar ring were found to be disfavored by solvation energy, not by internal energy, which is actually more favorable due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding, in accord with both quantum mechanical calculations and a crystal structure for a related molecule determined by diffraction. A single axial hydroxyl group could be favored or disfavored energetically by hydration, depending on the particular circumstance. "
"KNI-272 is a peptidomimetic transition state analog inhibitor, having very high specificity and binding affinity for the HIV-1 protease. In order to understand the interactions that enhance drug binding to the protease, we recorded 2D water/NOESY and water/ROESY spectra to identify water molecules that bind tightly to the protease/KNI-272 complex. Well-ordered water molecules are observed at the protease/inhibitor interface in the crystal structure of the complex that have short interproton distances to the Ile50/150, Ala28/128, and Asp29/129 amide protons. The cross peaks between these protein protons and water protons, observed in water/NOESY and water/ROESY spectra, provide strong evidence that these water molecules are present in the solution structure of the complex. Analysis of measured NOE and ROE cross relaxation rates indicates that, in solution, these water molecules have long residence times, at least 1 ns and possibly greater than 7 ns. The presence of long-lived hydration water molecules at the protein/inhibitor interface suggests that interactions involving these water molecules contribute to the potency of the inhibitor. Hence, consideration of the potential role of hydration water molecules in stabilizing protein/inhibitor structures could contribute to improved drug design and to a better understanding of the mechanisms of drug resistance.

"A complete force field (MSXX) for simulation of all nylon polymers is derived from ab initio quantum calculations. Special emphasis is given to the accuracy of the hydrogen bond potential for the amide unit and the torsional potential between the peptide and alkane fragments. The MSXX force field was used to predict the structures, moduli, and detailed geometries of all nine nylons for which there are experimental crystal data plus one other. For nylon-(2n) with 2n \xe2\x89\xa4 6, the \xce\xb1 crystal structure (with all-trans CH2 chains nearly coplanar with the hydrogen bonding plane) is more stable, while for 2n > 6, \xce\xb3 (with the alkane plane twisted by 70\xc2\xb0) is more stable. This change results from the increased importance of methylene packing interactions over H bonds for larger 2n. We find the highest Young\'s modulus for nylon-7. "
"Adsorbate complexes formed by adsorption of methanol on zeolite H-ZSM-5 have been investigated by 1H, 2H, 13C, and 27Al NMR spectroscopy at temperatures between T = 425 K and T = 85 K. The data derived were explained by hydrogen-bonded neutral methanol molecules and partially protonated methanol clusters consisting of one and three methanol molecules per SiOHAl group, respectively. At T \xe2\x89\xa5 295 K, the hydroxyl protons of adsorbate complexes formed by one methanol molecule per SiOHAl group exhibit a high mobility and undergo a rapid chemical exchange. The 1H MAS NMR shifts (\xce\xb41H = 4.1 and 14.2 ppm) of the OH groups after adsorption of CD3OH and the 2H quadrupole coupling constants (QCC = 230 and 140 kHz) of the OD groups after adsorption of CH3OD, obtained at T \xe2\x89\xa4 153 K, correspond to those of rigid and hydrogen-bonded molecules. The 27Al quadrupole coupling constants of AlO4 tetrahedra involved in the local structure of bridging OH groups interacting with one and three methanol molecules (QCC = 8.0 and 2.5 MHz, respectively) depend on the number of adsorbate molecules and indicate a partial deprotonation of SiOHAl groups in the complexes formed by three methanol molecules per SiOHAl group.

"The X-ray crystal structure of d(CCTCTG*G*TCTCC)\xc2\xb7d(GGAGACCAGAGG), where G*G* represents the major adduct of the antitumor drug cisplatin on a duplex DNA dodecamer, was solved to a resolution of 2.6 \xc3\x85 (R = 0.203, R-free = 0.245). The molecule crystallizes in the space group P1, with unit cell dimensions a = 31.27 \xc3\x85, b = 35.46 \xc3\x85, c = 47.01 \xc3\x85, \xce\xb1 = 79.81\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb2 = 84.75\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb3 = 82.79\xc2\xb0, and Z = 2. Two molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by a local two-fold symmetry axis and have very similar structures. The duplexes are bent significantly, each having a 26\xc2\xb0 roll toward the major groove at the site of the platinum intrastrand cross-link. The platinum atom binds to the N7 atoms of adjacent guanine residues, compacting the major groove and widening and flattening the minor groove. Because of the shallow roll, the platinum atom is displaced from the planes of the guanine bases by \xe2\x88\xbc1 \xc3\x85 and is considerably strained. The overall structure of the cisplatin-modified duplex contains an unusual juxtaposition of A-like and B-like helical segments. This bent structure is accommodated by an interesting and novel packing arrangement in the crystal. One end of each duplex packs end-to-end with another, as in crystal structures of B-DNA, whereas the other end packs into the minor groove of an adjacent molecule, much like A-DNA crystal packing. An unusual backbone-to-backbone packing interaction involving several CH\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O hydrogen bonds was also observed. The widened minor groove and the bend caused by platinum binding resembles the DNA component of the structure of the HMG domains of SRY bound to its recognition site DNA. This similarity suggests how HMG-domain proteins might recognize cisplatin\xe2\x88\x92DNA adducts. "
"The synthesis of a novel sapphyrin\xe2\x88\x92oligonucleotide conjugate is described along with its DNA photocleavage and nucleic acid binding properties. The sapphyrin\xe2\x88\x92oligonucleotide conjugate produces photodamage on a complementary oligonucleotide target when irradiated at wavelengths above 620 nm. Upon piperidine treatment, guanine residues on the target strand in the vicinity of the sapphyrin macrocycle are found to be cleaved more effectively than guanines remote from the sapphyrin subunit. No sequence-specific photomodification was observed when noncomplementary oligonucleotides were used as a target. The duplexes formed between the sapphyrin conjugate and complementary nucleic acids were found to have higher melting temperatures than analogous control systems consisting of unmodified oligonucleotides of the same sequence. Melting temperature studies using variable salt concentrations and oligonucleotide targets indicate that the binding enhancement is due to hydrophobic interactions. The sapphyrin unit attached to an oligonucleotide can thus serve a dual role; it can act as a sequence-specific photomodification agent at irradiation wavelengths >620 nm, and it can increase the affinity of a sapphyrin-bearing oligonucleotide to a complementary sequence.

"Solvolyses of mesylate and trifluoroacetate derivatives of 3-aryl-3-hydroxy-substituted \xce\xb2-thiolactams and \xce\xb2-lactams proceeds to give substitution products in a process which exhibits a large solvent effect as well as large substituent effects. A common ion rate suppression as well as largely racemic products from solvolyses of an optically active substrate all point to the involvement of \xce\xb2-lactam derived carbocationic intermediates. Unlike acyclic analogs, these cations are captured by solvent to give simple substitution products with no competing proton loss. Computational studies suggest that proton loss from these \xce\xb2-lactam derived cationic intermediates is an unfavorable process due to antiaromatic character in the potential elimination product. Computational studies also suggest that CS and CO conjugative stabilization of these cations is minimal or non-existent. Substituent effect studies show that the major mode by which these cations derive stabilization is by aryl group charge delocalization. Azide ion in DMSO or DMF reacts with N-methyl-3-mesyloxy-3-phenylazetidine-2-thione via a bimolecular substitution mechanism to give the corresponding 3-azido substitution product, which can be converted to N-methyl-3-amino-3-phenylazetidine-2-thione.

"Nanosecond laser flash photolysis studies have been carried out of the kinetics of inter- and intramolecular phenolic hydrogen abstraction by alkoxyacetophenone, 5-alkoxyindanone, and 4-alkoxybenzophenone triplets in acetonitrile and benzene solution. Information on the geometric requirements for abstraction by carbonyl n,\xcf\x80* and \xcf\x80,\xcf\x80* triplets is derived from the results for a series of ketones which contain a para-phenolic moiety attached via a para-oxyethyl linkage. For all of these compounds, the deuterium kinetic isotope effect on the triplet lifetime in acetonitrile solution indicates that triplet decay is determined by the rate of intramolecular abstraction of the remote phenolic hydrogen, which yields the corresponding phenoxyl\xe2\x88\x92hemipinacol biradical. The biradicals have also been detected, and are about an order of magnitude longer-lived than the triplet in each case. For three of the compounds, the rates of the intramolecular process follow the same trend as that observed in the rates of bimolecular quenching of the parent methoxy-substituted ketones by p-cresol. Deviation from this trend is observed for the alkoxyindanone derivative, where an in-plane approach of the phenolic hydrogen to the carbonyl n-orbital is not possible. The trends in the rate constants for bimolecular quenching of a series of substituted benzophenones by p-cresol indicate that for n,\xcf\x80* triplet abstractions, the quenching mechanism is different for electron donor-substituted and electron acceptor-substituted ketones. For \xcf\x80,\xcf\x80* triplets and donor-substituted (n,\xcf\x80* triplet) benzophenones, abstraction is proposed to occur by a mechanism involving the intermediacy of a hydrogen-bonded exciplex, which yields the corresponding radicals by sequential electron- and proton-transfer. The rate constant for quenching by this mechanism thus depends mainly on the basicity of the ketone triplet state and the oxidation potential of the phenol. "
"A procedure is described which allows for the first time to perform chromium-catalyzed additions of organic halides to aldehydes (\xe2\x80\x9cNozaki\xe2\x88\x92Hiyama\xe2\x88\x92Kishi reactions\xe2\x80\x9d). The reactions are mediated by trimethylchlorosilane, and the active Cr2+ species is constantly recycled by means of nontoxic, commercial manganese powder as the stoichiometric reductant. This method nicely applies to different substituted aryl, heteroaryl, alkynyl, alkenyl, and allyl halides as well as to alkenyl triflates as the starting materials and rivals its stoichiometric precedent in terms of efficiency, practicability, and chemo- and diastereoselectivity. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that the addition of crotyl bromide to various aldehydes is highly stereoconvergent, i.e. the respective anti-configurated homoallyl alcohols are obtained with excellent diastereomeric excess independent of whether the starting halide is (E)- or (Z)-configurated. In accordance with the likely catalytic cycle, both CrCl2(cat.) or CrCl3(cat) turned out to efficiently mediate reactions of this type, with the latter being preferred for practical reasons. Finally, attempts were made to optimize the number of turnovers in chromium. In this context the use of either chromocene (Cp2Cr) or CpCrCl2\xc2\xb7THF as \xe2\x80\x9cpre-catalysts\xe2\x80\x9d were found to significantly upgrade the efficiency of such C\xe2\x88\x92C bond formations, with \xe2\x89\xa41 mol % of chromium being required in these cases for quantitative conversions.

"The first total synthesis of lissoclinamide 7, a 21-membered cyclopeptide isolated from Lissoclinum bistratum, was accomplished in 23 steps and 4.4% overall yield. The extraordinary configurational lability of the thiazoline segments was overcome by a novel strategy combining the use of the Burgess reagent for multiple simultaneous oxazoline and thiazoline formations and an efficient oxazoline \xe2\x86\x92 thiazoline heterocycle interconversion. In addition to the total synthesis, this work highlights the scope of alternative strategies toward Lissoclinum peptides and presents the preparation of analogues for SAR studies of the cytotoxic effects of this family of marine natural products.

"Biomimetic analogs 1 of the microbial siderophore (iron carrier) ferrichrome were labeled with a fluorescent marker at a site which does not interfere with iron binding or receptor recognition to provide iron(III) carriers 5 and 10 (Figure 1). These carriers were built from a tetrahedral carbon as an anchor which was symmetrically extended by three converging iron-binding chains and a single, exogenous anthracenyl residue. Carriers 5 varied in the nature of the amino acids (G = glycyl, A = alanyl and L = leucyl) linking the anchor with the iron-binding hydroxamate groups, while the alanyl derivative 10A differed from 5A in the spacer between the anthracenyl label and the anchor. Examination of these binders by 1H NMR confirmed that their conformations were analogous to those of the nonlabeled parent compounds. Titration experiments using UV/vis and fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated the quenching of these compounds\' fluorescence upon iron(III) loading and its recovery upon iron(III)\'s release to a competing chelator. The quenching process fits the Perrin model for static quenching and was more efficient in derivatives 5, where the label could approach the iron-binding domain, than in derivative 10A, where the label\'s approach was prohibited. These data are in compliance with an intramolecular quenching process. In vivo examination of the labeled derivatives 5 with Pseudomonas putida as the indicator organism established that their behavior parallels that of the nonlabeled analogs 1, with the added benefit of signaling microbial activity by fluorescence emission. Thus incubation of P. putida with iron(III)-loaded (and therefore nonfluorescent) 5G caused buildup of the label\'s fluorescence in the culture medium. These observations provide direct evidence for a shuttle-mechanism of iron delivery where the fluorescent, iron-unloaded carrier is released to the medium. Inhibition of both phenomena by natural ferrichrome or NaN3 demonstrates the involvement of the microbial ferrichrome receptor and transport systems, respectively. On the other hand, 5A induced only modest iron(III) uptake by P. putida and failed to generate fluorescence in the culture medium, concurring with its action as an inhibitor. The fact that two strains of different Pseudomonas species did not respond to the ferrichrome analog 5G illustrates the specificity of these compounds. The performance of these carriers as structural and functional probes, paired with their high species specificity, encourage their consideration as diagnostic tools for the detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria and fungi.

"A series of homo- and heterotrinuclear complexes containing three face-sharing octahedra has been synthesized by using the pendent arm macrocyclic ligands 1,4,7-tris(3,5-dimethyl-2-hydroxybenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, L0H3, and 1,4,7-tris(4-tert-butyl-2-mercaptobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, LH3:\xe2\x80\x89 [{L0NiII}2NiII] (1) and [{LCoIII}2CoIII](PF6)3 (2); [{LCoIII}2Ni]n+ (n = 2 (3), 3 (4), 4 (5)); [{LNi}2CoIII]n+ (n = 1 (6), 2 (7), 3 (8)) and its linkage isomers [{LNi}Ni{CoIIIL}]n+ (n = 1 (9), 2 (10), 3 (11)) and, finally, the complexes [{LNi}2Ni]n+ (n = 0 (12), 1 (13), 2 (14), 3 (15)). In complex 1 three octahedral NiII ions form a linear array with two terminal [L0NiII]- moieties in a facial N3O3 donor set and a central NiII ion which is connected to the terminal ions via six phenolate bridging pendent arms of L0. In complexes 2\xe2\x88\x9215 the three metal ions are always in the same ligand matrix yielding an N3M(\xce\xbc-S)3M(\xce\xbc-S)3MN3 first-coordination sphere regardless of the nature of the metal ions (nickel or cobalt) or their formal oxidation states. From temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements it has been determined that 1 has an S = 3 ground state whereas in 12 it is S = 1. In order to understand this difference in exchange coupling (ferromagnetic in 1 and antiferromagnetic in 12) in two apparently very similar complexes the magnetic properties of 2\xe2\x88\x9215 have been investigated. Complex 3 has an S = 1 and 4 an S = 1/2, and 5 is diamagnetic (S = 0) as is its isoelectronic counterpart 2. This indicates the availability of the oxidation states II, III, and IV of the central NiS6 unit. In the isostructural complexes 6, 7, and 8, two terminal nickel ions are bridged by a central diamagnetic CoIII. The exchange coupling between two terminal paramagnetic nickel ions was studied as a function of their formal oxidation state. In 6 the two NiII ions are ferromagnetically coupled (S = 2); the mixed-valent NiIINiIII species 7 has an S = 3/2 ground state and in 8 most probably two NiIII ions (d7 low spin) give rise to an S = 1 ground state. In contrast, in the series 9, 10, and 11 where two nickel ions are in a position adjacent to each other 9 has an S = 0 (antiferromagnetic coupling), but in the mixed-valent complex 10 an S = 3/2 ground state (ferromagnetic coupling) is observed. In 11 an S = 1 ground state prevails which may be achieved by ferromagnetic coupling between two NiIII ions. For the trinuclear nickel complexes 12\xe2\x88\x9215 an S = 1 ground state has been determined for 12, an S = 3/2 for the mixed valent complex 13, and an S = 2 for 14, and 15 exhibits an S = 3/2 ground state. The Goodenough\xe2\x88\x92Kanamori rules do not provide a consistent explanation for the observed ground states in all cases. The concept of double exchange, originally introduced by Zener in 1951, appears to provide a more appropriate description for the mixed-valent species 7, 10, 13, 14, and 15. This picture is corroborated by the electrochemistry and EPR spectroscopy of complexes. "
"The electronic and redox properties of the iron and tungsten centers in the aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductases (AORs) from Pyrococcus furiosus (Pf) and Pyrococcus strain ES-4 (ES-4) have been investigated by the combination of EPR and variable-temperature magnetic circular dichroism (VTMCD) spectroscopies. Parallel- and perpendicular-mode EPR studies of ES-4 AOR reveal a redox inactive \xe2\x80\x9cg = 16\xe2\x80\x9d resonance from an integer spin paramagnet. On the basis of the X-ray crystal structure of Pf AOR (Chan, M. K.; Mukund, S.; Kletzin, A.; Adams, M. W. W.; Rees, D. C. Science 1995, 267, 1463\xe2\x88\x921469), this resonance is attributed to a mononuclear high-spin Fe(II) ion at the subunit interface, although the possibility that this center is a carboxylate-bridged reduced diiron center in ES-4 AOR is also considered. Both enzymes have a [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]2+,+ cluster with unique electronic properties compared to known synthetic or biological [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]+ clusters, i.e. pure S = 3/2 ground state with g = 4.7, 3.4, 1.9 (E/D = 0.12 and D = +4 cm-1). Seven distinct W(V) EPR signals have been observed during dye-mediated redox titrations of Pf AOR, and the four major W(V) species have been rigorously identified and characterized via EPR spectral simulations of natural abundance and 183W-enriched samples (183W, I = 1/2, 14.28% natural abundance). Both enzymes contain two major forms of W, each corresponding to approximately 20\xe2\x88\x9230% of the total W. One of these is a catalytically competent W species that cycles between the W(IV)/W(V)/W(VI) states at physiologically relevant potentials (<\xe2\x88\x92300 mV) and gives rise to the \xe2\x80\x9clow-potential\xe2\x80\x9d W(V) resonance, g \xe2\x88\xbc 1.99, 1.90, 1.86. This form of W is quantitatively and irreversibly converted into a distinct and inactive W(IV)/W(V) species by the addition of high concentrations of glycerol or ethylene glycol at 80 \xc2\xb0C and is responsible for the \xe2\x80\x9cdiol-inhibited\xe2\x80\x9d W(V) resonance, g \xe2\x88\xbc 1.96, 1.94, 1.89. The other major form of W gives rise to a \xe2\x80\x9chigh-potential\xe2\x80\x9d W(V) species, g \xe2\x88\xbc 1.99, 1.96, 1.89, at nonphysiologically relevant potentials (>0 mV), as a result of a one-electron redox process that is tentatively attributed to ligand based oxidation of a W(VI) species. In addition, active samples of Pf AOR, in particular, can have up to 20% of the W as an inactive W(VI)/W(V) species, with a midpoint potential close to \xe2\x88\x92450 mV, and is responsible for the \xe2\x80\x9cspin-coupled\xe2\x80\x9d W(V) resonance. This W(V) signal exhibits a broad complex resonance spanning 600 mT due to weak spin\xe2\x88\x92spin interaction with the nearby S = 3/2 [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]+ cluster. Structures are proposed for each of the major W(V) species on the basis of EPR g values and 183W A values as compared to other biological and synthetic W(V)/Mo(V) centers, VTMCD spectra, and the available X-ray crystallographic and XAS data for Pf AOR and the Mo-containing DMSO reductase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Comparison with the limited spectroscopic data that are available for all known tungstoenzymes suggests two major classes of enzyme with distinct active site structures. "
"The diphosphine 1,3-bis[(di-tert-butylphosphino)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (1a) upon reacting with the rhodium and iridium olefin complexes M2(olefin)4Cl2 (M = Rh, Ir) undergoes rapid, selective metal insertion into the strong unstrained aryl\xe2\x88\x92methyl bond under very mild conditions (room temperature), yielding ClM(CH3)[C6H(CH3)2(CH2P(t-Bu)2)2] (M = Rh (4a), Ir (7a)). The carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon bond activation is competitive with a parallel C\xe2\x88\x92H activation process, which results in formation of complexes ClMH(L)[CH2C6H(CH3)2(CH2P(t-Bu)2)2] (M = Rh (3a), Ir (6a); L = cyclooctene in the case of 6a and is absent in 3a). Complexes 3a and 6a undergo facile C\xe2\x88\x92H reductive elimination (at room temperature (3a) or upon moderate heating (6a)), followed by C\xe2\x88\x92C oxidative addition, resulting in clean formation of 4a and 7a, respectively. The C\xe2\x88\x92C bond activation products are stable under the reaction conditions, demonstrating that this process is the thermodynamically favorable one. X-ray single-crystal analysis of 4a demonstrates that the rhodium atom is located in the center of a square pyramid, with the methyl group occupying the position trans to the vacant coordination site. Direct kinetic comparison of the C\xe2\x88\x92C and C\xe2\x88\x92H activation processes shows thatin contrast to theoretical calculationsmetal insertion into the carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon bond in this system is not only thermodynamically but also kinetically preferred over the competing insertion into the carbon\xe2\x88\x92hydrogen bond. When the ligand 1,3-bis[(di-tert-butylphosphino)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethyl-5-methoxybenzene (1b), bearing the strong electron-donating methoxy group in the position trans to the Ar\xe2\x88\x92CH3 bond to be cleaved, was used instead of 1a, no effect on the reaction rate or on the ratio between the C\xe2\x88\x92H and C\xe2\x88\x92C activation products was observed. Our observations indicate that the C\xe2\x88\x92C oxidative addition proceeds via a three-centered mechanism involving a nonpolar transition state, similar to the one proposed for C\xe2\x88\x92H activation of hydrocarbons. An \xce\xb72-arene complex is not involved in the C\xe2\x88\x92C activation process. "
"Rhenium(V) oxo alkyl triflate compounds (HBpz3)ReO(R)OTf [R = Me (4), Et (5), n-Bu (6); HBpz3 = hydrotris(1-pyrazolyl)borate; OTf = OSO2CF3, triflate] are formed on sequential reaction of (HBpz3)ReOCl2 with dialkyl zinc reagents and AgOTf. These triflate compounds are rapidly oxidized at ambient temperatures by oxygen atom donors pyridine N-oxide (pyO) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to give (HBpz3)ReO3 (7) and the corresponding aldehyde. In the cases of 5 and 6 this transformation is quantitative. The addition of 2,6-lutidine to a low-temperature oxidation of 5 by DMSO redirects the reaction to form cis-2-butene instead of acetaldehyde. These oxidation reactions do not proceed through alkoxide intermediates, as shown by independent studies of alkoxide oxidations. Reaction of 5 with pyO or DMSO at \xe2\x88\x9247 \xc2\xb0C results in the formation of intermediates which are assigned as ylide or \xe2\x80\x9ctrapped-carbene\xe2\x80\x9d complexes [(HBpz3)ReO(OH){CH(L)CH3}]OTf (L = py (8) or SMe2 (9), respectively). Mechanistic studies and analogies with related systems suggest that oxygen atom transfer to 4-6 forms [(HBpz3)ReO2R]+. Transfer of an \xce\xb1-hydrogen from the alkyl group to an oxo ligand then forms an alkylidene complex which is trapped by SMe2 or py to give the observed intermediates. Further oxidation of the ylide complex gives the aldehyde. "
"Electron photodetachment spectra of three alkoxide ions, 2,2-dimethyl-3-pentoxide, 3,3-dimethyl-2-butoxide, trifluoroethoxide, and two complex ions, 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanol/fluoride, 2,2-dimethyl-3-pentanol/fluoride, have been measured using an ion cyclotron spectrometer to generate, trap, and detect the ions. The electron affinities of trifluoroethoxide, 2,2-dimethyl-3-pentoxide, and 3,3-dimethyl-2-butoxide were measured as 58.9 \xc2\xb1 0.1, 47.8 \xc2\xb1 0.3, and 45.7 \xc2\xb1 0.1 kcal mol-1, respectively. Using known proton affinities of the three alcohols allows us to determine the O\xe2\x88\x92H bond dissociation energies. The threshold detachment energies for 2,2-dimethyl-3-pentanol/fluoride and 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanol/fluoride complex ions are 70.3 \xc2\xb1 0.5, and 70.1 \xc2\xb1 0.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. The fluoride binding energies are thus on the order of 30 kcal mol-1. We show that the observation or non-observation of photodetachment for alcohol/fluoride ions depends only on the alcohol acidity. In complex ions of the form ROHF-, if ROH is more acidic than HF the structure is RO-\xc2\xb7HF, and if ROH is less acidic than HF the structure is ROH\xc2\xb7F-. A flat potential energy surface model is consistent with the experimental results. The experimental results show no evidence for unusual structural change or stabilization when a hydrogen bond forms between two acids with similar acidities. "
"Electron impact on fluorinated acetyl compounds RCOCF3 (R = OH, OSi(CH3)3, OCH3, CF3COCH2, CH3COCH2, CH3, 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3CH2) in an FT-ICR spectrometer yields ionic products of m/z = [M \xe2\x88\x92 HF]. These products are proposed to arise via a two-step mechanism:\xe2\x80\x89 upon electron impact the neutral precursor gives a fluoride ion\xe2\x88\x92neutral radical complex followed by a secondary reaction of the fluoride anion with the neutral radical, either nucleophilic substitution or proton transfer, to yield a biradical anion (distonic radical anion). These radical anions were isolated and their chemical properties were studied. They undergo reactions characteristic of closed-shell anions, e.g. proton transfer, or characteristic of open-shell species, e.g. radical addition\xe2\x88\x92elimination reactions. "
"Many ions of interest in condensed phase chemistry cannot be produced in the gas phase by conventional methods. This is particularly the case for multiply charged inorganic and bio-organic ions. However, these species can be produced by electrospray, which is a method with which electrolyte ions present in a solution can be transferred to the gas phase. An ion-source reaction chamber was developed with which the equilibrium constants of ion\xe2\x88\x92molecule equilibria and their temperature dependence can be determined, where the ions involved are produced by electrospray. The hydration equilibria Mz+(H2O)n-1 + H2O = Mz+(H2O)n were determined for Mz+ = Na+, K+, n-C3H7NH3+, n-C6H13NH3+. The \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0n-1,n, \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0n-1,n, and \xce\x94S\xc2\xb0n-1,n were found to be in good agreement with previous determinations where these ions were produced by conventional techniques. Equilibria determinations were also obtained for the diprotonated \xce\xb1,\xcf\x89-alkyldiammonium ions:\xe2\x80\x89 H3N(CH2)pNH32+ where p = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12. The \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 values obtained for these ions show that the hydration proceeds by water molecules occupying sequentially first the \xce\xb1 charge site and then the other site, \xcf\x89. It is found that the \xce\x94H\xc2\xb00,1 \xe2\x89\x88 \xce\x94H\xc2\xb01,2 and \xce\x94H\xc2\xb02,3 \xe2\x89\x88 \xce\x94H\xc2\xb03,4 where the second pair of enthalpies are slightly lower. The equality of the paired enthalpies is due to the large distance between the two charged sites. The entropy \xce\x94S\xc2\xb0n-1,n values also support alternate occupation of the \xce\xb1 and \xcf\x89 charge sites. Equilibria were determined also for the methylated analogues:\xe2\x80\x89 (CH3)3N(CH2)pN(CH3)32+, p = 2, 3, 4, 6. The hydration interactions for these ions is much weaker, as expected from previous work on the hydration of (CH3)4N+ by Meot-Ner and Deakyne. The observed entropy changes suggest a possible scheme of consecutive charged sites occupation which is different from that observed for the H3N(CH2)pNH32+ compounds. This different scheme is consistent with structure and energy predictions for the (CH3)4N+ hydrates due to Meot-Ner and Deakyne. "
"First hyperpolarizabilities of a large number of push\xe2\x88\x92pull substituted conjugated systems with heteroaromatic spacers have been calculated. The static, nonresonant components were computed at the ab initio level (4-31G basis) using the coupled perturbed Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock approach and at the AM1 level employing the finite field method. Sum-over-states procedure has also been used with the AM1/CI method to compute \xce\xb20 and \xce\xb2 at an excitation energy of 1.17 eV. The computed \xce\xb2 values at the various levels are reasonably similar and exhibit the same trends. The largest values are obtained with a donor on pyrrole and an acceptor on thiophene or thiazole. The variations do not always inversely follow the order of delocalization energies of the heterocyclic rings. The trends in the dipole moment changes and transition energies between the ground and first excited charge-transfer state primarily determine the variations in the computed \xce\xb2 values. "
"We have previously shown that methionine can be used as a \xe2\x80\x9cswitchable\xe2\x80\x9d residue for the design of peptides with alternative secondary structure preferences in the aggregated state (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 12609). Redox-induced secondary structure changes in the 18-residue peptide Ac-YLKAMLEAMAKLMAKLMA-NH2 result from conversion of lipophilic methionine (M) to hydrophilic methionine sulfoxide (M\xc2\xb0), which transforms a peptide capable of adopting an amphiphilic \xce\xb1-helical conformation into a peptide capable of adopting an amphiphilic \xce\xb2-strand conformation. Here we present a detailed characterization of the third oxidation state of this peptide, in which the methionine residues are oxidized to the sulfone state. The sulfone form behaves similarly to the sulfoxide form, even though the sulfone group is somewhat less hydrophilic than the sulfoxide group. These results provide support for the concept that the conformational preferences of peptides and proteins are strongly dependent upon the linear ordering of hydrophilic and lipophilic residues (\xe2\x80\x9camphiphilic order\xe2\x80\x9d).

"The decarboxylation of N-carboxy-2-imidazolidinone has previously been established as a model for the transfer of carbon dioxide from N(1\xe2\x80\x98)-carboxybiotin. The present paper reports the pH-dependence of the reaction as well as the acceleration of the reaction in methanol and in acetonitrile. These results suggest that enzymic reactions of N(1\xe2\x80\x98)-carboxybiotin in a hydrophobic active site with decreased hydrogen bonding can be rapid if the energy of desolvation is compensated by the energy made available by association of the substrate and protein. In addition, a report on the decarboxylation of N-carboxy-2-imidazolidinone in organic solvents containing macrocycles (Kluger, R.; Tsao, B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 2089\xe2\x88\x9290) must be reinterpreted on the basis of the inherent instability of the substrate under the reaction conditions. "
"A series of hemo-protein-derived photocatalysts, prepared by reconstitution of the respective apo-proteins with Co(II)-protoporphyrin IX and chemical modification of the protein with the eosin chromophore, is presented. Apo-myoglobin, Apo-Mb, was reconstituted with Co(II)-protoporphyrin IX and further modified with eosin-isothiocyanate (3) to yield the photocatalyst Eo2--Mb-Co(II). The protein is loaded by two eosin chromophore units. Photoexcitation of Eo2--Mb-Co(II) yields the electron transfer species Eo\xe2\x80\xa2--Mb-Co(I) formed by direct oxidative quenching of TEo2--Mb-Co(II), kq = 5.2 \xc3\x97 104 s-1, and via an indirect path where self-quenching of the eosin-chromophore units yields the intermediate redox products (Eo\xe2\x80\xa23- + Eo\xe2\x80\xa2-)-Mb-Co(II) that, in the presence of Na2EDTA, generate the Eo\xe2\x80\xa2--Mb-Co(I) in a secondary dark electron transfer, kr = 330 s-1. The reconstituted protein Eo2--Mb-Co(II) reveals photocatalytic features and its steady-state illumination in the presence of Na2EDTA yields hydrogen evolution, \xcf\x86 = 2 \xc3\x97 10-4, or photohydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene, \xcf\x86 = 1 \xc3\x97 10-2. The reconstituted photocatalyst Eo2--Mb-Co(II) reveals enzyme-like behavior. Photohydrogenation of acetylenedicarboxylic acid (6) by Eo2--Mb-Co(II) in the presence of Na2EDTA reveals stereospecificity and formation of maleic acid as the hydrogenation product and kinetics that follow the Michaelis\xe2\x88\x92Menten model, Km = 4 mM, Vmax = 0.6 \xce\xbcM\xc2\xb7min-1. Similarly, the \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-subunits of hemoglobin, Hb, were reconstituted with Co(II)-protoporphyrin IX to yield \xce\xb1-Hb-Co(II) and \xce\xb2-Hb-Co(II). The \xce\xb2-Hb-Co(II) was specifically modified at cysteine 93 residue by eosin maleimide (4) to form Eo2--\xce\xb2-Hb-Co(II). The \xce\xb1-Hb-Co(II) was modified at a single, unknown, lysine residue by eosin maleimide (4) to generate Eo2--\xce\xb1-Hb-Co(II). Only oxidative quenching proceeds in Eo2--\xce\xb2-Hb-Co(II) and Eo2--\xce\xb1-Hb-Co(II) to yield the redox photoproducts, Eo\xe2\x80\xa2--\xce\xb2-Hb-Co(I) and Eo\xe2\x80\xa2--\xce\xb1-Hb-Co(I), kq\xce\xb2 = 1.8 \xc3\x97 103 s-1 and kq\xce\xb1 = 6.5 \xc3\x97 103 s-1, respectively. The back electron-transfer rates of the redox species are kb\xce\xb2 = 0.37 \xc3\x97 103 s-1 and kb\xce\xb1 = 3.4 \xc3\x97 103 s-1, respectively. The site-specific modification at cysteine 93 residue of \xce\xb2-Hb by the chromophore and the known X-ray structure of \xce\xb2-Hb which defines the electron transfer distance in Eo2--\xce\xb2-Hb, d = 12.87 \xc3\x85, enabled the analysis of the experimental electron-transfer rate constants according to Marcus theory:\xe2\x80\x89 \xce\xbb = 1.1 eV; \xce\xb2 = 1.35 \xc3\x85-1. The reorganization energy, \xce\xbb, associated with the electron transfer in Eo2--\xce\xb1-Hb-Co(II) is similar, \xce\xbb = 1.15 eV. Application of the \xce\xb2-value extracted for the Eo2--\xce\xb2-Hb-Co(II) system to the Eo2--\xce\xb1-Hb-Co(II) assembly enabled estimation of the electron-transfer distance in the latter system, d = 11.2 \xc3\x85, and elucidation of the lysine-90 residue as the modification site by the eosin chromophore. The two reconstituted proteins, Eo2--\xce\xb1-Hb-Co(II) and Eo2--\xce\xb2-Hb-Co(II), reveal photocatalytic properties. Their steady-state irradiation in the presence of the Na2EDTA resulted in photohydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene, \xcf\x86\xce\xb1 = 0.02; \xcf\x86\xce\xb2 = 0.004. The photogenerated redox species of the reconstituted proteins Eo\xe2\x80\xa2--Mb-Co(I) and Eo\xe2\x80\xa2--\xce\xb1/\xce\xb2-Hb-Co(I) reveal pronounced stabilities against back electron transfer. This was attributed to spatial separation of the redox species by the rigid protein assemblies. The stability of the redox photoproducts Eo\xe2\x80\xa2--Mb-Co(I) enabled tailoring a cyclic photosynthetic assembly where the semisynthetic photoenzyme Eo2--Mb-Co(II) as a reductive biocatalyst is coupled to lactate dehydrogenase, LDH, an oxidative biocatalyst, using N-methylferrocene caproic acid (5) as diffusional electron mediator. Steady-state irradiation of an assembly composed of Eo2--Mb-Co(II), LDH, and 5 in the presence of acetylene and lactic acid yields the cyclic photoinduced hydrogenation of acetylene by lactic acid to yield ethylene and pyruvic acid, \xcf\x86 = 2 \xc3\x97 10-3. The system mimics artificially the functions of the photosynthetic bacteria chloroflexus. "
"Peptide-amphiphiles with collagen-model head groups and dialkyl chain tails have been synthesized and shown to self-assemble into highly ordered polyPro II like triple-helical structures when dissolved in aqueous subphases. Evidence for this self-assembly process has been obtained from (a) compression of stable peptide-amphiphile monolayers to molecular areas comparable with triple-helical areas, (b) circular dichroism spectra and melting curves characteristic of triple-helices, and (c) two-dimensional NMR spectra indicative of stable triple-helical structure at low temperatures and melted triple-helices at high temperatures. The thermal stability of the collagen-like structure in the peptide-amphiphile is substantially higher (\xce\x94Tm = 15\xe2\x88\x9220 \xc2\xb0C) than that of peptides without lipidation. The assembly process driven by the hydrophobic tail may provide a general method for creating well-defined protein molecular architecture using a minimalist peptide-based approach. "
"This article describes the synthesis, characterization, and kinetic studies of a new class of stable ribonuclease (RNase) inhibitors. Herein the first synthesis of oxorhenium(V) complexes of diaminonucleosides and diaminoaldopentofuranoses is reported. Stability studies have shown that the complexes are stable between pH 3 and 13 at temperatures of 25\xe2\x88\x9280 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h with no occurrence of ligand exchange or epimerization at the ReO core. Kinetic studies show that both the syn (1a) and anti (1b) diastereoisomers of oxorhenium(V) complexes of 9-(2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-diamino-2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-dideoxy-\xce\xb2-d-ribofuranosyl)adenine (13) are excellent inhibitors of the purine specific ribonuclease, RNase U2. Dixon and Lineweaver\xe2\x88\x92Burke analyses suggest that the inhibition is competitive, with inhibitory constants (Kis) of 15 and 93 \xce\xbcM, respectively. These complexes are of equivalent inhibitory potency to previously reported nucleoside vanadium alkoxide inhibitors with the added advantage of being completely stable in aqueous solution. The oxorhenium(V) complexes of 2,5-anhydro-3,4-diamino-3,4-dieoxy-d-ribitol (2a-Re) and (2b-Re) display much poorer inhibition (Ki > 2 mM), highlighting the critical nature of the purine base for successful inhibition.

"The radical allylation of a series of \xce\xb2-alkoxy esters using allyltrimethylsilane in the presence of MgBr2\xc2\xb7 OEt2 is described. Under bidentate chelation-controlled conditions, allyltrimethylsilane rivals allyltributyltin in efficiency and is a superior reagent from ecological and practical perspectives. The reactions work with iodides and bromides as well as phenylselenides. The isolation of \xce\xb3-phenylseleno intermediates indicates that the reaction proceeds by an atom transfer process. These reactions require initiation with Et3B and can be inhibited by galvinoxyl, m- and p-dinitrobenzene indicating that this atom transfer sequence involves the intermediacy of radicals. "
"Specific salting-in effects that lead to striking substrate selectivity were observed for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl alkanoates 2 (n = 2\xe2\x88\x9216) catalyzed by 4-(dialkylamino)pyridine-functionalized polymer 1 in aqueous Tris buffer solution at pH 8.0 and 30 \xc2\xb0C. Macromolecule 1 was found to exhibit clear substrate preference for 2 (n = 6) in 0.05 M aqueous Tris buffer solution, as contrasted with the corresponding reaction in 0.05 M aqueous phosphate or borate buffer solutions where the substrate selectivity is absent. The formation of a reactive catalyst\xe2\x88\x92substrate complex, 1\xc2\xb72, appears to be promoted by the presence of tris(hydroxymethyl)methylammonium ion, an efficient salting-in agent, from the Tris buffer system. The salting-in effect on formation of 1\xc2\xb72 complex is presumed responsible for the substrate specificity. The salting-out effects of sodium chloride on the solvolysis of 2 catalyzed by 1 were also investigated in 1:1 (v/v) methanol\xe2\x88\x92water solution at pH 8.0 and 30 \xc2\xb0C. The rate of 1-catalyzed solvolysis of 2 (n = 10\xe2\x88\x9216) was found to vary inversely with NaCl concentration (0\xe2\x88\x921.0 M). The magnitude of the salting-out effects is dependent on the alkyl chain length in 2 and the concentrations of 1 and NaCl. At 7.5 \xc3\x97 10-5 unit mol L-1 1 and 0\xe2\x88\x921.0 M NaCl the order of reactivity for 2 (n = 10\xe2\x88\x9216) was n = 10 > 12 > 14 > 16. However, at 5.0 \xc3\x97 10-6 unit mol L-1 1, a revised reactivity order, 2, n = 14 > 12 > 16, was obtained at [NaCl] < 0.15 M. A significant decrease in the substrate preference for 1-catalyzed solvolysis of 2 (n = 10\xe2\x88\x9216) was observed at higher NaCl concentrations. We suggest that the reduced catalytic efficiency and selectivity expressed by 1 in the presence of sodium chloride should be attributed to changes in the morphology and composition of aggregates containing 1 and 2 in aqueous methanol solution that lead to decreased dependence of aggregate formation on the hydrophobicity of the substrate.

"The effect of small strained rings on chemical reactivity was probed by the examination of the behavior of vinylcyclobutanols as terminators in cyclization reactions. The substrates were readily available by the addition of vinyllithium reagents bearing acetals as cyclization initiators to cyclobutanone. Bronsted and Lewis acids both promoted cyclization in contrast to vinylcyclopropanol terminators for which Bronsted acids failed. The products are spirocycles consisting of a cyclopentanone derived from ring expansion of the cyclobutanol and the second ring derived by attack of the terminator on the initiator. Spirocyclization to [4.5] and [4.6] systems proceeded smoothly, whereas spirocyclization to a [4.7] system failed. Attaching the cyclization termini to a preexisting ring system (whereby tricycles consisting of a fused bicycle and a spirocycle are formed) expands the scope of the cyclization to include the [4.7] ring system even at 0.01 M, a rather high concentration for such an unfavorable ring system. The diastereoselectivity generally placed the initiator substituent and the carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbonyl bond of the cyclopentanone ring trans on the newly formed ring. Cyclic acetals and the free aldehyde also served as initiators. The mechanistic implications of these observations are discussed. "
"The reactions of (E)-1-methoxy-1,3-butadiene (1) and 1,1-dimethoxy-1,3-butadiene (2) with a series of dienophiles of increasing electrophilicity are described. Stereochemical studies reveal that the cycloadditions of 1 are concerted processes, even for the most electron-deficient olefins dimethyl dicyanofumarate and dimethyl dicyanomaleate. 1,1-Dimethoxy-1,3-butadiene reacts under our conditions (dilute solutions and temperatures \xe2\x89\xa460 \xc2\xb0C) only with those dienophiles which can give zwitterions out of the antiperiplanar conformation of the diene. Zwitterionic intermediates can be trapped by methanol. In the case of tetracyanoethene the kinetics of decay of an intermediate, interpreted as the zwitterion, can be followed by stopped flow techniques:\xe2\x80\x89 Ea = 14.8 \xc2\xb1 0.2 kcal mol-1, log A = 11.9 \xc2\xb1 0.1, \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 10.8 \xc2\xb1 0.1 kcal mol-1, \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x926.2 \xc2\xb1 0.1 cal mol-1 K-1, and \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 11.40 \xc2\xb1 0.03 kcal mol-1.

"An ab initio MO-theoretical study (RHF/3-21G* basis set and single point Becke3LYP/6-31G*//RHF/3-21G* calculations) on transition structures (TS) and intermediates in (4 + 2) cycloadditions of (E)-1-amino- and (E)-1-hydroxy-1,3-butadiene, of (E,E)-1,4-diamino- and (E,E)-1,4-dihydroxy-1,3-butadiene, and of 1,1-diamino- and 1,1-dihydroxy-1,3-butadiene to acrylonitrile, fumaronitrile, and 1,1-dicyanoethylene is reported. The amount of dissymmetry in bond formation increases with the capability of the reactants to stabilize a positive or negative charge. A main reason for the concomitant decrease in activation energy derives from polar interactions due to the transfer of charge from donor diene to acceptor dienophile. Zwitterions are located in the cycloaddition of 1,1-diamino- and 1,1-dihydroxy-1,3-butadiene to 1,1-dicyanoethylene if the solvent is included via the SCRF method. 1,1-Diamino- and 1,1-dihydroxy-1,3-butadiene form molecular complexes of van der Waals nature with 1,1-dicyanoethylene.

"The acylation of aromatic compounds with aroyl triflates can be performed in organic solvents (1,2-dichloroethane) without Friedel\xe2\x88\x92Crafts catalysts. These reaction conditions allow kinetic investigations of the reaction in homogeneous solution. From rate measurements evidence is given that in all cases the aroyl triflates 1, 6, and 11 dissociate primarily into the corresponding acylium ions which subsequently react with the aromatic compounds. The rate-determining step, either the dissociation of the aroyl triflates or the reaction of the acylium ions with the aromatic, can be assigned definitely from the experimental data. From the kinetic measurements in the presence of an excess of base unequivocal evidence of acylium ions as the reacting electrophiles in all cases investigated is given. "
"Addition of MesMgBr to mesitylphenylketene 3 yields a ca. 3:1 mixture of the magnesium enolates 5-(E) and 5-(Z), whereas reaction of enol 1-(Z) with MesMgBr results in the exclusive formation of enolate 5-(Z). Acetylation of the configurationally stable 5-(E) and 5-(Z) yields the enol acetates 4-(E) and 4-(Z), respectively. The preference for the formation of the (E)-enolate from 3 indicates that the attack occurs preferentially from the side of the formally bulkier mesityl ring. Ketene 3 and the two diastereomeric transition states obtained by attack of MeLi on its CO were calculated by ab initio calculations. 3 adopts a conformation with a planar Ph-CC moiety while the mesityl is nearly perpendicular to this plane. Since the attack on the CO group occurs in the plane of the CC double bond, the coplanar Ph is effectively bulkier to the approaching nucleophile than the twisted Mes and the preferred attack is from the mesityl side. Similar stereoelectronic effects operate in 1,2-dimesityl-2-phenylvinyl cation (10). "
"Phenylacetoxycarbene, phenyl(pivaloyloxy)carbene, and phenyl(benzoyloxy)carbene, photolytically generated from diazirine precursors in pentane at 25 \xc2\xb0C, efficiently rearranged by 1,2-acyl migrations to give high yields of the appropriate 1,2-diketones. The kinetics of these rearrangements were determined by laser flash photolysis. Substituent effects on the acyl migrations and ab initio electronic structure calculations on ground state carbenes and transition states were employed to analyze the rearrangement mechanism. Additions of phenylacetoxycarbene to alkenes proceeded in good yields, in lieu of the 1,2-acyl shift; absolute rate constants were obtained for these reactions of the ambiphilic carbene. (Phenoxymethyl)acetoxycarbene gave only a 1,2-H shift; the potentially competitive 1,2-acetyl migration was suppressed. "
"Dicarbalkoxyketenes 8a and 8b are obtained by photolysis of diazo esters 7 in cryogenic matrices or by FVT of 7 followed by matrix isolation. The photochemical Wolff rearrangement of diazomalonates 1 in Ar matrix at temperatures as low as 6.5 K produces alkoxy(alkoxycarbonyl)ketenes 3, also obtained by FVT of 1. Photolysis of 1 in CO matrix at \xe2\x89\xa56.5 K produces the dicarbalkoxyketenes 8. Ketenes 3, 8, and 12 react with pyridine above 40 K to produce ketene\xe2\x88\x92pyridine ylides (zwitterions) 9, 10, and 13, respectively. "
"The effect of \xce\xb1-(N,N-dimethylcarbamoyl) and \xce\xb1-(N,N-dimethylthiocarbamoyl) substituents on the rate constants for partitioning of \xce\xb1-substituted 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl carbocations between nucleophilic addition of 50:50 (v:v) MeOH/H2O (ks, s-1) and deprotonation by this solvent (ke, s-1) have been investigated. The data show that these \xce\xb1-amide and \xce\xb1-thioamide substituents result in 80-fold and \xe2\x89\xa530\xe2\x80\x89000-fold decreases, respectively, in ks for capture of the 4-methoxybenzyl carbocation by solvent, but that they lead to much smaller changes in ke for deprotonation of the corresponding \xce\xb1-substituted 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl carbocations by solvent. The large effect of the \xce\xb1-thioamide substituent on the partitioning of \xce\xb1-substituted 1-phenylethyl carbocations between formation of the products of solvolysis and elimination is therefore due primarily to the effect of this \xce\xb1-substituent on ks for capture of the carbocation by solvent. The results of experimental and computational studies are consistent with the conclusion that the relative magnitude of the rate constants ks and ke for partitioning of \xce\xb1-substituted 1-phenylethyl carbocations is strongly controlled by the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the neutral products of these reactions.

"This paper describes an experimental method for determining the relative stabilities of hydrogen-bonded aggregates in terms of the mole fraction of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in chloroform solution, \xcf\x87DMSO, required to cause their dissociation. It also describes three indicesITm, IG, and IG/(N\xe2\x88\x921)that estimate the relative stabilities of hydrogen-bonded aggregates. Each of these indices depend on two variables:\xe2\x80\x89 HB and N. HB is the number of hydrogen bonds holding the aggregate together; N is the number of particles in the aggregate. The melting-point index, ITm = HB/(N\xe2\x88\x921), corresponds conceptually to a \xe2\x80\x9cmelting point\xe2\x80\x9d for the aggregate, that is, a temperature at which it would dissociate into separate particles. This index is the most useful of the three for \xe2\x80\x9crule of thumb\xe2\x80\x9d estimation of relative stability if assembly occurs cooperatively. The free energy index, IG = 2.8HB \xe2\x88\x92 16(N\xe2\x88\x921), corresponds to a free energy of assembly, \xce\x94G, with units kcal/mol. The index IG/(N\xe2\x88\x921) = 2.8HB/(N\xe2\x88\x921) \xe2\x88\x92 16 corresponds conceptually to a free energy of association per particle, \xce\x94G/(N\xe2\x88\x921). This third index is most useful if assembly occurs noncooperatively. "
"The characterization of the Cr(V) intermediates in the reduction of Cr(VI) by l-ascorbic acid (l-AsA) in aqueous solution is described as a function of pH and ascorbate concentration. In the reaction of Cr(VI) with AsA at least seven EPR-active Cr(V) signals are present in addition to that of the ascorbate radical. The Cr(V)/ascorbate complex at giso = 1.9791 (Aiso = 16.4 \xc3\x97 10-4 cm-1) is much more stable in moderately acidic solution (pH 3\xe2\x88\x926) than in neutral and alkaline solutions. The reaction is affected by aerial O2 producing Cr(V)/ascorbate/peroxo complexes with signals at giso = 1.9818 (Aiso = 13.2 \xc3\x97 10-4 cm-1) and giso = 1.9812 and another at giso = 1.9824 (Aiso = 12.9 \xc3\x97 10-4 cm-1). These signals are most prominent at near physiological pH values (7\xe2\x88\x928), and all were absent when the solutions were preincubated with catalase. The Cr(V)/ascorbate complex is most stabilized in a [AsA]:[Cr(VI)] ratio of 1:2, while the Cr(V)/ascorbate/peroxo complexes reach their maximum signal intensities at [AsA]:[Cr(VI)] = 1:1. None of these Cr(V) species are stable at pH > 10, and they are reduced rapidly to Cr(III) at [AsA]:[Cr(VI)] ratios above 2:1. This is the first characterization of such Cr(V)/ascorbate/peroxo complexes. They arise from the reduction of O2 during the aerial oxidation of AsA, and their identities were confirmed by studies on the reductions of Cr(VI) with AsA in the presence of H2O2. Their presence explains the O2 sensitivity of in vitro DNA damage, and implications for Cr(VI)-induced cancers are considered. The reductions of Cr(VI) by dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) and 5,6-O-isopropylidene-l-ascorbic acid (i-p-AsA), in the presence and absence of H2O2 were also studied using EPR spectroscopy. From these studies, likely solution structures for the Cr(V) complexes formed in the reduction of Cr(VI) by AsA were assigned. "
"Resonance Raman (RR) spectra are reported for myoglobin reconstituted with seven heme isotopomers which are labeled with 15N and meso-D4 in the porphyrin skeleton or at the vinyl and propionate substituents. The RR bands are assigned to the porphyrin in-plane and out-of-plane modes as well as to the internal vibrations of substituents on the basis of the observed isotope shifts. The issue of vinyl substituent effects is revisited, and bands are assigned to the 2- or 4-vinyl group from selective deuteration shifts. Contributions of the aliphatic propionate groups are also revealed in the RR spectrum. The protein influence on the heme structure is reflected in the activation of several out-of-plane modes in the low-frequency region. "
"One-electron reduction of [Pt(bpy)2]2+ (bpy = 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridyl) in aqueous solution results in the formation of black-green lustrous needles on solid electrodes. The crystalline needles grow perpendicularly from the substrate surface and reach lengths of 1\xe2\x88\x922 cm. Elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical measurements indicate that the new compound is a genuine PtI complex with a d9 electronic configuration and with the composition [Pt(bpy)2]NO3\xc2\xb72H2O. X-ray crystallographic analysis shows that the crystalline needles consist of linear chains of discrete [PtI(bpy)2] units with a Pt\xe2\x88\x92Pt distance of 3.563(1) \xc3\x85 and with each bipyridyl ligand overlapping face-to-face (eclipsed) with its nearest neighbor. At the monomeric level, the structure of [PtI(bpy)2] units exhibits a distorted square-planar configuration with structural parameters very similar to those of the parent PtII complex, [Pt(bpy)2](NO3)2\xc2\xb7H2O. The new linear-chain compound was prepared by chemical and electrochemical methods. The resulting crystals are relatively stable in air but oxidize slowly over a period of weeks. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that the crystals are tubular with a hollow near-hexagonal morphology. Cooperative effects influence the optical and electrical properties of the crystals. Because of extensive solid-state interactions between stacked monomeric [PtI(bpy)2] units, the crystals absorb strongly over the whole visible region and far into the near infrared. Their room temperature electrical conductivity is relatively high, 10 \xce\xa9-1 cm-1. "
"The structure of four solutions containing the isolated chromochloroaquo complexes, [CrCln(H2O)6-n](3-n)+ (n = 1\xe2\x88\x923), have been investigated with the aid of EXAFS. Synthesis and isolation processes are described. In the inner-sphere complexes, Cr3+ ions are surrounded by 5H2O + 1Cl- (species [I], 1 m), 4H2O + 2Cl- (species [II], 1 and 0.005 m), and 3H2O + 3Cl- (species [III], 0.005 m), with Cr\xe2\x88\x92O and Cr\xe2\x88\x92Cl average distances of 2.00 and 2.30 \xc3\x85, respectively. In the four solutions a second coordination sphere is detected between 3.9 and 4.5 \xc3\x85. In solution containing species [I], this sphere is formed by water molecules (\xe2\x88\xbc14) at 3.97 \xc3\x85, whereas for solutions containing [II] and [III], several outer-sphere chloride anions are detected. For species [II] the second coordination sphere is formed by 3.3 (1 m) or 4.9 (0.005 m) chloride ligands, depending upon concentration of the complex, at around 4.4 \xc3\x85 and by 8.0 (1 m) or 7.2 (0.005 m) water molecules at 3.9 \xc3\x85. For species [III], where [HCl] = 12 M, this sphere is formed exclusively by seven chloride ligands at 4.3 \xc3\x85. "
"In an attempt to provide confirmation for the postulated mechanism of O2 reduction in vanadium-mediated oxidative polymerization of diphenyl disulfide, a series of divanadium complexes containing salen ligand (salen = N,N\xe2\x80\x98-ethylenebis(salicylideneamine)) were prepared, characterized, and subjected to reactivity studies toward dioxygen. A divanadium(III, IV) complex, [(salen)VOV(salen)][I3] (II), was yielded both by treatments of solutions of [(salen)VOV(salen)][BF4]2 (I) in acetonitrile with excess tetrabutylammonium iodide and by electroreduction of I followed by anion exchange with tetrabutylammonium triiodide. The complex II was characterized by a near-infrared absorption at 7.2 \xc3\x97 103 cm-1 (\xce\xb5 = 60.1 M-1 cm-1 in acetonitrile) assigned to an intervalence transfer band. A crystallographically determined V(III)\xe2\x88\x92V(IV) distance of 3.569(4) \xc3\x85 is consonant with the classification of II as a weakly coupled Type II mixed-valence vanadium (\xce\xb1 = 3.0 \xc3\x97 10-2). Oxidation of the cation [(salen)VOV(salen)]+ with O2 in dichloromethane yielded spontaneously the deep blue, mixed valent, divanadium(IV, V) species [(salen)VOVO(salen)]+ which was structurally characterized both as its triiodide (III) and perchlorate (IV) salts.

The complexes III and IV were deoxygenated in strongly acidic nonaqueous media to produce [(salen)VOV(salen)]3+ as a high-valent complex whose reversible two-electron redox couple (VOV3+/VOV+) at 0.44V vs Ag/AgCl has been confirmed. Its ability to serve as a two-electron oxidant provided a unique model of a multielectron redox cycle in oxidative polymerization. "
"A single-crystal X-ray diffraction study at 110 K and ab initio calculations up to the MP2/6-31G* level of theory showed that the ground state of P(NMe2)3 has Cs symmetry, with two different coordination geometries at the nitrogen atoms (pyramidal and planar). The calculated and experimentally determined geometries are in good agreement. Steric strain could be ruled out as the predominant factor causing the deviation from the expected C3 symmetry, because ab initio calculations on the model system P(NH2)3 (up to MP2/6-311G**) also indicate Cs symmetry for the ground-state structure, whereas calculations on N(NH2)3 have predicted this molecule to have C3 symmetry. The structure of the phosphorane H2CP(NMe2)3 has been elucidated by X-ray diffraction in the solid state (110 K) and by electron diffraction in the gas phase augmented by restraints derived from ab initio calculations up to the MP2/6-31G* level of theory. Solid-state and gas-phase structures are in good agreement showing again the Cs arrangement to be the ground-state structure of the molecule. Ab initio calculations (MP2/6-311G**) indicate that H2CP(NH2)3 also has Cs symmetry. The reasons for the preference for Cs rather than C3 symmetry adopted by the P(NR2)3 units are discussed in terms of steric repulsion, lone pair, and other electronic interactions. Literature reports of structures of derivatives containing P(NMe2)3 units are discussed in the light of the new results.

"In order to gain insight into the electrochemical and conformational properties of the prototypical high polymeric poly(ferrocenylsilane), poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) [Fe(\xce\xb7-C5H4)2SiMe2]n 6, three series of oligo(ferrocenylsilanes) R-fc-[SiMe2-fc]n-1-R\xe2\x80\x98 (fc = Fe(\xce\xb7-C5H4)2) 72\xe2\x88\x9279 (R = R\xe2\x80\x98 = H), 82\xe2\x88\x9287 (R = H and R\xe2\x80\x98 = SiMe3), and 92\xe2\x88\x9297 (R = R\xe2\x80\x98 = SiMe3) have been prepared and studied (the subscript n in the oligomer refers to the number of ferrocene units present). These species were prepared via the anionic ring-opening oligomerization of the silicon-bridged [1]ferrocenophane Fe(\xce\xb7-C5H4)2SiMe2 5. Initiation with ferrocenyllithium FcLi (Fc = Fe(\xce\xb7-C5H5)(\xce\xb7-C5H4)) followed by quenching with H2O or SiMe3Cl afforded H-fc-[SiMe2-fc]n-1-H (72-9) or H-fc-[SiMe2-fc]n-1-SiMe3 (82-7), respectively. Initiation with the dilithioferrocene complex fcLi\xc2\xb72/3TMEDA followed by quenching with H2O or SiMe3Cl similarly afforded the oligomers H-fc-[SiMe2-fc]n-1-H (72-9) or alternatively the bis(silyl)-capped species Me3Si-fc-[SiMe2-fc]n-1-SiMe3 (92-7), respectively. The individual molecular compounds of these three series of oligomers 72\xe2\x88\x9279, 82\xe2\x88\x9287, and 92\xe2\x88\x9297 were isolated in pure form from the oligomeric mixtures by column chromatography and these were structurally characterized by 1H, 13C, and 29Si NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and in selected cases by elemental analysis. The structure of the linear pentamer 75 has also been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The central portion of this species possesses a trans planar zigzag conformation in the solid state and appears to be a valuable model for the analogous conformation of the high polymer 6 in crystalline domains. The electrochemical behavior of each pure oligomer was studied by cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry and was found to depend on whether an odd or an even number of ferrocene units were present. For oligomer systems containing an odd number of iron centers two reversible redox processes of varying intensities at \xe2\x88\x920.02\xe2\x88\x920.00 V and 0.21\xe2\x88\x920.23 V (vs ferrocene) were observed with a redox splitting of 0.21\xe2\x88\x920.23 V. For oligomer systems containing an even number of iron centers larger then two, three reversible redox processes of varying intensities were observed at ca. 0.00, 0.13, and 0.24 V vs ferrocene. As the oligomer chain length increased, the electrochemical behavior for both the \xe2\x80\x9codd\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ceven\xe2\x80\x9d series approached that of the high polymer 6 for which two reversible redox processes at 0.00 and 0.24 V (vs ferrocene) of equal intensity exist. These results are completely consistent with the previously proposed theory that initial oxidation of 6 affords a product in which alternating iron sites are oxidized. Spectroelectrochemical experiments show an intervalence electron transfer absorption (1100\xe2\x88\x921350 nm, \xce\xb5max \xe2\xa9\xbd 150 M-1 cm-1) for partially oxidized oligo(ferrocenylsilanes) that is typical for class II mixed-valent compounds. Additionally, single crystals were obtained of the mixed-valent linear trimer, 732+, as an I3- salt and a single crystal X-ray diffraction study revealed the presence of terminal ferrocenium centers and a central ferrocene group consistent with the alternating iron oxidation concept.

"On the basis of the chemical principle of carbonic anhydrase (CA)\xe2\x88\x92aromatic sulfonamide inhibitor interaction, a dansylamidoethyl\xe2\x88\x92pendant cyclen (1-(2-(5-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonamido)ethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane, HL) has been synthesized as a novel type of zinc(II)\xe2\x88\x92fluorophore. The new ligand HL forms very stable complexes (ML) with zinc(II), cadmium(II), and copper(II) at physiological pH.

The fluorescent maximum and the quantum yield (\xce\xa6) of ZnL vary with the solvent:\xe2\x80\x89 at 528 nm (\xce\xa6 = 0.11) in H2O, 496 nm (0.53) in MeOH, 489 nm (0.60) in EtOH, and 484 nm (0.44) in CH3CN. Demetalation of ZnL with excess amount of EDTA yielded the metal-free ligand HL, which in pH 7.3 aqueous solution has an excitation and a weak emission fluorescence at 330 nm (\xce\xb5 4950) and 555 nm (\xce\xa6 = 0.03), respectively. The copper(II) ion, to the contrary, completely quenches the fluorescence. The crystalline copper(II) complex CuL (\xce\xbbmax 306 nm, \xce\xb5 7630 in H2O) was isolated as its monoperchlorate salt. The zinc(II)-dependent fluorescence with 5 \xce\xbcM HL at pH 7.3 is quantitatively responsive to 0.1\xe2\x88\x925 \xce\xbcM concentration of zinc(II), which is unaffected by the presence of mM concentration of biologically important metal ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. The new ligand HL forms a far more stable 1:1 zinc(II) complex than any previous zinc(II)-fluorophore and is evaluated as a new zinc(II)-fluorophore. "
"The copper(II) complexes [(Ln)Cu(NO3)4\xc2\xb72(H2O)] (n = 1:\xe2\x80\x89 1, n = 2:\xe2\x80\x89 2) of the ammonium-functionalized ligands [6,6\xe2\x80\x98-(Me2HNCH2C\xe2\x8b\xaeC)2bpy]2+ (L1) and [6,6\xe2\x80\x98-(Me3NCH2C\xe2\x8b\xaeC)2bpy]2+ (L2) were prepared. Hydrolysis of the activated phosphodiester bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP) by these complexes in ethanol\xe2\x88\x92water 19:1 at 20 \xc2\xb0C was investigated. The rate constants for cleavage of the bound phosphodiester at pH 6.6 are kcat = 4.4(\xc2\xb10.4) \xc3\x97 10-3 s-1 for (L1)Cu and kcat = 4(\xc2\xb11) \xc3\x97 10-6 s-1 for (L2)Cu. (L1)Cu accelerates hydrolysis of BNPP 4 \xc3\x97 107-fold and is 1000 times more reactive than (L2)Cu. This suggests that the high reactivity of (L1)Cu is related to the interaction of the acidic \xe2\x88\x92NMe2H+ group with the phosphodiester substrate. Bifunctional binding of a phosphate ester by metal coordination and hydrogen bonding with one ammonium group is observed in the crystallographically characterized complex [(L1)2Cu2(1,3-\xce\xbc-O3POPh)2(OH2)2](NO3)4 (3). A plausible mechanism of BNPP cleavage by (L1)Cu includes metal-hydroxide attack to the phosphodiester which is doubly activated by coordinative and hydrogen bonding. The copper(II) complex of L1 represents a simple model for the efficient cooperativity of metal ions and NH-acidic amino acid side chains (Lys-ammonium, Arg-guanidinium, His-imidazolium) in enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of phosphate di- and monoesters.

"The series of (one-electron) reductions of methylviologen (MV2+) intercalated into zeolite-Y by various carbonylmanganate donors [C+Mn(CO)4L-, L = CO, P(OPh)3] are very selective and highly dependent on the size/shape of the counterion C+, although the same electron transfers carried out (homogeneously) in solution always occur spontaneously, irregardless of C+. For example, the complete reduction of MV2+ extensively doped into zeolite-Y proceeds rapidly and quantitatively when the Na+ salts of the carbonylmanganates are employed as the reductants, but only to a very limited extent (1%) when the large PPN+ [bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium] salts of the carbonylmanganates are employed. The medium-size tetraethylammonium (TEA+) salt of Mn(CO)4P(OPh)3- slowly effects an intermediate conversion (80%). Based on the fact that the large phosphite-substituted Mn(CO)4P(OPh)3- donor cannot enter the supercage of zeolite-Y, we propose interfacial electron transfer from the carbonylmanganate to the MV2+ acceptor to occur only at the zeolite periphery. Importantly, the strong dependence of the further progress of the redox reaction with decreasing size of the cation C+ (i.e., shape selectivity) predicts that electron conduction throughout the zeolite framework requires the simultaneous transport of these cations in order to effect the complete reduction of all the encapsulated MV2+, as presented in Chart 5. "
"The addition of NO2+ to ethylene, the prototypal electrophilic nitration of a \xcf\x80 system and the focus of considerable theoretical interest as a model of aromatic nitration, has been studied in the gas phase by FT-ICR, MIKE, and CAD mass spectrometry, complemented by ab initio calculations at the MP2/6-31+G* level of theory. The results provide a clearcut answer to the principal mechanistic question addressed, showing that the reaction yields a O-nitroso product, probably CH3CHONO+, rather than a C-nitrated product. "
"Molecular simulations of the siting locations and energetics of Mo(CO)6 and C6H6 cosorbed in faujasitic zeolites NanFAU (n = 0\xe2\x88\x9296, Si/Al = 100\xe2\x88\x921) have been presented in combination with Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The in situ DRIFTS technique was found to be an efficient tool to monitor the cosorption at low coverage as well as the reaction of Mo(CO)6 and C6H6 under thermal activation within the void space of the NanFAU zeolites. The molecular simulations are based on Monte Carlo calculations using the grand Canonical ensemble and are derived from a suitable zeolite-metal carbonyl-hydrocarbon potential set. From the present experimental and theoretical results as well as earlier experiments related to the reagents sorbed alone, a coherent picture of the cosorption and chemical behavior of Mo(CO)6 and C6H6 within the void space of the faujasitic zeolites has been drawn as a function of the aluminum content. In siliceous faujasite (Si/Al = 100) the Mo(CO)6 and C6H6 molecules are randomly distributed within the void space and the molecular motions approach the rapid isotropic limits of liquids. The chemical behavior upon thermal activation is found to be analogous to that observed in solution. In Na56FAU (Si/Al = 2.5) the reagents are trapped in well-defined sorption sites in close proximity. Upon gentle thermal activation a fast reaction occurs to form Mo(CO)3(\xce\xb76-C6H6) inside the supercage through a concerted mechanism including the electrostatic field and the basicity of the framework oxygens. In Na(85-96)FAU (Si/Al = 1.25, 1) the Mo(CO)6 and C6H6 molecules are not encapsulated in close proximity. Mo(CO)6 reacts thermally in the void space like in the absence of added C6H6 to lose sequentialy three CO ligands and form predominently a Mo(CO)3(Oz)3 species in which the three vacant coordination sites are occupied by three Oz framework oxygens.

"The standard molar enthalpies of combustion, sublimation, and formation in the crystalline and gaseous state at a temperature of 298.15 K have been experimentally determined for the title compound (1) and for N-methylacetamide (2). These results have been combined with their gas-phase proton affinities to yield the standard enthalpies of formation of the species 1H+(g) and 2H+(g). These magnitudes have also been computed at the G2(MP2) level. The agreement between experimental and theoretical results is very good. This information has been used to determine the strain in the neutral and protonated \xce\xb2-lactam ring in the absence of solvent. "
"The thermal chemistry of neopentyl iodide on Ni(100) single-crystal surfaces was characterized under vacuum by using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The first decomposition step, which takes place around 150 K, is the scission of the C\xe2\x88\x92I bond, the same as in other chemisorbed alkyl halides. Owing to the absence of \xce\xb2 hydrogens, however, no easy decomposition pathway is available for the resulting neopentyl surface species. Neopentane is produced via neopentyl reductive elimination with surface hydrogen, and desorbs in two stages around 140 and 180 K. The yield for this pathway is approximately 45% of the initial neopentyl iodide at saturation (which is approximately 0.2 ML) on the clean nickel, but reaches a value close to 100% if enough hydrogen (or deuterium) is predosed on the surface. The other major carbon-containing product from neopentyl iodide activation is isobutene, which desorbs around 400 K. Isotope labeling experiments demonstrated that the C\xe2\x88\x92C bond that breaks in that reaction is the one between the \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 carbons, and highlighted the fact that the kinetics of the overall reaction displays strong isotope effects upon deuterium substitution at either the \xce\xb1 or \xce\xb3 positions. In addition, the hydrogen TPD traces indicated that one of the two hydrogens from the \xce\xb1 carbon of the neopentyl group is removed at low temperatures (below 300 K), suggesting that the precursor to isobutene formation is a neopentylidene intermediate. "
"Attempts to discover molecular chromophores with large hyperpolarizabilities have largely focused on closed-shell organic species. This contribution explores the use of sum over states (SOS) perturbation theory and the computationally efficient intermediate neglect of differential overlap (INDO) model Hamiltonian, combined with single configuration interaction (SCI) techniques, to calculate frequency-dependent quadratic molecular hyperpolarizabilities of both coordination complexes and organic radical ion chromophore aggregates having open-shell doublet ground state electronic structures. The correct evaluation of the lowest-lying excited states has been tested by comparison with experimental optical spectra. In the cases considered here, the INDO/SCI-SOS method provides both a good description of linear optical transitions and an adequate prediction of second-order nonlinearity. It is seen that the larger second-order nonlinearities of systems having open-shell electronic states, as compared to those having analogous closed-shell structures, are a consequence of accessible lower-lying charge-transfer excited electronic states. The INDO/SCI-SOS model is attractive for designing new, highly efficient open-shell second-order nonlinear optical chromophores. "
"Ab initio (MP2/6-31G*) and density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31G*) calculations were performed to check the feasibility for the fragmentation of 1,3,2-dioxasila-5-cycloheptene-2-diyl to form SiO2. According to the theoretical results the reaction is not synchronous but concerted and endergonic and requires an energy of activation of about 50\xe2\x88\x9260 kcal mol-1. Semiempirical calculations (PM3) indicate that the process should be favored as a chemical vapor deposition process at the growing surface of quartz. For the experimental realization of the fragmentation reaction the corresponding diazido silanes were chosen as silylene precursors. Two different strategies for the synthesis of 4,4\xe2\x80\x98,7,7\xe2\x80\x98-tetramethyl-2,2-diazido-1.3.2-dioxasila-5-cycloheptene are presented. Unlike the 4,7-dimethyl- and the unsubstituted system the tetramethyl derivative is stable toward polymerization. It decomposes under flash vacuum pyrolysis conditions at 650 \xc2\xb0C and can be used for the chemical vapor deposition of amorphous quartz. "
"The strength of the O\xe2\x88\x92O bond is of fundamental importance in a variety of chemical processes. Traditionally, a value of 34 kcal/mol has been ascribed to a generic O\xe2\x88\x92O bond dissociation energy. The present, high-level ab initio calculations indicate that the average O\xe2\x88\x92O bond energy is significantly higher, ca. 45 kcal/mol, and that the bond energy is sensitive to the bonding environment. Calculations at the G2 level of theory give bond dissociation enthalpies at 298 K of 50 kcal/mol for HOOH, 45 kcal/mol for CH3OOH, 39 kcal/mol for CH3OOCH3, and 48 kcal/mol for HC(O)OOH and CH3C(O)OOH. The G2(MP2) results are similar and, additionally, give bond dissociation enthalpies of 38 kcal/mol for diacetyl peroxide, 49 kcal/mol for trifluoroperoxyacetic acid, 23 kcal/mol for isopropenyl hydroperoxide, and 22 kcal/mol for peroxynitrous acid.

"Parallel X-ray absorption edge and EPR studies of the particulate methane monooxygenase in situ reveal that the enzyme contains unusually high levels of copper ions with a significant portion of the copper ions existing as Cu(I) in the \xe2\x80\x9cas-isolated\xe2\x80\x9d form (70\xe2\x88\x9280%). The observation of high levels of reduced copper in a monooxygenase is surprising considering that the natural cosubstrate of the enzyme is dioxygen. Toward clarifying the roles of the various copper ions in the enzyme, we have successfully prepared different states of the protein in the membrane-bound form at various levels of reduction using dithionite, dioxygen, and ferricyanide. EPR intensity analysis of the fully-oxidized preparations indicates that the bulk of copper ions are arranged in cluster units. The fully-reduced protein obtained by reduction by dithionite has been used to initiate the single turnover of the enzyme in the presence of dioxygen. Differential reactivity toward dioxygen was observed upon analyzing the copper reduction levels in these synchronized preparations. The enzyme is capable of supporting turnover in the absence of external electron donors in the highly reduced states. These results suggest the presence of at least two classes of copper ions in the particulate methane monooxygenase. As a working hypothesis, we have referred to these classes of copper ions as (1) the catalytic (C) clusters, which function principally as the catalytic core of the enzyme, and (2) the electron-transfer (E) clusters, which are presumed to be the source of endogenous reducing equivalents and therefore function in an electron-transfer capacity.

"From our combined experimental and computer modeling study we found a structurally and kinetically well-defined second coordination shell around chromium(III) ions in aqueous solution. Strong hydrogen binding due to polarization of first coordination sphere water molecules leads to a mean coordination number of 12.94 water molecules in the second shell and to short first shell hydrogen\xe2\x88\x92second shell oxygen distances of about 1.4 \xc3\x85. The experimentally measured exchange rate constant of = (7.8 \xc2\xb1 0.2) \xc3\x97 109 s-1 (\xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 21.3 \xc2\xb1 1.1 kJ mol-1, \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = +16.2 \xc2\xb1 3.7 J K-1 mol-1) corresponds to a lifetime of 128 ps for one water molecule in the second coordination shell and compares very well with a lifetime of 144 ps as observed from molecular dynamics simulation of a [Cr(H2O)6]3+ complex in aqueous solution. The geometry and the partial atomic charges of [Cr(H2O)6]3+ were determined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Water exchange from the second coordination shell to the bulk of the solution proceeds between a H2O sitting in the second shell and an adjacent one which just entered this shell from the bulk. By a small rotation of the first coordination shell water molecule, one of its two hydrogen bonds jumps to the entered water molecule and the one which lost its hydrogen bond leaves the second shell of the [Cr(H2O)6]3+. This associative reaction mode is a model for water exchange between water molecules which are bound by strong hydrogen bonds, as in the case for strongly polarizing 3+ ions such as Al3+ or Rh3+. Furthermore, the exchange phenomenon between second sphere and bulk water involving only two adjacent water molecules is strongly localized and independent of other water molecules of the second shell. In this respect it may be considered as a starting point for a study of water exchange on a protonated metal oxide surface. "
"We report on the transient and steady-state optical responses of the chromophore 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bithiophene-5,5\xe2\x80\x98-diylbis(phosphonic acid) (BDP) incorporated within a single zirconium-phosphonate layer as a function of chromophore density. While the dilute solution optical response of BDP reveals no anomalous behavior, its characteristics are substantially different when confined within a monolayer. We vary the concentrations of layer constituents to determine the extent of interaction between BDP moieties within a single monolayer. We observe limited initial aggregation of BDP, the extent of which is determined largely by the conditions under which the monolayer is formed. Over time, the fractional contribution of BDP aggregates to the total optical response decreases to a limiting value, implicating surface adsorption site density as the dominant factor in determining the morphology of the organobis(phosphonate) layer. Motional relaxation measurements of BDP within the layer show that the chromophores are immobile on the hundreds-of-picoseconds time scale of our experiments. "
"The continuous probability distribution (CUPID) method [D\xc5\xbeakula, \xc5\xbd.; Westler, W. M.; Edison, A. S.; Markley, J. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 6195] for conformational analysis of molecules from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data has been extended to the determination of molecular conformations of five-membered rings. This approach, which should be particularly useful for studies of molecules containing pyrrolidine or furanose rings, is illustrated by the analysis of NMR data from the literature for small peptides containing l- and d-prolines, hydroxyprolines, and fluoroprolines. The CUPID approach to the analysis of five-membered rings, which takes advantage of linear regression, generally yields better fits to experimental data in a shorter time than the conventional discrete approach, which utilizes nonlinear fitting procedures. The new method proved successful in a few cases in which the conventional approach failed to produce satisfactory analysis of the data. Built-in error-propagation analysis in the CUPID software provides a direct assessment of the reliability of the calculated results. "
"Carbon-13 NMR spectra of [cis-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)cyclopentyl]trimethylammonium iodide (4a) and triflate (4b) in acetone-d6 and in CD3NO2 show inversion of the amine with rotation about the ring\xe2\x88\x92N bond to be unusually slow with \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 (4b in acetone-d6) of 17 kcal/mol and 14 eu, similar to the values for cis-2-tert-butyl-1-(N,N-dimethylamino)cyclopentane (3) in Et2O-d10 of 16 kcal/mol and 17 eu, indicating that steric and not electrostatic interactions are responsible for the slow rates. In addition, the N+ methyls of 4a and 4b, which are magnetically nonequivalent by 13C NMR at low temperatures, undergo signal averaging with increasing temperature, the result of rotation dynamics around the ring\xe2\x88\x92N+ bonds giving for 4b in acetone-d6 \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7, respectively, of 7.2 kcal/mol and \xe2\x88\x929 eu. Similar values are found for tert-butyl rotation in 3 in Et2O-d10. Around room temperature for 4a and 4b, 1J(14N,13C) is resolved and found to be ca. 3.6 Hz. With decreasing temperature, this coupling is averaged by progressively faster 14N electric quadrupole induced relaxation. Line shape analysis of the 13C NMR spectra shows Ea for the correlation time to be 2\xe2\x88\x922.7 kcal/mol. X-ray crystallography of 4b and (cis-2-tert-butylcyclopentyl)trimethylammonium triflate (7) shows the rings to adopt the half-chair structure with vicinal substituents located at the puckered carbons. In 4b, the N+Me3 group is pseudoequatorial with the NMe2 group pseudoaxial; whereas, in 7, the tert-butyl group is pseudoequatorial with the N+Me3 group pseudoaxial. Interesting correlations are noted of 13C NMR shifts of individual methyls with their crystallographic structural assignments. "
"We have calculated the time evolution of three nonlocal contributions to the proton chemical shifts of a ribonucleic acid:\xe2\x80\x89 ring current effects, intramolecular electrostatic shifts, and electrostatic shifts due to solvent. The computation was done on a 1.075 ns molecular dynamics trajectory of a fully solvated RNA hairpin with sodium counterions. The calculated shift components exhibit rapid fluctuations on a subpicosecond time scale. The magnitudes of fluctuations are dependent on two factors:\xe2\x80\x89 the proximity of a shift source and the dynamics of the local RNA structure. The largest fluctuations were found for the shifts of exchangeable protons due to the electrostatic effects of hydrogen bond acceptors. The magnitudes of the time-averaged shifts differ significantly for the ring current and intramolecular electrostatic contributions in a structure-dependent manner. For the ribose and exchangeable aromatic protons, the major contributor to the total chemical shift is the intramolecular electrostatic effect, whereas nonexchangeable aromatic proton shifts are equally affected by ring current effects and intramolecular electrostatic shifts. Changes in the ribose sugar pucker cause large changes in the nonlocal contributions to the chemical shifts of the H2\xe2\x80\x98, H3\xe2\x80\x98, and H4\xe2\x80\x98 protons. Empirical values of local chemical shifts provided good agreement between calculated and measured shifts for the nonexchangeable aromatic protons when the solvent contributions were excluded from the calculation.

"The slow-exchange 13C spectrum of trans-cyclodecene at \xe2\x88\x92154.9 \xc2\xb0C shows eight peaks for the olefinic carbons, and these are interpreted in terms of five conformations. Three of the conformations are of C1 symmetry, and two are of C2 symmetry. Further evidence for the number of conformations and their symmetries came from a proton NMR spectrum of the olefinic hydrogens taken at \xe2\x88\x92154.9 \xc2\xb0C with decoupling the allylic hydrogens. Populations ranged from 3.0% to 37.6%, with the least-populated conformation having a free energy of 0.59 kcal/mol, relative to the most stable conformer. The conformations studied by Saunders and Jimenez-Vazquez using Allinger\'s MM3 force field are described, and the calculated strain energies and populations are discussed. Energies for six conformations were also obtained from ab initio calculations at the HF/6-311G* level. "
"The catalytic behavior of cross-linked subtilisin crystals in acetonitrile exhibits pronounced hysteresis. The transesterification activity of the crystals in anhydrous solvent varies as much as 80-fold, depending on the hydration history of the enzyme. In a comparison of drying methods, the highest rates of reaction were obtained with crystals dried by washing with organic solvent. Crystals dried over molecular sieves in air or solvent showed significantly lower activity. In all cases, full activity could be recovered in aqueous buffer. Evidence for hysteresis in hydration was obtained using a 2H-NMR method. Crystals rinsed with anhydrous solvent were found to retain approximately 70 waters per enzyme molecule more than those dried over molecular sieves. When different solvents were used to dry the enzyme crystals, the catalytic rate in anhydrous acetonitrile was found to vary significantlymethanol-washed CLEC giving the lowest rates. The transesterification activity of the solvent-washed enzyme was found to be profoundly effected by the concentration of water in the system. Optimum conditions for ester production were obtained in anhydrous acetonitrile. Under these conditions, despite a lower initial rate, absence of the hydrolysis byproduct which inhibits the enzyme led to better synthetic yields. "
"Equations permitting the application of Marcus theory to reactions with two, three, or four reaction coordinate dimensions have been derived by analogy with the one-dimensional case. All of these equations are based on the quartic approximation to the reaction coordinate; Gx = ax2 + bx3 + cx4. The final equations require as input only the energies of each corner intermediate and intrinsic barriers for each dimension. Computer programs have been written to allow finding of the transition state, by numerical search of the high dimensional hyperspace. These programs allow examination of potentially concerted reactions involving multiple processes. Numerical exploration shows that the conditions which must be met for a transition state to involve more than one reaction coordinate become increasingly stringent as the number increases, to the point that it is essentially impossible to have four coordinates changing at once. "
"The intrinsic barrier for proton transfer reactions along a preformed hydrogen bond is approximately 1 kcal/mol. The apparent intrinsic barrier for simple apparently bimolecular proton transfers is higher, typically about 5 kcal/mol, because the process involves an intervening water molecule. Analysis of this process by multidimensional Marcus theory shows that the reaction is commonly stepwise, and the apparent barrier arises from the need to form a transient unstable complex of hydronium ion and two basic species or hydroxide ion and two acidic species. A similar analysis leads to predictions of the rate constants for water mediated proton switch reactions. "
"We have investigated the effect of physical properties of 30 nonaqueous solvents on the specificity of Subtilisin Carlsberg for nucleophiles in the transesterification of N-acetyl-l-phenylalanine ethyl ester by methanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol at fixed thermodynamic water activity. In organic solvents, enzyme activity and nucleophile specificity are solvent-dependent, while in supercritical fluoroform, the activity and specificity are pressure-dependent. Losses in catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity are observed when subtilisin is exposed to hydrophilic organic solvents such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, and acetonitrile as compared to hydrophobic solvents (hexane and heptane). Log P is an important descriptor for correlating both the rate and the specificity of deacylation with solvent properties. A linear model of log initial rate against both log P and nonpolar unsaturated area provides the best two-variable fit to the data for solvents of high log P. A nonlinear model of specificity against log P provides the best fit for the complete data set. Correcting the activity for partitioning of nucleophilic substrates shows a similar trend for the intrinsic activity dependence of nucleophiles as a function of log P. In propane, under subcritical conditions, there is no significant effect of pressure on either the activity or the nucleophilic specificity of subtilisin. In fluoroform, however, where the physical properties of the solvent are pressure-dependent, the specificity of the enzyme is solvent density-dependent. "
"The influence of a bulky 5-position substituent on the amide isomer equilibrium N-terminal to proline has been explored via the synthesis and analysis of N-(acetyl)proline N\xe2\x80\x98-methylamide (1) and its respective cis- and trans-5-tert-butylproline amide diastereomers 2 and 3. The relative populations of the amide cis- and trans-isomers as well as the energy barriers for amide isomerization of 1\xe2\x88\x923 in D2O were ascertained using NMR with coalescence and magnetization transfer experiments. The relative populations of free C-terminal amide and hydrogen-bonded amide in the \xce\xb3-turn conformation were also estimated by integrating the N\xe2\x88\x92H stretch absorbances in the FT-IR spectra of 1\xe2\x88\x923 in CHCl3 and CCl4. In the prolyl peptides, the 5-tert-butyl substituent was found to exhibit profound effects on the amide isomer equilibrium, on the energy barrier for amide isomerization, and on the stability of the \xce\xb3-turn conformation. Steric interactions between the 5-position substituent and the N-acetyl group disfavor the amide trans- and augment the cis-isomer population:\xe2\x80\x89 25% in 1, 48% in 2, and 66% in 3. In the case of cis-5-tert-butylproline 2, the energy barrier for amide isomerization is observed to be 3.9 kcal/mol lower than that of 1. On the other hand, the amide isomerization barrier for trans-5-tert-butylproline 3 is similar to that for 1. Only a single amide N\xe2\x88\x92H stretch band is observed at 3454 cm-1 in the FT-IR spectrum of 3 in CHCl3 and indicates that the NH group is free of intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Hence, trans-5-tert-butylproline amide 3 does not adopt a seven-membered \xce\xb3-turn conformation, which is a favored conformer for 1 and 2 in CHCl3. Maps, in which the \xcf\x88- and \xcf\x89-dihedral angles are plotted at 30\xc2\xb0 intervals against the calculated energy of the local minimum conformation, predict qualitatively and display clearly all of the observed effects of the 5-tert-butyl substituent on the amide isomer in the N-(acetyl)proline N\xe2\x80\x98-methylamides. The results of this study suggest the use of 5-tert-butylprolines to prepare both X-Pro cis-amide isomers and twisted amide surrogates for examining prolyl residue conformations in bioactive peptides.

"The coupled oxidation of protoheme IX at the active sites of heme proteins exposed to ascorbate in the presence of dioxygen has been known for over 65 years and is related to the catalytic conversion of protoheme IX to biliverdin by the enzyme heme oxygenase. The present report demonstrates that replacement of two residues present in the distal heme pocket of horse heart myoglobin (Mb), Val67 and Val68, with alanine and serine, respectively, increases the efficiency of coupled oxidation in the active site of myoglobin. HPLC analysis of the heme oxidation product demonstrates that the specificity of wild-type myoglobin for opening the heme ring at the \xce\xb1-meso carbon is retained by the variant. The infrared spectrum of the carbonyl derivative of the variant exhibits \xce\xbdCO bands of comparable intensity at 1948 and 1958 cm-1, which are consistent with the presence of the polar serine residue in close proximity to the bound ligand. The high-resolution crystal structure of the Val67Ala/Val68Ser metMb variant establishes that a hydrogen bond forms between the hydroxyl group of Ser68 and the coordinated water molecule. The increased rate of coupled oxidation exhibited by the variant is attributed to the increased polarity of the distal pocket created by the amino acid substitutions. These results are discussed in light of recent work concerning the active site of heme oxygenase. "
"We confirm a report that 3,3-dimethyldioxetane (1a) produces 2-methyl-1,2-propanediol (5a) when heated in 1,4-cyclohexadiene as solvent. Previously, the resulting diol was taken as evidence for a stepwise, biradical mechanism in which a 1,4-dioxy biradical is trapped by the H-atom donor solvent. To investigate this possibility in more detail, the decomposition rates and product yields were measured under various conditions. We have found that the diol is not formed by trapping of the 1,4-dioxy biradical, but rather from an initial attack by the double bond of 1,4-cyclohexadiene on the strained O\xe2\x88\x92O bond of the dioxetane. Furthermore, we report that tetramethyldioxetane (1b) also produces 1.6 \xc2\xb1 1.0% of the corresponding diol, pinacol (5b), when heated in 1,4-cyclohexadiene. As the 1,4-dioxy biradical is not a likely intermediate in the thermal decomposition of dioxetanes, we support the previously proposed asynchronous, concerted mechanism for thermal decomposition of dioxetanes; the definitive evidence is formation of n\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80* versus \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80* triplets.

"The structures and stabilities of CH53+ and CH64+ and their isoelectronic boron analogues BH52+ and BH63+, respectively, were calculated at the MP2/6-31G** and QCISD (T)/6-311G** levels. The planar D5h symmetric structure 3 is a minimum for the CH53+ trication. The five hydrogens in structure 3 are bonded to the carbon atom by sharing the six valence electrons. Calculations showed that the CH64+ tetracation does not correspond to a minimum at the levels studied. The planar C2v symmetric structure 6, with two 3c\xe2\x88\x922e (three-center two-electron) bonds, on the other hand, was found to be a minimum for the BH52+ dication. The D3 symmetric structure 8 also corresponds to a stable minimum for the BH63+ trication. "
"We investigate the design of new photoprecursors of organic bases and the steric and electronic factors that control their photocleavage to give free amines. The design strategy involves the protection of an amine with novel [(benzoinyl)oxy]carbonyl groups and substituted analogs. The resulting masked amines owe their photosensitivity to the rich photochemistry of the benzoinyl chromophore. The photochemistry of this chromophore allows for the clean photogeneration of free amine upon irradiation with UV light below 400 nm in both the solid state and in solution. The structure of the benzoinyl chromophore was varied to determine the optimal chromophore design. By varying the chromophore design, the influence of various steric and electronic effects on the photoliberation of free amines from \xce\xb1-keto carbamates could be gauged. Structural modification of the aryl rings was intended to probe the electronic factors of the photocyclization. Substitution at the 2 position was varied to investigate the steric factors involved in photocyclization. The practical potential of these photoactive carbamates as organic sources of photogenerated base was demonstrated spectroscopically (UV, IR, and NMR). GC-MS product studies also proved diagnostic in identifying photogenerated base. The thermal properties of this class of base photogenerators were also determined. \xce\xb1-Keto carbamates derived from 3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-dimethoxybenzoin and its substituted analogs appear particularly attractive. These carbamates undergo near quantitative photocleavage to give free amine along with the corresponding substituted benzo[b]furan photocyclization product. Preliminary evaluation of the solid state quantum yield for cyclohexylamine photogeneration from 3,3\xe2\x80\x98,5,5\xe2\x80\x98-tetramethoxybenzoin cyclohexyl carbamate ranged from 0.03 to 0.08 depending on the exposure wavelength. The variation in photoefficiency correlates with the UV absorbance of the keto chromophore indicating direct excitation of the carbonyl group is the preferred pathway for photocleavage. "
"In calix[4]arenes when one methylene bridge carries an alkyl or aryl substituent, two diastereomeric cone conformations are possible in which this substituent assumes the equatorial or axial position. Two diastereomers with cis or trans arrangement of the substituents exist for the corresponding compounds with two substituted bridges, and diastereomeric cone conformations have to be considered additionally in most cases. Molecular mechanics calculations predict an energetical preference of the equatorial position of the substituents in both systems. This preference is markedly more pronounced for alkyl groups than for aryl groups. To test these predictions a series of calix[4]arenes in which one (4) or two opposite (5) methylene bridges are substituted by alkyl or aryl groups was synthesized by fragment condensation. For these calixarenes the solution conformations, the equatorial/axial conformational equilibria, and the energy barriers for the cone to cone ring inversion were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The experimental energy differences between the two cone conformations correlate well with the calculated ones. Free energies of activation \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 for the cone to cone ring inversion of the monoalkyl substituted compounds 4 increase in the order methyl < tert-butyl < ethyl < isopropyl. For the bisalkyl substituted compounds (5b\xe2\x88\x92d) only the cis-isomer could be isolated while cis- and trans-isomers were obtained for 5a and for the bisaryl compounds 5e\xe2\x88\x92g. Among the cis-isomers 5a\xe2\x88\x92d exist exclusively as the equatorial conformers, while the conformational equilibrium is strongly solvent dependent for 5e\xe2\x88\x92g. Single crystal X-ray structures were obtained for several calixarenes with one (4b) or two substituted bridges (5e\xe2\x88\x92g). Here the substituents are found exclusively in the equatorial position, and the molecular conformation is similar to the calculated one. "
"A series of symmetric derivatives of 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(p-(dimethylamino)styryl)-4H-pyran (DCM laser dye) has been synthesized, and the nonlinear optical properties and thermal decomposition temperatures of each of the chromophores has been measured. The symmetric chromophores all have larger hyperpolarizabilities than one would expect based on their absorption maxima. Estimations of their oscillator strengths based upon UV/vis spectra are all well above 1.0. It is proposed that these compounds possess two excited electronic states close to each other in energy, both contributing to the hyperpolarizability in an additive fashion. Electro-optical absorption spectroscopy data and semiempirical calculations on a model compound support this hypothesis. The implications of these results with regard to the tradeoff between nonlinearity and transparency are discussed. The large dipole moments and high decomposition temperatures of these chromophores make them attractive candidates for use in electro-optic polymers. "
"The plot of log kobsd vs pH for the hydrolysis of o-carboxybenzaldehyde trans-1,2-cyclohexanediyl acetal at 50 \xc2\xb0C in H2O has four unit changes of slope in the pH range 2\xe2\x88\x929. The plot is here described by proceeding from low pH to high pH. The observed hydronium ion- and water-catalyzed reactions at pH < 6 have rate constants that are similar, but not identical, to those for hydrolysis of the acylal 3-[(trans-2-hydroxycyclohexyl)oxy]phthalide, which was isolated from the reaction at pH 3, and synthesized independently. The pH\xe2\x88\x92log rate constant profile for hydrolysis of the acetal bends downward near pH 6 to give a slope of \xe2\x88\x921.0. Oxocarbonium ion hydrolysis is then a water reaction. At pH 7 the mechanism of the reaction changes to attack of OH- on the oxocarbonium ion intermediate. A change in rate-determining step takes place at pH 8 to hydronium ion-catalyzed ring opening of the anionic species of the acetal, or the kinetically equivalent intramolecular general acid catalysis in ring opening of the neutral species. The mechanism involving general acid catalysis by the neighboring carboxyl group is strongly supported by the D2O solvent isotope effect. The o-carboxyl group enhances the rate of the acetal ring-opening reaction by a factor of 220 in comparison with the exactly analogous p-carboxyl-substituted acetal. In contrast, the analogous p-OCH3-, p-NO2-, o- and p-COOCH3-, and p-COOH-substituted derivatives have uncomplicated linear pH\xe2\x88\x92log rate constant profiles with slopes of \xe2\x88\x921.0. A neighboring carboxyl group can participate in the hydrolysis of an acetal of an aliphatic alcohol if the C\xe2\x88\x92O bond breaking process is facilitated by the release of steric strain. The implications of these results for the mechanism of lysozyme-catalyzed reactions are discussed. "
"A set of supported bimetallic catalysts, designated [Re7Ir\xe2\x88\x92N], [Re7Ir\xe2\x88\x92P], [Re5IrRe2\xe2\x88\x92N], and [Re5IrRe2\xe2\x88\x92P], has been prepared from two structural isomers (1 and 2) of the cluster compound [Z]2[Re7IrC(CO)23] (Z+ = NEt4+, N(PPh3)2+) by deposition onto high surface area alumina (\xe2\x89\xa41% Re) and activation in H2 at 773 K. The specific activities of the catalysts for ethane hydrogenolysis at 500 K vary significantly (3\xe2\x88\x9263 mmol of CH4/mol of Re7Ir per s) and depend on both the metal framework structure and the counterion present in the precursor. Interpretation of EXAFS data (from both Re and Ir L3-edges) has enabled the development of specific models for the catalyst particle nanostructures that correlate with the catalytic activities. The more active catalysts ([Re7Ir\xe2\x88\x92N] and [Re5IrRe2\xe2\x88\x92N]) are modeled by a hemisphere of close-packed (hcp) metal atoms (average diameter 1 nm) with Ir at the core. On the other hand, the less active catalysts ([Re7Ir\xe2\x88\x92P] and [Re5IrRe2\xe2\x88\x92P]) are better described as two-dimensional layer structures. A combination of techniques, TPDE, IR, XANES, and EXAFS, applied under temperature-programmed conditions, has demonstrated that evolution of the final catalyst particle nanostructure depends on significant initial fragmentation of the cluster framework followed by preferential nucleation at iridium centers.

"The influence of substituents with increasing steric demands on the structure of nickel(II) 5,15-disubstituted porphyrins has been investigated with X-ray crystallography, UV\xe2\x88\x92visible absorption spectroscopy, resonance Raman spectroscopy, molecular energy optimization calculations, and INDO/s molecular orbital calculations. Nickel 5,15-diphenylporphyrin is predicted by molecular mechanics calculations to be a mixture of planar and nonplanar conformers. All of the nickel dialkylporphyrins (where the alkyl group is propyl, isopropyl, and tert-butyl) are calculated to be in a predominantly gabled (gab) conformation resulting from an \xce\xb1\xce\xb1 orientation of the substituents with respect to the macrocycle. This nonplanar gab distortion is made up of a linear combination of distortions along the lowest-frequency out-of-plane macrocycle normal coordinates of A2u (doming) and B1u (ruffling) symmetry types. A higher energy stable \xce\xb1\xce\xb2 conformer is also predicted for dialkylporphyrins, and its nonplanar structure can be represented as an equal combination of distortions along the x- and y-components of the lowest-frequency Eg (waving) normal coordinate. The nonplanar structures calculated by using molecular mechanics have been structurally decomposed into the displacements along the lowest-frequency normal coordinate of each symmetry type, and the contributions of each type to the total distortion in the calculated structures agree well with contributions obtained from structural decompositions of the available X-ray crystal structures. The predicted gab distortion is confirmed most convincingly by the X-ray crystal structure of [5,15-di-tert-butylporphinato]nickel(II) which is found to be in a gab \xce\xb1\xce\xb1 conformation. Finally, INDO/s calculations show that the red shifts in the absorption spectra of the nickel disubstituted porphyrins are caused by the increasing nonplanarity resulting from increasing steric crowding within the series.

"Crystallographic data on the [NiFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio gigas are presented that provide new information on the structure and mode of action of its dihydrogen activating metal center. Recently we found this center to contain, besides Ni, a second metal ion which was tentatively assigned to Fe (Volbeda, A.; Charon, M. H.; Piras, C.; Hatchikian, E. C.; Frey, M.; Fontecilla-Camps, J. C. Nature 1995, 373, 580\xe2\x88\x92587). This assignment is now unambiguously confirmed by a crystallographic analysis using 3 \xc3\x85 resolution X-ray data collected at wavelengths close to either side of the Fe absorption edge. Moreover, we report the structure of another crystal form of the as-purified D. gigas hydrogenase refined at 2.54 \xc3\x85 resolution, showing that the active site Fe binds three diatomic ligands. The electron density map shows an additional small peak at a position bridging the two active site metal ions, which may be assigned to some form of oxygen. This bridging oxygen species is proposed to be the signature of the inactive form of the enzyme. An infrared analysis similar to the one reported for Chromatium vinosum hydrogenase (Bagley, K. A.; Duin, E. C.; Roseboom, W.; Albracht, S. P. J.; Woodruff, W. H. Biochemistry 1995, 34, 5527\xe2\x88\x925535) shows the existence of three bands at exceptionally high frequencies, that shift their position in a concerted fashion depending on the redox state of the enzyme. Based on these high frequencies, the diatomic Fe ligands may be assigned to nonexchangeable triply bonded molecules, possible candidates being CO, CN- and NO. The frequency shifts of the infrared bands suggest a redox role for the Fe center during catalysis. Based on the new crystal structure and a number of spectroscopic results, possible modes of hydrogen binding to the active site are discussed. "
"A film of [N,N\xe2\x80\x98-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylidene)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine]manganese(III) chloride, 1, adsorbed onto an n-type CdSe single-crystal substrate acts as a stereoselective transducer for chiral analytes, coupling the complexation chemistry of the film to the band gap photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the underlying semiconductor. Exposure of the uncoated semiconductor to phenylpropylene oxide (PPO) and styrene oxide (StO) vapor results in a small PL enhancement relative to a vacuum reference level that is the same within experimental error for the four PPO and for the two StO stereoisomers. In contrast, exposure of the coated semiconductor to PPO and StO vapor substantially enhances the CdSe PL intensity relative to its intensity under vacuum conditions, and the optical response is stereoselective, with the PL enhancements and equilibrium adsorption constants dependent on the chirality of both the adsorbate and film. Use of a S,S-1 film on CdSe gives larger PL enhancements and equilibrium binding constants (estimated using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model) for S,S,-PPO, R,S-PPO, and R-StO than for the enantiomer of each of these epoxides. When the R,R-1 film is employed on CdSe, the expected enantiomeric relationship is observed, with R,R-PPO, S,R-PPO, and S-StO yielding larger PL enhancements and equilibrium binding constants. Binding constants for the preferred film\xe2\x88\x92analyte interactions are in the range of 103 to 104 atm-1. The PL enhancements can be fit to a dead-layer model, except at short wavelengths where evidence for photodissociation of the epoxide from the film is obtained, and maximum reductions in depletion width caused by epoxide\xe2\x88\x92film adduct formation are estimated to range from \xe2\x88\xbc200 to 800 \xc3\x85. The PL response can in principle serve as the basis for an on-line chemical sensor for chiral analytes. "
"The mechanisms of oxidations of amines, sulfides, and alkenes by peroxynitrous acid, as well as the mechanism for the conversion of peroxynitrous acid to nitric acid, have been investigated with density functional theory methods using the Becke3LYP functional and the 6-31G* basis set. Theoretical evidence is obtained for the mechanisms and transition states of oxidations by peroxynitrous acid both by one- and two-electron processes. Transition structures for two-electron oxidations of amines, sulfides, and alkenes are reported. An activated form of peroxynitrous acid, HOONO*, is often invoked to account for the potent oxidative chemistry of peroxynitrous acid and derivatives; a structure with the appropriate characteristics has been located. The structure of the CO2 adduct of peroxynitrite is also explored, and a mechanistic scheme is proposed for the acceleration of peroxynitrite oxidations in the presence of CO2. Energetics are described in detail for each of these species and oxidation transition structures. "
"The origin of the host\xe2\x88\x92guest interaction energy between R\xe2\x88\x92CN molecules (R = CH3, C6H5) and the basket-like cavitand (V12O32)4- has been investigated by means of ab initio Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock calculations on the model system [HCN\xe2\x8a\x82(V12O32)4-] and on the two observed complexes. The computed stabilization energies range from \xe2\x88\x9212.8 to \xe2\x88\x9214.4 kcal\xc2\xb7mol-1 for the three considered systems. Decomposition energy analysis shows that most of the stabilization should be attributed to an electrostatic origin, including direct coulombic interaction, polarization of the guest molecule and counter polarization of the vanadate host. The stabilization energy due to orbital interactions and charge transfer is increasing with the acceptor potentialities of the R substituent:\xe2\x80\x89 H < CH3 < C6H5. Mulliken population analysis indicates that two opposite charge flows should be considered for R \xe2\x89\xa0 H:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) a net donation from the cyanide \xcf\x80 orbitals to the surrounding VV d shells and (ii) a back donation from the eight oxygen atoms at the rim of the vanadate basket to the acceptor orbitals of R. Both electrostatic and charge transfer stabilization energies should therefore be attributed to the dual potentialities (acidic/basic; donor/acceptor) of the R\xe2\x88\x92CN molecules duly activated by a convenient positioning with respect to the vanadate sites with opposite properties. The complementarity of the electrostatic properties of the host and guest molecules is evidenced by the computed distributions of the electrostatic potential. The relatively acidic character of the accessible region located inside the vanadate host, as compared to the external, basic side is attributed to the topological features defining concavity. A generalization of that correlation between concavity/convexity and acidity/basicity to the class of hollow polyoxometallate clusters could provide a mechanism explaining the stabilization and the self-assembly of \xe2\x80\x9celectronically inverse\xe2\x80\x9d host\xe2\x88\x92guest systems.

"The structure of the silicate species is determined using the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock method, and the 29Si NMR magnetic shielding constants are subsequently calculated using the coupled perturbed Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock method with gauge including atomic orbitals. The silicate monomer is modeled as a neutral fully protonated species, H4SiO4 and as a monoanion\xe2\x88\x92potassium cation pair, H3SiO4-K+. Hydration by up to four and two water molecules, respectively, is also considered. For both types of environment the 29Si NMR chemical shift is within \xe2\x88\x9271.0 \xc2\xb1 0.5 ppm. The effect of symmetry and degree of condensation is studied for silicate oligomers forming chains (dimer, trimer), rings (trimer, tetramer, pentamer, hexamer), and cages (prismatic hexamer, cubic octamer, hexagonal dodecamer). Lowering the symmetry lowers the shielding. The shift of a Qn-unit depends on the adjacent bond angles: \xce\xb4TMS(Qn) = \xe2\x88\x9261.23n\xe3\x80\x88\xcf\x81(SiOSi)\xe3\x80\x89 \xe2\x88\x92 60.45 (4 \xe2\x88\x92 n)\xe3\x80\x88\xcf\x81(SiOH)\xe3\x80\x89 + 6.58, with \xcf\x81(\xce\xb1) = cos \xce\xb1/(cos \xce\xb1 \xe2\x88\x92 1). In addition the tetrahedral tetramer is studied. Previous tentative assignments of the signal at \xe2\x88\x9297.3 ppm to this species can be ruled out. It is likely to be due to one of the double-ring structures with 8, 10, or 12 tetrahedra. "
"The resting state structure of the metallocene\xe2\x88\x92alkyl cation, the coordination of the olefin to the preferred resting state structure, and the insertion process of the Ti-constrained geometry catalyst (CpSiH2NH)TiR+ have been studied with density functional theory. A combined static and dynamic approach has been utilized whereby \xe2\x80\x9cstatic\xe2\x80\x9d calculations of the stationary points on the potential surface are meshed with first principles Car\xe2\x88\x92Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations. The first molecular dynamics simulation specifically addressing the structure of a metallocene\xe2\x88\x92alkyl cation is presented showing rapid interconversion between \xce\xb3- and \xce\xb2-agostic conformations. Complementary static calculations show a small energetic preference for a \xce\xb3-agostic resting state. Coordination of the olefin to the Ti\xe2\x88\x92alkyl resting state is likely to result in the formation of a \xce\xb2-agostic \xcf\x80-complex which is highly favored energetically over other \xcf\x80-complexes that may initially form. The whole propagation cycle was studied from \xcf\x80-complex to subsequent \xcf\x80-complex. The propagation barrier corresponds to the insertion process which was calculated to have a free energy barrier of \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 24.3 kJ/mol at 300 K. The initial \xce\xb2-agostic interactions which stabilize the \xcf\x80-complex are replaced by \xce\xb1-agostic bonds which stabilize the insertion transition state. A study of the back-side insertion process reveals that it may be competitive with the front-side insertion process. "
"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor exists in different conformational states which are modulated by the binding of acetylcholine and are responsible for the regulation of ion transport across the cell membrane. How structural transitions are induced from the acetylcholine binding site to the ion channel is still a mystery. One hypothesis suggests that an invariant cysteinyl-cysteine ring in the N-terminal region of the \xce\xb1-subunit of all acetylcholine receptors may act as a molecular switch contributing to allosteric rearrangements. Since the cysteinyl-cysteine ring is a highly constrained structural element, we synthesized a peptide containing this ring, corresponding to amino acids 191 to 195 of the \xce\xb1-subunit of the receptor. This peptide (TCCPD) has four conformations, as characterized by both natural abundance 13C and proton NMR spectroscopy in aqueous solution. Both cis and trans conformations for the amide bond between the two cysteines were observed. Exchange rates between the two cis conformations and between cis and trans conformations were measured by indirectly detected 13C NMR. The \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 at 20 \xc2\xb0C was 15 and 21 kcal/mol, respectively. These barriers were within 1 kcal/mol of energy barriers calculated by molecular mechanics. Our results show the cysteine-cysteinyl ring can adopt multiple conformations and exchange between them. The eight-membered cysteinyl-cysteine may play in important role in allosteric rearrangements of the acetylcholine receptor and other proteins where this structural element is found. "
"Two silicas obtained by precipitation have been compared using two 1H NMR techniques:\xe2\x80\x89 broad-line at 4 K with simulation of the spectra and MAS at room temperature. Previous 29Si high resolution NMR results have been used to interpret the spectra. Geminal silanols, single silanols, water molecules relatively strongly hydrogen-bonded to silanols, and water not interacting with OH groups have been characterized and quantified. Differences are found between the two precipitated silicas. Silanols, 70% of which can hydrogen-bond a water molecule, occupy all the surface of one of them. The other sample surface is not so crowded with silanols, and only 37% of them hydrogen-bond water molecules. Both geminal and single silanols hydrogen-bond water. Physisorbed water molecules not interacting with silanols can be equilibrated on both sample surfaces. Room temperature dehydration of the samples in vacuum is studied. "
"The adsorbate resulting from the potentiostatic, catalytic decomposition of methanol (0.1 M CH3OH in 0.5 M H2SO4) on a platinum black electrode has been studied via 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, at open cell potential. Cyclic voltammetry results indicate that coverage is a function of electrodecomposition time and potential. The spin\xe2\x88\x92spin relaxation time T2 is dependent on surface coverage and ranges from \xe2\x88\xbc3 to \xe2\x88\xbc1.8 ms at coverages ranging from 0.3 to 0.75 ML, due to the increased effectiveness of 13C\xe2\x88\x9213C dipolar interactions at high coverage. At 0.5 ML, the temperature dependence of the 13CO T2 (in a 2H2O-exchanged electrolyte system) has been determined from 80 to 250 K. There is a well-defined peak in relaxation rate at \xe2\x88\xbc170 K which can be modeled using a simple diffusional model having an activation energy of 7.9 \xc2\xb1 2.0 kcal/mol. Spin\xe2\x88\x92lattice relaxation results from 10 to 250 K reveal Korringa behavior, with a T1T product (and Knight shift) that is independent of surface coverage, and has the same value for the electrochemical adsorbate as gas phase CO adsorbed on Pt. The similarity in T1T, T2, Knight shift, and activation energy for surface diffusion are in general accord with values previously measured in gas phase heterogeneous catalyst systems and strongly support the idea of primarily on top CO with C-down, on one major type of surface site.

"This paper describes a comparative study of self-assembled monolayers of different discoid molecules containing thioether, thiol, or disulfide substituents on gold. Discotic liquid crystalline hexaalkylthio-substituted triphenylenes and tricycloquinazolines, and derivatized triphenylenes with a single long \xcf\x89-thioalkyl or \xcf\x89-dithioalkyl substituent, are shown to self-assemble from dilute solution onto gold surfaces. Monolayers are formed owing to the known strong interaction of these functional groups with the gold. The characterization of the monolayers includes contact angle, polarized grazing incidence Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. The discotic hexaalkyl thioethers assemble essentially face-on and without detectable lateral order onto the gold substrate. The alkyl chains do not lie flat on the gold but cover the aromatic cores. In contrast, the aromatic cores of the molecules in the monolayers of the discoid monosubstituted triphenylenes with a single thiol or disulfide substituent are shown to be in edge-on orientation. Furthermore, AFM reveals lateral order in these monolayers. Ordered areas, in the form of columns of edge-on oriented molecules, extend over length scales exceeding 100 nm. Domains of different orientation can be observed. "
"Mixed aromatic\xe2\x88\x92isobutene clusters (Am.In, where A = toluene, p-xylene, mesitylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, styrene, and \xce\xb1-methylstyrene) have been ionized by resonant two-photon ionization in the vicinity of the aromatic\'s transition, and by two-photon ionization using 248 nm and 193 nm photons. Intracluster reactions leading to the formation of isobutene dimer cation C8H16\xe2\x80\xa2+ are observed following the two photon ionization of the binary clusters only when the aromatic precursor has an ionization potential greater than or equal to that of the isobutene dimer. The observation of this process in the gas phase and within clusters suggests that a similar initiation mechanism may take place in solution following the photoionization of an appropriate aromatic initiator. Evidence has been presented that points to the successive covalent additions of isobutene molecules on styrene and \xce\xb1-methylstyrene radical cations within the binary clusters. The intracluster reactions appear to yield two intermediate isomers. One isomer is consistent with an acyclic 1,4-radical cation which can initiate further polymerization via cationic or radical propagation depending on the nature of the available monomers in the cluster. The second isomer has probably a cyclic structure in which the ionic and the radical sites are interacting, and this gives rise to a stable product which manifests itself in the appearance of an enhanced ion intensity for the styrene\xe2\x88\x92isobutene or the \xce\xb1-methylstyrene\xe2\x88\x92isobutene radical cation. The effect of water on the cluster copolymerization has been examined. Intracluster proton transfer reactions within the (\xce\xb1-methylstyrene)(isobutene)(water)n species with n \xe2\x89\xa5 3 producing protonated water clusters have been observed. The results are consistent with the distonic structure of the \xce\xb1-methylstyrene\xe2\x88\x92isobutene radical cation which can initiate either cationic or radical propagation. These cluster studies present good model systems to examine the early stages of copolymerization and the reactivity ratios of different monomers. "
"Microperoxidase-8 (MP8) is the heme octapeptide derived from enzymatic proteolysis of horse-heart cytochrome c. Not only is MP8 a functional peroxidase (it catalyzes the oxidation of various substrates by hydrogen peroxide), it has also served as a useful calibration for the interpretation of the electronic spectroscopic properties of heme proteins. NMR structural characterization of MP8 has been difficult, owing to extensive aggregation at millimolar concentrations. We have obtained well-resolved 1H and 13C NMR spectra of monomeric ferric MP8-CN in mixed aqueous\xe2\x88\x92organic solvent mixtures containing excess cyanide. Most peptide resonances were assigned by through-bond correlations using TOCSY spectra; heme resonances were identified largely by through-space correlations using NOESY spectra. HMQC spectra were interpreted with the aid of proton assignments to identify 13C resonances. Most peptide resonances appear within the diamagnetic region and are very sharp, the exceptions being resonances associated with the His18 residue. Protons on the His18 imidazole ring exhibit very broad resonances, reflecting efficient relaxation. The signals of heme substituents are shifted outside of the diamagnetic envelope, with heme methyl resonances appearing between 10 and 25 ppm. The pattern of MP8-CN heme methyl resonances bears a striking resemblance to those of intact cyanoferric heme c protein derivatives. Large amide-proton/\xce\xb1-proton coupling constants and interresidue NOE contacts were found between residues 14 and 18, while moderate amide-\xce\xb1 coupling constants were found between residues 19 and 21. The imidazole group of His18 remains coordinated to the ferric center in MP8; and the pattern of heme methyl resonances confirms that a fixed axial imidazole orientation is preserved in the isolated heme active site. The observed interresidue NOE\'s and amide\xe2\x88\x92H/H\xce\xb1 proton coupling constants indicate that His18 is part of a rigid loop of five residues anchored to the heme that serves to orient the axial imidazole, while residues 19\xe2\x88\x9221 form a flexible C-terminal domain.

"Fluorescence spectroscopy is a powerful biophysical technique for studying protein structure, function, dynamics, and intermolecular interactions. Such studies are often conducted using intrinsic probes, such as tryptophan residues, or extrinsic probes introduced by post-translational modification, such as dansyl. Specificity, however, is often a concern since many proteins contain more than one tryptophan and chemical modification often will occur at more than one site. Herein we report the in vitro, site-specific incorporation of three fluorescent amino acid analogues, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 7-azatryptophan, and \xce\xb5-dansyllysine, each of which was incorporated into \xce\xb2-galactosidase at a single designated site.

"The synthesis and metal ion responsive properties of two 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridyl-phenylene-vinylene-based polymers is reported. These polymers are designed to be partially conjugated in their metal-free state and fully conjugated when exposed to metal ions so that the ion-induced conjugation enhancement can be transduced into a measurable signal. It is found that these polymers exhibit highly ionochromic effects with a wide variety of transition and main group metal ions excluding metal ions of the alkali and alkaline earth groups. For instance, both absorption and fluorescence emission bands of the polymers upon exposure to metal ions can be red-shifted up to 120 nm, depending on the metal ions present and the polymers used.

Diastereoselective and enantioselective hydrogenation of the racemic \xce\xb2-keto ester 5 to give the enantiomerically pure (96% ee) ester 8 is reported. The conversion of the derived vinylstannane 11 to the antibiotic marine alkaloid (\xe2\x88\x92)-haliclonadiamine (1) is described. 
"The transition state for NAD+ (oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) hydrolysis by the cholera toxin A1 polypeptide (CTA) has been characterized by multiple V/K kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) using labeled NAD+ as the substrate. CTA causes cholera by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of the signal-transducing Gs\xce\xb1 protein. In vitro, CTA catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of several simple guanidino compounds as well as the slow hydrolysis of NAD+ (kcat = 8 min-1, Km = 14 mM) to form ADP\xe2\x88\x92ribose and nicotinamide. KIEs for NAD+ hydrolysis are the following:\xe2\x80\x89 primary 14C = 1.030 \xc2\xb1 0.005, primary 15N = 1.029 \xc2\xb1 0.004, \xce\xb1-secondary 3H = 1.186 \xc2\xb1 0.004, \xce\xb2-secondary 3H = 1.108 \xc2\xb1 0.004, \xce\xb3-secondary 3H = 0.986 \xc2\xb1 0.003, \xce\xb4-secondary 3H = 1.020 \xc2\xb1 0.003, and primary double = 1.052 \xc2\xb1 0.004. On the basis of steady-state kinetic parameters for CTA-catalyzed NAD+ hydrolysis, as well as a comparison with KIEs measured for NAD+ solvolysis, the enzymatic KIEs are near-intrinsic and describe a transition state that is relatively desolvated at the reaction center. The inability of CTA to catalyze NAD+ methanolysis is also consistent with desolvation at the reaction center. Together with the observation that CTA catalyzes ADP-ribosylation with inversion of configuration at the anomeric carbon (Oppenheimer, N. J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978, 253, 4907\xe2\x88\x924910), NAD+ hydrolysis by CTA is best described by a concerted displacement mechanism involving an enzyme-directed water nucleophile. The small, inverse solvent deuterium KIE demonstrates that a rate-limiting proton transfer does not characterize the CTA reaction coordinate. Using bond-energy bond-order vibrational analysis, the KIEs for NAD+ hydrolysis by CTA have been used to model a transition state geometry. The model is consistent with a highly dissociative, concerted mechanism, characterized by distances from the anomeric carbon to the leaving group and incoming nucleophile of approximately 2.2 and 3.3 \xc3\x85, respectively. There is significant oxocarbonium ion character and hyperconjugation within the ribose ring. The \xce\xb3- and \xce\xb4-secondary KIEs are evidence for enzyme\xe2\x88\x92substrate interactions that are remote from the reaction center and are unique to enzymatic stabilization of the transition state.

"The X-ray crystal structure of inactivated carboxypeptidase A by (2R,3S)-2-benzyl-3,4-epoxybutanoic acid, a pseudomechanism-based inactivator, was determined to show that the carboxylate of Glu-270 at the active site of the enzyme is covalently modified:\xe2\x80\x89 the inhibitor is tethered to the carboxylate forming an ester linkage which is brought about by the attack of the carboxylate on the oxirane ring of the inhibitor. Examination of the crystal structure in comparison with that inactivated by its enantiomer, (2S,3R)-2-benzyl-3,4-epoxybutanoic acid, shows that the two inhibitors are bound covalently to the enzyme in a symmetrical fashion. An explanation for the lack of inactivating activity found previously with (2R,3R)- as well as (2S,3S)-2-benzyl-3,4-epoxybutanoic acids was offered. "
"This work is a theoretical analysis in four stages of association between the blue copper protein plastocyanin and the heme protein cytochrome f, which are physiological partners in the photosynthetic electron-transfer chain. In the first stage, 32\xe2\x80\x89000 trajectories of approach by plastocyanin to cytochrome f were generated with implicit consideration of hydration and with gradual cooling of the system from 300 to 0 K. Approximately 2000 trajectories resulted in local minima of energy, i.e., in docking. The molecular configurations having relatively low energies were grouped, by structural similarity, into six families. In the second stage, six configurations having the lowest energies, one from each family, were subjected to thorough molecular dynamics simulation, for 260 ps. Extensive hydration of the proteins was treated explicitly. The whole plastocyanin molecule and the relevant parts of the cytochrome f molecule were given conformational freedom. In the third stage, the following three contributions to the energy of binding were calculated:\xe2\x80\x89 polarization of water by the proteins, determined from numerical solutions of the Poisson\xe2\x88\x92Boltzmann equation; nonelectrostatic (van der Waals and other) interactions involving the proteins and water; and the Coulombic interactions within and between the protein molecules. Total energy of association was calculated with a thermodynamic cycle; several realistic sets of parameters gave consistent results. The configuration having the most favorable Coulombic interactions turned out to have the second highest total energy. This finding exemplifies the importance of allowing for hydration and for conformational flexibility in docking calculations and perils of neglecting these factors. In the fourth stage, electronic coupling between the copper and heme sites in the six configurations was analyzed and compared by the Pathways method. The configuration providing the most efficient path for electron tunneling turned out to be different from the most stable configuration. There are indications that the evident interaction between Lys65 in cytochrome f and Tyr83 in plastocyanin may involve the ammonium group of the former and the aromatic ring of the latter. These surprisingly strong noncovalent interactions, so-called charge-\xcf\x80 interactions, have recently been discovered and are important for molecular recognition. Modeling and structural optimization of these interactions are beyond the state of the art in molecular mechanics, but these studies should become possible with improved force fields. The electron-transfer reaction between cupriplastocyanin and ferrocytochrome f is fast in the noncovalent complex and undetectably slow in the covalent complex. This contrast is explained in terms of our theoretical analysis. "
"The solid-state shape, size, and intermolecular packing of a fifth-generation dendritic macromolecule were determined by a combination of site-specific stable-isotope-labeling, rotational-echo double-resonance (REDOR) NMR and distance-constrained molecular dynamics simulations. REDOR experiments measured dipolar couplings between 13C atoms located near the chain ends and an 19F label placed at the core of benzyl ether dendrimers (generations 1\xe2\x88\x925) based on 3,5-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol as the monomeric repeat unit. Intramolecular 13C\xe2\x88\x9219F coupling was distinguished from intermolecular coupling by dilution with nonlabeled dendrimer. The average intramolecular 13C\xe2\x88\x9219F distances for generations 3\xe2\x88\x925 were each approximately 12 \xc3\x85, which indicates inward-folding of chain ends with increasing generation number. The average intermolecular 13C\xe2\x88\x9219F dipolar coupling decreased with increasing generation number, consistent with decreased interpenetration for larger dendrimers. The measured intra- and intermolecular distances for the fifth-generation dendrimer were used as constraints on energy minimizations and molecular dynamics simulations, which resulted in visualizations of the dendrimer packing and an estimate of density in the solid state.

"A sequence of ordered solvent peaks in the electron density map of the minor groove region of ApT-rich tracts of the double helix is a characteristic of B-form DNA well established from crystallography. This feature, termed the \xe2\x80\x9cspine of hydration\xe2\x80\x9d, has been discussed as a stabilizing feature of B-DNA, the structure of which is known to be sensitive to environmental effects. Nanosecond-range molecular dynamics simulations on the DNA duplex of sequence d(CGCGAATTCGCG) have been carried out, including explicit consideration of \xe2\x88\xbc4000 water molecules and 22 Na+ counterions, and based on the new AMBER 4.1 force field with the particle mesh Ewald summation used in the treatment of long-range interactions. The calculations support a dynamical model of B-DNA closer to the B form than any previously reported. Analysis of the dynamical structure of the solvent revealed that, in over half of the trajectory, a Na+ ion is found in the minor groove localized at the ApT step. This position, termed herein the \xe2\x80\x9cApT pocket\xe2\x80\x9d, was noted previously (Lavery, R.; Pullman, B. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1985, 5, 1021) to be of uniquely low negative electrostatic potential relative to other positions of the groove, a result supported by the location of a Na+ ion in the crystal structure of the dApU miniduplex [Seeman, N.; et al. J. Mol. Biol. 1976, 104, 109) and by additional calculations described herein based on continuum electrostatics. The Na+ ion in the ApT pocket interacts favorably with the thymine O2 atom on opposite strands of the duplex and is well articulated with the water molecules which constitute the remainder of the minor groove spine. This result indicates that counterions may intrude on the minor groove spine of hydration on B-form DNA and subsequently influence the environmental structure and thermodynamics in a sequence-dependent manner. The observed narrowing of the minor groove in the AATT region of the d(CGCGAATTCGCG) structure may be due to direct binding effects and also to indirect modulation of the electrostatic repulsions that occur when a counterion resides in the minor groove \xe2\x80\x9cAT pocket\xe2\x80\x9d. The idea of localized complexation of otherwise mobile counterions in electronegative pockets in the grooves of DNA helices introduces a heretofore mostly unappreciated source of sequence-dependent effects on local conformational, helicoidal, and morphological structure and may have important implications in understanding the functional energetics and specificity of the interactions of DNA and RNA with regulatory proteins, pharmaceutical agents, and other ligands.

"Enzyme structure and function have been studied for subtilisin BPN\xe2\x80\x98 solubilized in organic solvents by ion pairing with low concentrations of an anionic surfactant (Aerosol OT) in the absence of reversed micelles. Soluble subtilisin shows strikingly different behavior in octane and tetrahydrofuran (THF). In octane, the kcat/Km for the transesterification of N-acetyl-l-phenylalanine ethyl ester (APEE) is 370 M-1 s-1, within one order of magnitude of the enzyme\'s hydrolytic activity in water. Moreover, the observed half-life of the soluble enzyme in octane is nearly three orders of magnitude greater than in water, presumably because of the absence of autolysis in the organic solvent. In contrast, the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme dissolved in the polar solvent THF is 0.04 M-1 s-1, and the enzyme loses 99% of its activity within 10 min. Comparable enzyme inactivation could also be observed in octane, but only at elevated temperatures such as 70 \xc2\xb0C. Therefore, the mechanisms of deactivation of the soluble enzyme were investigated in both octane and THF. Kinetic and spectroscopic (CD and EPR) studies support the existence of multiple inactive forms of the soluble enzyme in THF at 25 \xc2\xb0C and in octane at 70 \xc2\xb0C. Notably, in both cases a denatured form can be renatured in anhydrous octane at 25 \xc2\xb0C, the first demonstration of enzyme renaturation in a bulk organic solvent. A model explaining the THF- and thermally-induced inactivation processes of soluble subtilisin BPN\xe2\x80\x98 is proposed, and the apparent reasons for the exceptionally high activity and stability of the soluble enzyme in octane are discussed.

"Experimental details are given for the preparation of \xe2\x80\x9csoftballs\xe2\x80\x9d, large self-complementary molecules capable of assembly into pseudo-spherical capsules. Evidence is presented for their existence as hydrogen bonded dimers in organic solvents, and binding affinities for the reversible encapsulation of smaller molecules of suitable size and shape are given. Studies at various temperatures result in calculated enthalpies and entropies of encapsulation that are positive; accordingly, the process is entropy driven. It is proposed that the hosts in their resting states contain two molecules of solvent such as benzene, and the encapsulation of a single large guest\xe2\x88\x92the hostage\xe2\x88\x92liberates the two solvents. The resulting increase in the number of free molecules gives rise to the increase in entropy observed for the exchange process. Experiments involving solvent mixtures are consistent with this rationale. Calculation of the capsule\'s interior volume and molecular dynamics simulations support the experimental observations, and hint at unexpected phenomena dealing with the occupancy factors of these systems. "
"A symmetry analysis based upon the structure of simple molecules and their anticipated intermolecular interactions can lead to successful predictions of molecular packing and crystal symmetry. As a demonstration of these ideas an in-depth study of the oxalamide functionality as a persistent hydrogen bonding unit is presented. The synthesis and structural characterization of a series oxalamide dicarboxylic acids is presented and the structures compared with the analogous urea compounds. Both the urea and oxalamide dicarboxylic acids form designed two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded \xce\xb2-networks with a significant degree of reliability. The urea designs are quite reliable when there is a molecular 2-fold axis, but competing hydrogen bond patterns are found when less symmetrical molecules are studied. The oxalamide design based on inversion centers is also quite reliable, with the designed layer structure found in most cases. "
"Photolysis of dibenzothiophene sulfoxide results in the formation of dibenzothiophene and oxidized solvent. Though quantum yields are low, chemical yields of the sulfide are quite high. Yields of the oxidized solvents can also be high. Typical products are phenol from benzene, cyclohexanol, and cyclohexene from cyclohexane and 2-cyclohexenol and epoxycyclohexane from cyclohexene. A number of experiments designed to elucidate the mechanism of the hydroxylation were carried out, including measurements of quantum yields as a function of concentration, solvent, quenchers, and excitation wavelength. These data are inconsistent with a mechanism involving a sulfoxide dimer, which also does not properly account for the solvent oxidations. It is suggested that the active oxidizing agent may be atomic oxygen O(3P) or a closely related noncovalent complex, based on the nature of the oxidation chemistry, comparison to known rate constants for O(3P) reactivity, and the quantum yield data.

"The absolute configuration of curacin A was determined as (2R,13R,19R,21S)-1 by comparison of degradation products 2 and 3 with the same materials prepared by asymmetric synthesis. The total synthesis of 1 was completed from (1R,2S)-2-methylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid (8) and the amino alcohol derivative 46. The latter was prepared from 4-pentynal (14) and the Garner aldehyde (43). Asymmetric allylation of 14 followed by methylation of the derived alcohol 16 gave 17, which was subjected to zirconation\xe2\x88\x92iodination to yield 18. The latter was coupled to the vinyl boronate 21, prepared from 4-pentynyl acetate (20), in the presence of Pd(0), and the resultant trienol 22 was converted to phosphonium iodide 24. Wittig reaction of the ylide from 24 with 43 afforded tetraene 44 which produced 45 upon methanolysis. The mesylate 46 was advanced to thioester 48 either by direct coupling with potassium thiolate 47 obtained from (\xe2\x88\x92)-8 or indirectly via 49. The amino thioester liberated from 48 underwent thermal cyclization to give (+)-curacin A. "
"Anhydrous 1-methylhexamethylenetetramine (also referred to as N-methylurotropinium or methylhexaminium) fluoride was prepared by either halogen exchange between the corresponding iodide and AgF or by a single-step, one-pot, self-assembling synthesis from aqueous CH3NH2, HF, formaldehyde, and NH3. It was characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy. Its hydrate undergoes at 70 \xc2\xb0C a Sommelet-type ring opening and coupling reaction to form a potential cryptand system consisting of two bicyclic triazine groups that are connected through a methylene bridge and contain eight ternary nitrogen atoms. The compound was characterized by multinuclear NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, and its structure was determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. "
"The sign of the 1Lb Cotton effects (CEs) of the benzene chromophore from about 240 to 270 nm in the circular dichroism (CD) of enantiomers of ring-substituted chiral benzylcarbinamines and benzylcarbinamine salts are correlated with their absolute configurations using the benzene sector rule and a consideration of the equilibrium between their two conformers of lowest energy and of oppositely signed rotatory power. These CEs are the result of vibronic borrowing from allowed transitions of the benzene chromophore at shorter wavelength, but an induced rotatory contribution, the sign of which may be predicted using the benzene chirality rule, is small compared to the vibronic contribution and need not be considered when predicting the sign of the 1Lb CEs.

"(+)-Crotanecine (1) is the necine base component of a number of pyrrolizidine alkaloids. This necine subunit is an amino triol bearing a primary allylic alcohol characterized by an all-cis relationship of its stereocenters. The synthesis of (+)-crotanecine has been accomplished in 10 steps and 10.2% overall yield. The key step in the asymmetric synthesis is a Lewis acid-promoted, tandem inter[4 + 2]/intra[3 + 2] cycloaddition between a (fumaroyloxy)nitroalkene 14 and chiral \xce\xb2-silylvinyl ether (\xe2\x88\x92)-26. This synthesis serves to illustrate the synthetic versatility of the tandem cycloaddition to incorporate additional functionality. "
"Quenching of the luminescent excited state of Eu3+ ions by C\xe2\x88\x92H high-vibrational modes was studied by deuteration of the encapsulating ligand and the solvent. Novel polydentate hemispherands providing nine donor atoms, which form overall neutral complexes with rare earth ions, were synthesized in nine steps, allowing the easy incorporation of deuterium atoms (11a\xe2\x88\x92d\xc2\xb7Eu3+). The introduction of tert-butyl groups at the aromatic rings of the ligand further increased the solubility of the complexes in organic solvents (29\xc2\xb7Eu3+ and 34\xc2\xb7Eu3+). Photophysical studies, viz., luminescence spectra and lifetime measurements, revealed that significant quenching of the Eu3+ excited state is induced by nearby C\xe2\x88\x92H vibrational modes. Substitution of these quenching C\xe2\x88\x92H modes for C\xe2\x88\x92D bonds in the azacrown bridge leads to an enhancement of the luminescent lifetime by a factor of 1.5. C\xe2\x88\x92H high-vibrational modes of the pendant arms which are at a larger distance to the Eu3+ ion than the azacrown bridge hydrogen atoms (determined from the MD calculations) are less efficient quenchers. The number of coordinating methanol molecules to 11a\xc2\xb7Eu3+, 29\xc2\xb7Eu3+, and 34\xc2\xb7Eu3+ estimated by the \xe2\x80\x9cHorrocks equation\xe2\x80\x9d is 0.9, 1.2, and 1.9, respectively, as was predicted by MD calculations. Moreover, the experimental data show that quenching of the excited state of well-shielded Eu3+ ions by the C\xe2\x88\x92H modes of the ligand is of the same order of magnitude as quenching by one O\xe2\x88\x92H mode.

"Diiron(II) complexes with an oxygen-rich coordination environment were assembled with the dinucleating dicarboxylate ligands m-xylylenediamine bis(Kemp\'s triacid)imide (H2XDK) and the more soluble analogue m-xylylenediamine bis(propyl Kemp\'s triacid)imide (H2PXDK). X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that, in most of the complexes, only one monodentate N-donor ligand is bound to each iron(II) ion. In addition to XDK and PXDK, a variety of other ligands bridge the dimetallic core including chloride, fluoride, triflate, or carboxylate. The tris(carboxylate-bridged) complexes [Fe2(\xce\xbc-XDK)(\xce\xbc-O2CPh)(ImH)2(O2CPh)(MeOH)] (3) and [Fe2(\xce\xbc-O2CC(CH3)3)(\xce\xbc-PXDK)(N-MeIm)2(O2CC(CH3)3)] (4) have the same ligand composition as the diiron(II) cores in the hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase (MMO) and in the R2 protein of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). The coordination environments of the two iron centers in 3 and 4 are inequivalent, with one iron being 6-coordinate and the other being 4-coordinate. The bridging benzoate and pivalate ligands have an unusual coordination mode with a Fe\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92C bond angle close to 180\xc2\xb0. Fits of magnetic susceptibility data collected for several of the complexes between 300 and 4 K indicated that the two iron(II) centers are weakly antiferromagnetically coupled with a coupling constant which does not depend on the nature of the bridging ligands. M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectra of polycrystalline and frozen THF solution samples of 4 exhibited two overlapping doublets of equal intensity, reflecting the different coordination environments of the two iron(II) ions. The nearly identical M\xc3\xb6ssbauer parameters for the solid and frozen solution samples indicate that the dinuclear core remains intact upon dissolution. Stopped-flow studies of the reaction of 3 and 4 with O2 in THF showed the rapid formation (k\xcf\x88 \xe2\x89\x88 74 s-1 for 3 at 202.5 K and k\xcf\x88 \xe2\x89\x88 300 s-1 for 4 at 197 K) of colored intermediates with broad absorption maxima near 660 and 670 nm, respectively. These values are characteristic of peroxo-to-iron charge-transfer bands and similar to that observed for the (\xce\xbc-peroxo)diiron(III) intermediate (Hperoxo) in the MMO reaction cycle. "
"The small electron transporting copper protein, azurin, has been studied in order to investigate the interplay between the oxidation states of the metal and its coordination geometry. The results show that the metal coordination geometry for Ag(I) in Ag(I) substituted wild type azurin is only slightly different from the geometry for Cd(II) in cadmium substituted azurin both being similar to the geometry for copper in native azurin. Furthermore, the coordination geometry for Ag(I) in the Met121 to Leu substituted mutant of azurin is also similar to the geometry of copper in native azurin. In contrast, previously published results show that Cd(II) substituted Met121Leu-azurin exhibits two different coordination geometries for Cd(II), one again similar to the wild type geometry and another very flexible and distinctly different from wild type azurin. These results have been obtained by Perturbed Angular Correlation of \xce\xb3-rays spectroscopy using the two radioactive isotopes 111Ag(I) and 111mCd(II) as probes of a monovalent and a divalent ion, respectively. The technique also revealed that the metal-coordination geometry for Ag(I) in wild type azurin relaxes to the coordination geometry of Cd(II) on a time scale of 100 ns after the decay from 111Ag(I) to 111Cd(II). We suggest that the role of Met121 is to maintain the rigid tricoordinated metal coordination geometry independent of the oxidation state of the metal. "
"ZnS thin films are made by laser driven chemical vapor deposition (CVD) from a single-source precursor, Zn(S2COCHMe2)2 under vacuum conditions. Photofragments in the gas phase are identified simultaneously by luminescence spectroscopy. The laser selectively activates the initial decomposition of the precursor and drives its conversion to the desired materials under mild conditions. These photolytically produced films are compared to films made by thermal deposition from the same precursor. The deposits from both techniques, characterized by X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, are pure stoichiometric ZnS in the hexagonal phase. Surface morphology differs in shape and granule size. During the laser-driven CVD process, gas-phase photochemical intermediates are identified by luminescence spectroscopy. The luminescent photoproducts are Zn and S2, the two elemental components of the final material. Photofragmentation mechanisms leading to ZnS, the luminescent species Zn and S2, and the gaseous organic byproducts are discussed. Further characterization of the photofragmentation pathways is provided by the trapping of the photoreaction products and by mass spectroscopy. "
"The results presented in this paper show that accurate through-space internuclear distance measurements can be performed on doubly labeled retinals using the one-dimensional approach to the solid state magic angle spinning (MAS) rotational resonance NMR technique. The apparent splitting \xce\x94\xcf\x891 of the resonances at n = 1 rotational resonance for the labeled vinylic positions of (all-E)-[10,20-13C2]retinal, (all-E)-[11,20-13C2]retinal, and (all-E)-[12,20-13C2]retinal can be simulated with a coherent set of parameters. From a series of simulations with different dipolar coupling constant bIS, it appears that bIS/2\xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x9a8 = 1.15(\xce\x94\xcf\x891/2\xcf\x80) + 7 (Hz) to a good approximation. Using this relationship as a calibration, it is demonstrated with a set of model compounds that straightforward Lorentzian fitting to measure \xce\x94\xcf\x891 can be used to determine internuclear distances up to 0.44 nm in doubly labeled retinals in the solid state.

"A series of linear peptides designed to fold into different \xce\xb2-hairpin conformations in aqueous solution has been studied by 1H NMR with the aim of understanding the role played by the turn residue sequence in defining \xce\xb2-hairpin structure. The designed peptides differ only in the amino acid sequence of the putative turn region and have identical strand residues. Our results clearly demonstrate that the turn residue sequence determines the turn conformation and, thereby, other features of the \xce\xb2-hairpin conformation, such as the pattern of interstrand residue pairing and the type of hydrogen-bonding register between \xce\xb2-strand backbone atoms. Furthermore, two key structural factors responsible for the stability of different types of turns were identified. Thus, a side-chain\xe2\x88\x92side-chain interaction between Asn at position i and Thr at position i + 4 stabilizes five-residue turns, whereas a four-residue turn is stabilized when the first residue of the turn has high tendency to populate the \xce\xb1R region of the Ramachandran map. Our results highlight the relevance of turn structures in the early events of protein folding. "
"The photochemistry, photophysics, and solid-state 13C CPMAS NMR of benzophenone and cyclohexane in the zeolite NaX have been analyzed to investigate their proximity, relative mobility, and intermolecular reactivity. Photochemical irradiation of benzophenone in pure cyclohexane yields benzopinacol and benzhydrol as the predominant products. In contrast, irradiation in the solid state leads to 1-cyclohexyl-1,1-diphenylmethanol as the only product by collapse of the radical pair formed after hydrogen abstraction from cyclohexane by excited benzophenone. Phosphorescence analysis at 77 K suggests a highly polar environment, but lack of emission at 300 K in the presence of cyclohexane is assigned to triplet decay via an efficient hydrogen abstraction reaction. Spectral analysis by 13C CPMAS NMR reveals that benzophenone and cyclohexane are adsorbed in an approximate 1:2 ratio. Changes observed in spinning and static samples before and after photolysis are interpreted in terms of molecular motions that are capable of affecting the spectral line width. That benzophenone and cyclohexane share the zeolite supercages in a close packed arrangement was shown by a relatively efficient 1H\xe2\x88\x9213C intermolecular cross polarization from cyclohexane to benzophenone-d10. Comparison of the CPMAS intensities measured with deuterated and nondeuterated benzophenone samples under identical conditions suggest that intermolecular C\xe2\x88\x92D\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7H\xe2\x88\x92R distances between carbon atoms of deuterated benzophenone and hydrogens of cyclohexane have an average value of ca. 2.2 \xc3\x85.

"Here we contrast the stability of monomeric and photopolymerized self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) containing a diacetylene group (HS(CH2)10C\xe2\x8b\xaeCC\xe2\x8b\xaeC(CH2)10COOH) with SAMs prepared from simple n-alkanethiols. The polymerized SAMs are extremely durable compared to either the n-alkanethiol SAMs or the unpolymerized diacetylenic SAMs. For example, they are stable to repeated electrochemical cycling to extreme potentials, thermal excursions to 200 \xc2\xb0C, and exposure to hot base (1:1 mixture of ethanol and 1.0 M aqueous KOH at 100 \xc2\xb0C). All of these conditions completely strip n-alkanethiol SAMs from Au substrates. These high-performance materials are suitable for applications in lubrication, adhesion, corrosion passivation, and chemical sensing. "
"Electron spectroscopic and diffraction results obtained in ultra-high-vacuum, combined with cyclic voltammetric data, are reported for sulfur adlayers deposited from aqueous sulfide and bisulfide media on Pt(111). The highest coverage obtained by Auger electron spectroscopy, 0.94 \xc2\xb1 0.05 monolayer, is very close to the coverage obtained from coulometry, and is associated with a (1\xc3\x971) surface phase. This coverage is much higher than that obtained in previous electrochemical studies but is the same as found by other investigators using S2 beam dosing in vacuum. The near complete sulfur monolayer is characterized by a rapid and incomplete oxidation in a narrow potential range near 0.70 V vs a Ag/AgCl reference. Neither full sulfur monolayer coverage nor a sharp voltammetric transition could be obtained when traces of oxygen were present in the electrochemical cell. Oxidation of the (1\xc3\x971) adlayer (at \xe2\x89\x881 monolayer) gave rise to a previously unreported (2\xc3\x972) structure, at 1/2 monolayer. Further voltammetric stripping resulted in two more adlattices:\xe2\x80\x89 (\xe2\x88\x9a3\xc3\x97\xe2\x88\x9a3)R30\xc2\xb0 at 1/3 monolayer and p(2\xc3\x972) at 1/4 monolayer, as reported in previous gas phase studies. The selective stripping procedure provides unique electrochemical control at room temperature of surface structure and coverage, without any change in the long-range surface order of the substrate. When dosing was carried out from bisulfide solution, a (\xe2\x88\x9a3\xc3\x97\xe2\x88\x9a7) phase at 3/5 monolayer was formed, which once again was not reported previously. The results of the core-level electron energy loss spectroscopy studies suggest that sulfur adatoms retain some of the negative charge and that this charge plays a major role in controlling hydrogen adsorption coverage in the presence of coadsorbed sulfur on Pt(111).

"Electrochemical reduction of a wide variety of aromatic diazonium salts on carbon electrodes (glassy carbon, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite) leads to the covalent attachment of the corresponding aromatic radicals. The films thus deposited on glassy carbon surfaces require mechanical abrasion to be removed. Cyclic voltammetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, polarization modulation IR reflection absorption spectroscopy, Auger spectroscopy, and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy allow the characterization of the overlayer and an estimate of the surface coverage. The latter can be controlled through diazonium concentration and electrolysis duration. The mechanism of derivatization is discussed on the basis of the kinetic data obtained from cyclic voltammetry and preparative electrolysis. This versatile method of surface modification may find applications in the field of carbon\xe2\x88\x92epoxy composites as attested by the successful binding of grafted p-aminophenyl groups with epichlorhydrin.

"High-level ab initio computations were used to characterize the parent species and \xce\xb1C radicals for alanine, serine, and threonine, both as free neutral amino acids (AH) and as residues in model peptides (PH) intended to mimic the midchain environment in proteins. The ab initio energies were used in isodesmic reactions to predict bond dissociation energies (BDEs, D\xce\xb1CH) at 298 K, in kJ mol-1, to an estimated accuracy of \xc2\xb110 kJ mol-1. For the fully optimized systems the values of D\xce\xb1CH are AH(Gly), 331; AH(Ala), 317; AH(Ser), 327; AH(Thr), 328; PH(Gly), 348; PH(Ala), 344; PH(Ser), 348; PH(Thr), 356. All of the D\xce\xb1CH values are less than the BDE of a typical SH bond (370 kJ mol-1), as in cysteine or glutathione (GSH), a result that suggests that oxidative damage at the \xce\xb1C site will not be repaired efficiently by the mechanism of H donation from GSH. Values of D\xce\xb1CH in typical peptide conformations, such as \xce\xb2-sheet and \xce\xb1-helical secondary structure, were estimated by constraining the Ramachandran dihedral angles, \xce\xa6 and \xce\xa8, to values typical of these structures. Thus D\xce\xb1CH values are estimated as PH(Gly), 361; PH(Ala), 359; PH(Ser), 347; PH(Thr), 356 in the \xce\xb2-sheet conformation, and PH(Gly), 402; PH(Ala), 384; PH(Ser), 381; PH(Thr), 363 in the \xce\xb1-helix conformation. Hence, these residues are also expected to be susceptible to irreparable oxidative damage in \xce\xb2-sheet structures, but Gly, Ala, and Ser residues in \xce\xb1-helical regions should be less susceptible to damage and should be repairable by GSH. A consideration of reduction potentials calculated from the BDEs and entropies derived from the ab initio results leads to the same conclusions and indicates that certain radicals other than OH\xe2\x80\xa2 that occur in cells (e.g., ROO\xe2\x80\xa2) may also cause oxidative damage to \xce\xb2-sheet structures. Ab initio calculations were also done for the C-centered radicals formed by removal of H from the side chains. These showed that there is a marked increase in the ease of abstraction of this H in the series Ala, Ser, and Thr. "
"The electronic spectrum of the blue copper protein plastocyanin has been studied by ab initio multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory (the CASPT2 method). The six lowest electronic transitions have been calculated and assigned with an error of less than 2000 cm-1. The singly occupied orbital in the ground state is Cu 3d\xe2\x88\x92SCys 3p\xcf\x80 antibonding with some NHis 2p\xcf\x83 character. The bright blue color originates from an electron transfer to this orbital from the corresponding Cu 3d\xe2\x88\x92SCys 3p\xcf\x80 bonding orbital. The influence of different ligand models on the spectrum has been thoroughly studied; Cu(imidazole)2(SCH3)(S(CH3)2)+ as a model of CuHis2CysMet is the smallest system that gives converged results. The spectrum is surprisingly sensitive to changes in the geometry, especially in the Cu\xe2\x88\x92S bond distances; a 5 pm change in the Cu\xe2\x88\x92SCys bond length may change the excitation energies by as much as 2000 cm-1. The effect of the surrounding protein and solvent on the transition energies has been modeled by point charges and is found to be significant for some of the transitions (up to 2000 cm-1). "
"The correlation between hydrogen/deuterium \xce\xb1-secondary kinetic isotope effects and transition state looseness has been investigated by MP2/6-31++G(d,p) calculations on three identity X- + CH3X SN2 reactions. By varying the C\xe2\x88\x92X distances in these systems it is shown that the secondary kinetic isotope effect increases with increasing transition structure looseness. Furthermore, it is shown that looseness is best defined as a \xce\x94-elongation of the C\xe2\x88\x92X bond lengths, where the reference state can be either the isolated reactants or the ion\xe2\x88\x92dipole complex. The variation of kinetic isotope effects is shown by factor analysis to be determined by C\xe2\x88\x92H bending vibrations. The contributions from C\xe2\x88\x92H stretching vibrations are important for the absolute values of the kinetic isotope effects, and are partly due to C\xe2\x88\x92H bond length changes. The variation of the secondary kinetic isotope effect from the stretching vibrations with looseness is in the opposite direction as the bending contribution, causing a level-off in the total kinetic isotope effect for tight transition structures. "
Alkanoic acids adsorb weakly to the native oxide surface of aluminum. Treating the oxide surface first with an alkoxide of zirconium provides for strong subsequent adsorption of the alkanoic acid. The formation of an interfacial zirconium carboxylate gives rise to this strong adhesion. A combination of quartz crystal microbalance and ultrahigh-vacuum IR spectroscopic techniques were used to establish the stoichiometry and structural features of the interfacial zirconium carboxylate film. 
"Benzopyridoindole and benzopyridoquinoxaline derivatives were conjugated to a 14-mer oligonucleotide at either of two different positions:\xe2\x80\x89 the 5\xe2\x80\x98 end or an internucleotide position in the center of the 14-mer. These oligonucleotide\xe2\x88\x92intercalator conjugates were then tested for their ability to form stable DNA triple helices with a DNA target duplex under physiological conditions. All of the derivatives synthesized were found to do so. Two derivatives in particular, a benzo[h]pyridoquinoxaline (B[h]PQ) attached to the 5\xe2\x80\x98 end and a benzo[e]pyridoindole (B[e]PI) attached to the internal position on the phosphate diester backbone, dramatically stabilized the triple helix under physiological conditions. In the absence of spermine, the melting temperature of the triplex-to-duplex transition increased from 11 \xc2\xb0C for a non-modified triplex to 38 and 37 \xc2\xb0C, respectively, for the B[h]PQ and B[e]PI conjugates. Acridine-oligonucleotide conjugates were much less stable, melting at 25 \xc2\xb0C (5\xe2\x80\x98 attachment) and at 23 \xc2\xb0C (internucleotide linkage). In the presence of spermine, the melting temperature increased from 28 \xc2\xb0C for a non-modified triplex to 51 and 54 \xc2\xb0C for the B[h]PQ and B[e]PI conjugates, respectively, equivalent to a stabilization of \xe2\x88\xbc4 kcal\xc2\xb7mol-1 at 37 \xc2\xb0C. Furthermore, the conjugation of these intercalators to the third strand was not detrimental to the selectivity of recognition of the target duplex sequence. Molecular modeling reinforced and provided possible models for some of the intercalator\xe2\x88\x92triple helix interactions investigated. These results demonstrate the possibility for forming stable DNA triple helices at physiological pH and temperature. "
"Cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) binds cytochrome c (Cc) at two distinct surface binding domains, one having high affinity for Cc and the other having low affinity. The identity of the surface binding domains on CcP has been probed by studying photoinduced interprotein heme\xe2\x88\x92heme electron transfer (ET) between Zn-substituted horse Cc, ZnCc, and a cloned cytochrome c peroxidase, CcP(D37K). Charge-reversal substitution of the negatively-charged residue Asp 37 of CcP by a positively-charged residue lysine greatly decreases the stoichiometric constant for 1:1 binding of Cc, from 8.5 \xc3\x97 105 M-1 for the wild-type CcP to 1.2 \xc3\x97 104 M-1 for CcP(D37K) (\xce\xbc = 18 mM), thereby identifying residue 37 as part of the high-affinity binding domain of CcP(WT) (domain 1). This assignment is consistent with domain 1 as being that observed in a crystal of the Cc\xe2\x88\x92CcP complex. The diminished ability of CcP(D37K) to bind Cc at domain 1 also suppresses binding of a second Cc molecule to form a ternary complex. However, the mutation sharply increases the reactivity of CcP:\xe2\x80\x89 the stoichiometric rate constant for heme\xe2\x88\x92heme ET within the 1:1 3ZnCc\xe2\x88\x92Fe3+CcP(D37K) complex is 4000 s-1, much higher than that (40 s-1) for ZnCc(H)\xe2\x88\x92Fe3+CcP(WT). These results are explained by two-domain binding, where the high-affinity domain 1 has low heme\xe2\x88\x92heme ET reactivity, while domain 2 has high heme\xe2\x88\x92heme ET reactivity. The CcP(D37K) mutant exhibits greater reactivity than CcP(WT) because the mutational weakening of Cc-binding at CcP domain 1 increases the fraction of 1:1 complex where Cc is bound at the heme-reactive domain 2. Upon changing the ionic strength from 18 to 59 mN, the stoichiometric ET rate constant increases for the Cc\xe2\x88\x92CcP(WT) complex, whereas it decreases 4-fold for the Cc(H)\xe2\x88\x92CcP(D37K) complex, which indicates that the two distinct binding domains on CcP are differentially affected by ionic strength. This overall picture of ET between these two proteins is supported by a careful reconsideration of the most recent work from other laboratories. We hypothesize that domain 1 may make the dominant contribution to the direct reduction of the Trp 191 radical, while domain 2 provides the dominant kinetic site for ferryl\xe2\x88\x92heme reduction.

"Further investigation of the monoclonal antibody 16G3 has revealed that it not only couples activated amino acids to form dipeptides with high turnover rates but also couples an activated amino acid with a dipeptide to form a tripeptide, as well as an activated dipeptide with another dipeptide to give a tetrapeptide. The catalytic rates for these reactions greatly exceed the background rate of ester hydrolysis providing average yields of 80% within the assay time of 20 min. Importantly, the amount of product inhibition is low, allowing for high yields of products using multiple addition of substrates to the same antibody reaction mixture. A sequential mechanism is employed by 16G3 for dipeptide coupling, and this mechanism appears to hold for the formation of the other peptides. High catalytic selectivity is observed for the nucleophilic \xce\xb1-amino group of an \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-diamino nucleophile and for the para substituent on the activated ester, traits that are consistent with hapten design. The former chemoselectivity is crucial for the condensation of fragments which are unprotected at the \xce\xb5-amino group of lysine. "
"A molecular clip is described which binds aromatic guests by an induced fit mechanism. It contains twelve long aliphatic chains and can evoke liquid-crystalline properties in a variety of molecules, including polymers and porphyrins, by a process of molecular recognition. "
"The self-reproduction of vesicles formed by (S)- and (R)-2-methyldodecanoic acid (4) was investigated in order to relate the autocatalytic increase of the vesicle concentration with enantioselectivity. 4(R) and 4(S) were synthesized with an enantiomeric excess greater than 98%. 4 forms vesicles in aqueous solution in the pH region between 8.8 and 7.5. Chiral properties of the vesicles were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD). For self-reproduction studies, the hydrolysis of the water-insoluble 2-methyldodecanoic anhydride (8) was investigated in a biphasic system consisting of an aqueous solution and 8. The reaction rates of 8(RR) and 8(SS) catalyzed by 4(R) or 4(S) vesicles were the same within experimental errors, indicating that the chiral vesicles cannot induce significant enantioselectivity. However, a clear effect was observed at 10 \xc2\xb0C:\xe2\x80\x89 racemic vesicles destabilized during hydrolysis, causing phase separation, whereas homochiral vesicles remained stable and continued to self-reproduce.

"A synthetic approachnamely slippageto self-assembling [n]rotaxanes incorporating \xcf\x80-electron deficient bipyridinium-based dumbbell-shaped components and \xcf\x80-electron-rich hydroquinone- and/or dioxynaphthalene-based macrocyclic polyether components has been developed. The kinetics of rotaxane formation by the slipping procedure were investigated by absorption UV\xe2\x88\x92visible and 1H-NMR spectroscopies in a range of temperatures and solvents, varying systematically the size of both the stoppers and the macrocyclic components. As expected, the rate constants for these processes are affected by the size complementarity between macrocycles and stoppers. Furthermore, the enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energies of activation associated with the slippage and the effect of solvent polarity upon the outcome of these processes have been evaluated. In addition, the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of some of the rotaxanes are presented and discussed with reference to the properties of their chromophoric and electroactive units. "
"Full details of an enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-duocarmycin A (1) are described in which a solution to the control of the relative and absolute stereochemistry of the remote stereocenters is provided. Catalytic asymmetric dihydroxylation of 15 was employed to introduce the absolute stereochemistry required for the activated cyclopropane, and a diastereoselective Dieckmann-type condensation of 61 was employed to control the absolute stereochemistry of the C6 quaternary center. The complementary diastereoselectivity of a thermodynamic versus kinetic condensation of 61 permitted the divergent synthesis of (+)-duocarmycin A or epi-(+)-duocarmycin A from common intermediates. Final introduction of the reactive cyclopropane was accomplished by transannular spirocyclization of the mesylate 44 upon treatment with base or directly from the corresponding free alcohol itself, duocarmycin D1 (42), upon Mitsunobu activation. Notably, the asymmetric dihydroxylation of 15 employing (DHQD)2-PHAL/(DHQ)2-PHAL was found to proceed with a reverse enantioselectivity than predicted from established models. Employing this approach, the key partial structures (+)-N-BOC-DA (67) and (+)-6-epi-N-BOC-DA (71) and their unnatural enantiomers were also prepared, and a study of their acid-catalyzed solvolysis reactivity, regioselectivity (3:2), and stereochemistry is detailed. Notably, the solvolysis reaction regioselectivity is lower than the characteristic adenine N3 alkylation of duplex DNA, which proceeds with exclusive nucleophilic addition to the least substituted C8 cyclopropane carbon. This may be attributed to the significant destabilizing torsional strain and steric interactions characteristic of the SN2 reaction of a large nucleophile that accompany the abnormal addition of adenine when restricted to the minor groove bound orientation of the reactants.

"The molecular and crystal structure and electron density distribution were studied for a single crystal of pentaethyl-1,5-dicarba-closo-pentaborane C2B3(Et)5 by the high-resolution X-ray diffraction method at 120 K (5696 observed reflections, R = 0.056). The single crystal was grown by in situ crystallization with an IR-laser beam producing a molten zone in a Lindeman capillary. In crystal the molecule of the title compound has local C1-symmetry with different orientations of the Et-groups with respect to the central trigonal-bipyramidal C2B3 fragment, mean B\xe2\x88\x92C and B\xe2\x88\x92B distances are 1.571 and 1.876 \xc3\x85, respectively, the axial C...C distance is 2.277 \xc3\x85. An ab initio calculations of the molecular structure indicated that rotation barriers of the Et groups with respect to the central frame are very small, that may be the reason of the low molecular symmetry and diffrerent orientation of the Et groups in molecule due to the crystal packing effects. Deformation electron density (DED) maps obtained via a conventional \xe2\x80\x9cX\xe2\x88\x92X\xe2\x80\x9d method, and using a multipole refinement procedure, showed charge accumulation in the B\xe2\x88\x92C bonds of the central frame, and these bonds were found to be essentially bent outward of the C2B3 cage. On the contrary, no charge accumulation was detected in the B\xe2\x88\x92B bonds, thus indicating the absence of the direct B\xe2\x88\x92B interactions. Positive and delocalized DED was also found in all B\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92B triangle faces of the central cage, that indicates the contribution of the multicenter bonding in the electronic structure of this formally electron-precise molecule. Topological analysis of the experimental charge density distribution has been performed including an analysis of the Laplacian maps, and these data confirmed all important features of the DED maps.

"Stopped-flow kinetic studies of the reactions of [Fe2(BIPhMe)2(O2CH)4] (1a), where BIPhMe = 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bis(1-methylimidazolyl)phenylmethoxymethane, and [Fe2(OH)(Me3TACN)2(OAc)2]+ (2a), where TACN = 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, with O2 are presented. In CHCl3, both reactions are first-order in [O2] and second-order in diiron(II) complex concentration. Mechanisms consistent with the kinetic data are proposed. The main feature of these schemes is a bimolecular pathway involving a tetranuclear (\xce\xbc4-peroxo)diiron(II)diiron(III) species in the transition state. Evidence for carboxylate shifts in the oxidation mechanisms is presented, offering one possible way in which this class of structural equilibria might control the chemistry at related non-heme diiron centers in metalloproteins.

"General synthetic routes to zirconium metallocene-like complexes containing derivatives of the dianionic trimethylenemethane (TMM) ligand are presented. One approach consists of reacting the dilithium salts of TMM, tribenzylidenemethane (TBM), tert-butyltribenzylidenemethane (t-Bu-TBM), and dibenzylidenemethylenemethane (DBM) with either Cp*ZrCl3 or CpZrCl3(DME). In the case of the small TMM fragment, the product is the zwitterionic Cp*(TMM)Zr(\xce\xbc-Cl)2Li(TMEDA) (1). Larger TMM derivatives give discrete salts such as [Cp*(TBM)ZrCl2][Li(TMEDA)2] (2), [Cp(TBM)ZrCl2][Li(TMEDA)2] (3), [Cp(t-Bu-TBM)ZrCl2][Li(TMEDA)2] (4), [Cp*(t-Bu-TBM)ZrCl2][Li(TMEDA)2] (5), and [Cp*(exo-endo-DBM)ZrCl2][Li(TMEDA)2] (6). The reaction of TBM(LiTMEDA)2 with Cp*ZrCl2CH2Ph affords [Cp*(TBM)ZrCl(CH2Ph)][Li(TMEDA)2] (9); thus the retention of LiCl(TMEDA)2 by zirconium is strong. Structural characterization of these complexes reveals crowded environments around the zirconium, especially when both TBM and Cp* are coordinated. It is also possible to take advantage of intramolecular \xcf\x83-bond metathesis reactions to convert coordinated allyl ligands to TMM-related fragments. For example, [Cp*(TMM)Zr]2(\xce\xbc-CH2) (10) is derived from Cp*(\xce\xb73-CH2C(Me)CH2)ZrMe2, and Cp*(TBM)ZrMe(THF) (12) is from Cp*(PhCH2C(CHPh)2)ZrMe2 (11). Formation of the methylpropargyl complex Cp*(TBM)Zr(\xce\xb73-CH2CCMe) (13) from Cp*(TBM)ZrMe(THF) and 2-butyne instead of a butenyl derivative is a consequence of steric constraints. Activation of 2\xe2\x88\x926 with methylaluminoxane affords homogeneous catalyst mixtures for polymerization of ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene and copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene. There is a strong correlation between catalyst precursor structure and reactivity. Polyethylene can also be prepared by pressurizing a vessel containing only Cp*(TBM)ZrMe(THF). "
"We have employed Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry to investigate and quantify the recognition of chiral amines in the gas phase by the chiral crown ethers (R,R)- and (S,S)-dimethyldiketopyridino-18-crown-6, using a new procedure wherein the relatively involatile chiral ligand is easily ionized via electrospray to produce a protonated host molecule. A neutral chiral amine and an achiral reference amine, which are generally fairly volatile, were introduced into the ion trapping cell, where they reacted with the protonated host to form crown\xe2\x88\x92ammonium complexes. Equilibrium constants were determined for exchange of the chiral and achiral amine guests. Electrospray of the other enantiomeric host, followed by guest exchange equilibrium constant determination, enabled characterization of the effects of chirality on complexation equilibria. Comparison of the equilibrium constants for the two enantiomeric hosts measures the relative degree of recognition for a given guest. In all cases, binding of the guest with absolute configuration opposite those of the host stereocenters is preferred. The free energy of binding the preferred enantiomer of \xce\xb1(1-naphthyl)ethylamine is 3.5 \xc2\xb1 0.6 kJ mol-1 greater than for the nonpreferred enantiomer, in agreement with results obtained using an older ligand transfer method. Enantiomeric preferences (all in kJ mol-1) for sec-butylamine (0.3 \xc2\xb1 0.4), cyclohexylethylamine (0.9 \xc2\xb1 0.2), and methylbenzylamine (2.4 \xc2\xb1 0.5) illustrate intrinsic factors contributing to chiral recognition, including steric bulk and the importance of \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 stacking interactions to anchor the guest. The interactions of sec-butylamine and cyclohexylethylamine can be described using a three-point binding model, while the aromatic amines are more consistent with the four-point binding model described by Cram. The data suggest that recognition in this system arises largely from differing degrees of methyl rotor locking for the two enantiomers, with accompanying differences in the entropy of complexation.

"The transformation of a rhodium(I) \xce\xb72-alkyne model complex RhCl(PH3)2(HC\xe2\x8b\xaeCH) (A) into the vinylidene form RhCl(PH3)2(CCH2) (E) has been examined by ab initio theoretical calculations using MP2 level geometry optimizations and localized molecular orbital (LMO) analysis. The vinylidene form E has been found to be 7.8 kcal/mol more stable than A. The previously found intraligand 1,2-hydrogen shift mechanism in the Ru(II)-coordinated alkyne\xe2\x88\x92vinylidene isomerization is not relevant for the present Rh system. The reaction proceeds via the oxidative addition product RhCl(PH3)2(H)(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCH) (C), followed by a bimolecular hydrogen shift from the metal to the terminal carbon of a second molecule rather than by intramolecular 1,3-hydrogen transfer. The LMO analysis of the transition state of the unimolecular 1,3-hydrogen shift indicates that the hydrogen moves as a proton while it interacts with the three centers simultaneously, i.e., Rh, C\xce\xb1, and C\xce\xb2 in the transition state. The hydrogen was analyzed to migrate also as a proton in the bimolecular mechanism. The barrier of the bimolecular pathway has been further calculated for a more realistic system with substituted phosphines, RhCl(PiPr3)2(H)(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCH), using the integrated MO + MM (MP2:MM3) method. It was concluded that in the real system with substituents on both the phosphines and the alkyne, RhCl(PiPr3)2(HC\xe2\x8b\xaeCR), the bimolecular hydrogen shift is still favored by ca. 15 kcal/mol in free energy of activation; unimolecular 1,3-H migration should become important in special cases like solid state isomerizations. "
"The mechanism of diimine\xe2\x88\x92Ni-catalyzed ethylene polymerization reaction has been studied theoretically using the B3LYP density functional method. The chain initiation reaction proceeds with the coordination of ethylene to the model active catalyst [L2NiCH3]+, L2 = (HNCH)2, followed by ethylene insertion into the metal\xe2\x88\x92alkyl bond with a rate-determining 11.7 kcal/mol free energy barrier to form a \xce\xb3-agostic intermediate, which with a small barrier rearranges to a more stable \xce\xb2-agostic intermediate and then forms an olefin alkyl complex upon coordination of the next ethylene. Linear polymer propagation takes place from this olefin alkyl complex, the resting state in the catalytic cycle, via the same insertion, rearrangement, and coordination pathway. An alternative pathway from the olefin alkyl complex passes over a 14\xe2\x88\x9215 kcal/mol barrier for \xce\xb2-hydride elimination and reinsertion for branched polymer propagation. These energetics suggest that the Ni(II)-catalyzed reaction is expected to produce more linear than methyl-branched polymers, and that higher temperature increases and higher ethylene pressure decreases the branching. Hydrogenolysis is an energetically favorable termination pathway, proceeding via coordination of a hydrogen molecule to the metal center, followed by H\xe2\x88\x92H activation through a four-centered \xe2\x80\x9cmetathesis-like\xe2\x80\x9d transition state and reductive elimination of alkane. A comparison with zirconocene-catalyzed ethylene polymerization shows that the Ni(II)-catalyzed polymerization should be slightly slower and should give more branching. "
"The diferrous oxidation level of carboxylate-bridged non-heme diiron proteins is pivotal because only it reacts directly with dioxygen. In this state each ferrous ion has ST = 2. Such integer-spin, so-called \xe2\x80\x9cNon-Kramers\xe2\x80\x9d (NK) systems typically are difficult to access by paramagnetic resonance techniques, and this property has precluded the application of ENDOR and ESEEM spectroscopies to this state. Integer-spin systems frequently exhibit a ground state \xe2\x80\x9cNon-Kramers doublet\xe2\x80\x9d, however, which is split in zero applied field by an energy within the microwave range, thus rendering the center EPR active. Recently, we showed that ENDOR and ESEEM spectroscopies also can be applied to NK doublets, in preliminary measurements on diferrous methane monoxygenase hydroxylases (MMOHred) Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b and azido-hemerythrin (N3Hrred) (Hoffman, B. M.; Sturgeon, B. E.; Doan, P. E.; DeRose, V. J.; Liu, K. E.; Lippard, S. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994, 116, 6023\xe2\x88\x926024). Building on this study plus subsequent theoretical work (Hoffman, B. M. J. Phys. Chem. 1994, 98, 11657\xe2\x88\x9211665), we now present a comparative 3-pulse ESEEM study of the diiron(II) centers of the two MMOHred, N3Hrred, N3Ribonucleotide reductase (N3R2red), N3Rubrerythrin (N3Rrred), and N3-\xe2\x80\x9cChopped\xe2\x80\x9d Rubrerythrin (N3CRrred), which lacks the 39-residue C-terminal FeS4 domain. This report first presents the theory necessary for quantitative interpretations of the frequency-domain (ENDOR-like) spectra obtained by three-pulsed ESEEM measurements performed in the limit where the external magnetic field (Bo) oriented parallel to the microwave field is small:\xe2\x80\x89 Bo \xe2\x89\xb2 20 G. It then presents experimental NK-ESEEM results for 14N nuclei from coordinated histidine of each of the five diferrous proteins and from azide of the three azido-proteins. The measurements yield 14N quadrupole tensors to high precision as well as estimates of hyperfine couplings. In addition they provide otherwise unavailable information about the orientations of the tetragonal crystal fields of the individual ferrous ions. The data suggest that the histidyl ligands to the cluster play a major role in determining the electronic structure of the functionally important diferrous state of these proteins. They disclose a surprising reorientation of azide in the Rrred pocket upon deletion of the C-terminal domain. "
"The soluble methane monooxygenase system (MMO), consisting of a hydroxylase (MMOH), a reductase, and component B (MMOB), catalyzes the NADH and O2 dependent hydroxylation of methane and many other hydrocarbons. The binuclear non-heme ferrous active site cluster of the hydroxylase\xe2\x88\x92component B (MMOH\xe2\x88\x92MMOB) complex in the presence of substrate and small molecules has been studied using circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopies. CD studies reveal that addition of the alternative substrate, trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, or inhibitor, tetrachloroethylene, induces a conformational change in the active site pocket only in the presence of MMOB. Complementary MCD data indicate that this conformational change does not result in a direct change in the ligation of the iron atoms. Comparison of the CD/MCD data with the crystal structure of MMOH allows a tentative correlation between the perturbations observed and the iron atoms affected. The binding of MMOB to MMOH distorts the ligand field environment of one iron, while substrate binding in the presence of MMOB perturbs the other, therefore providing insight into the regulatory role of MMOB and into the participation of the two iron centers in the reaction. Anion binding to the MMOH\xe2\x88\x92MMOB complex was also investigated. No spectral perturbation by small molecules (KB < 30 M-1) in reduced MMOH and the MMOH\xe2\x88\x92MMOB complex was observed, suggesting that the hydroxylase active site pocket is less electrophilic than other binuclear non-heme iron proteins, consistent with its role in charge donation to activate dioxygen.

"We report the principal components of the 13C chemical shift tensors for seven acylium ions, determined by both slow speed magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and theoretical methods. Experimentally, the acylium ions were prepared either by direct reaction of the parent acyl halides with metal halide powders, including frozen antimony pentafluoride, or by the reaction of alkyl halides with carbon monoxide on aluminum chloride (AlCl3). The generalization of our recent observation of the acetylium ion on AlCl3 to other cations is direct proof of free acylium ion intermediates in Friedel\xe2\x88\x92Crafts acylation reactions. 13C CP MAS NMR spectra of the acylium ions were acquired at temperatures ranging from 83 to 298 K, and the principal components of the 13C chemical shift tensors were extracted by fitting the side band intensities of the MAS spectra. With the exception of the chloroacetylium ion, the acylium ions studied have isotropic 13C1 chemical shifts of 154 \xc2\xb1 1 ppm, but clear variations in the principal components of the shift tensors were measured. The carbenium carbons of the acetylium and 2,2-dimethylpropionylium ions have axially symmetric 13C chemical shift tensors, consistent with the molecular symmetry (C3v), while the chemical shift tensors of the other cations were characterized by non-zero asymmetry parameters. The observation of appreciably smaller chemical shift anisotropies for C1 in the benzoylium ions versus the values for the corresponding carbon in the alkanoyl cations is consistent with charge delocalization into the ring substituent. Additional information on the acylium cations is provided by theoretical calculations. We optimized the geometries of the acylium ions using second-order M\xc3\xb8ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and the 6-311G* basis set. We then calculated the NMR data at the MP2 level using the gauge-including atomic orbital (GIAO) method and the double-\xce\xb6 (dz) and triple-\xce\xb6 polarized (tzp) basis sets of Horn and Ahlrichs. While the isotropic shifts calculated at the GIAO-RHF/tzp/dz level were in error by as much as 26 ppm, the GIAO-MP2 values were in excellent agreement with the experimental measurements, as were those for most of the principal components. The calculations were also used to determine the orientations of the principal components. The results of analysis of the MP2 wave functions help answer long standing questions regarding the structure and bonding of acylium cations. "
"The benzenium, toluenium, and ethylbenzenium ions were synthesized on aluminum bromide by coadsorption of the precursors with either HBr or alkyl bromide. Principal components of the 13C chemical shift tensors for the ring carbons of these species were measured from magic angle spinning spectra. The benzenium ion was static at 77 K but underwent both proton scrambling and anisotropic rotation at 298 K as well as oligomerization at higher loadings. The para form of the toluenium ion was the dominant isomer at 77 K, but a temperature-dependent equilibrium between the para and ortho isomers was observed at 273 K. Observations of 1H\xe2\x88\x9213C self-decoupling and loading-dependent 13C shifts for small amounts of toluene on high-purity AlBr3 demonstrate the existence of trace Br\xc3\xb8nsted sites on an important Friedel\xe2\x88\x92Crafts catalyst. Geometries of the benzenium ions were optimized with both MP2/6-311+G* and density functional calculations at B3LYP/6-311+G*; these were in very good agreement with one another. Energy calculations at MP4(fc,sdq)/6-311+G*//MP2/6-311+G* with thermal corrections resulted in good agreement between calculated and measured proton affinities for benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene. For the toluenium ion, the energies of the ortho and meta isomers were 1.2 and 5.4 kcal/mol, respectively, above the para isomer, consistent with the temperature-dependent 13C NMR spectra in the solid state. 13C chemical shift tensors calculated at the GIAO-MP2/tzp/dz//MP2/6-311+G* and GIAO-MP2/tzp/dz//B3LYP/6-311+G* levels of theory were in very close agreement with each other and generally in satisfactory agreement with experimental principal components. The calculated tensors of benzenium ion were modified to account for the two dynamical processes described above, and a combination of these reproduced the experimental observation of a single, axially symmetric tensor at 298 K.

"Low-frequency (50\xe2\x88\x92425-cm-1), near-infrared-excitation resonance Raman (RR) spectra are reported for bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides in which the bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) and bacteriopheophytin (BPh) cofactors are labeled with 15N or 26Mg. The focus of the study is the identification of the very low-frequency modes of the dimer of BChls (P) which are strongly coupled to the P* electronic transition which initiates the primary charge separation process in RCs. In order to gain a complete picture of the vibrational characteristics, the low-frequency RR spectra of the accessory BChls and the BPhs were examined in addition to those of P. The RR spectra of the isotopically labeled cofactors in the RCs were compared with one another and with the spectra obtained for solid-film samples of isolated, isotopically labeled BChl and BPh. Based on these comparisons and the predictions of semiempirical normal coordinate calculations, a self-consistent set of assignments has been developed for all the RR active modes of the different BChl and BPh cofactors in the RC which are observed in the very low-frequency regime (50\xe2\x88\x92250 cm-1). The assignments indicate that the strongly coupled, low-frequency modes of P all involve either deformations localized on pyrrole ring I or the macrocycle core. The so-called \xe2\x80\x9cmarker mode\xe2\x80\x9d of P, observed near 135 cm-1, is due to a cluster of three modes, specifically, the in-plane deformation of the C2-acetyl group (130 cm-1), the doming motion of the Mg(II) ion (137 cm-1), and a core deformation that involves all four pyrrole rings (143 cm-1). The calculations further suggest that the very strongly coupled mode observed near 35 cm-1 is due to the out-of-plane deformation of the C2-acetyl group. The strong coupling of these modes is consistent with the structure of the dimer in which overlap occurs primarily in the region of ring I. This geometrical arrangement of the cofactors also places the C2-acetyl substituents of one constituent of P in close proximity to the core of the macrocycle of the other. The unique interplay between the structural, electronic, and vibronic characteristics of the primary electron donor suggests that the strong coupling of certain vibrations is an intrinsic consequence of the structure of the dimer and may have important functional ramifications.

"A method for constraining short peptides (<20 residues) of arbitrary sequence to an \xce\xb1-helical conformation (\xe2\x88\xbc100% helical in H2O at 25 \xc2\xb0C) is presented. Glutamine residues at positions i and i + 7 of the peptides were tethered with an alkanediyl chain between the side chain nitrogen atoms. Peptides containing this tether were readily synthesized on the solid phase by amide formation between an \xce\xb1,\xcf\x89-diaminoalkane and the side chain carboxylates of glutamate residues. The resulting cyclic peptides were studied by NMR and CD and were found to adopt an \xce\xb1-helical conformation in aqueous solution. The \xce\xb1-helix was thermally stable to \xe2\x89\xa540 \xc2\xb0C. Corresponding untethered control peptides with N-methylglutamine at the i and i + 7 positions lacked helicity under the same conditions. Analogous peptides were also prepared for comparison using the thiolysine cross-linking method described previously [Jackson, D. Y.; King, D. S.; Chmielewski, J.; Singh, S.; Schultz, P. G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 9391\xe2\x88\x929392]. "
"The cyclopropylmethyl and (trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl)methyl radical clocks were used to estimate the lifetimes of triplet state biradicals formed from substituted 1-alkoxy-9,10-anthraquinones by photoexcitation and subsequent 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer. Irradiation (350 nm) of 1-(cyclopropylmethoxy)-2-methyl-9,10-anthraquinone (1cp) in argon-purged methanol generated the primary anthrahydroquinone product (2). Upon exposure to air, 2 was rapidly converted to cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde and 1-hydroxy-2-X-9,10-anthraquinone (3). In contrast, irradiation of 1-{(trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl)methoxy}-2-benzyl-9,10-anthraquinone (1pcp) under similar conditions produced only small amounts of 3 and the corresponding aldehyde, trans-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)carboxaldehyde. In addition, products resulting from rearrangement of the 1,5-biradical to a homoallylic 1,8-biradical were also obtained. Using the known rate constant for the rearrangement of the phenylcyclopropylmethyl radical to the homoallylic radical and the observed product ratio, lifetimes of approximately 1\xe2\x88\x922 ns were estimated for 1,5-biradicals from these anthraquinones which are about an order of magnitude shorter than those reported for triplet state biradicals derived from structurally related benzophenones and acetophenones. The short lifetimes of these biradicals are attributed to the facile formation of a zwitterion which results from an intramolecular electron transfer from one radical site, which serves as electron donor, to the other radical site, which is a semianthraquinone and therefore serves as a good electron acceptor. If either the electron-donating or electron-accepting site is absent in the biradical, zwitterion formation is not observed and coupling of the biradical occurs resulting in a longer lifetime. "
"Direct irradiation of ((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)pentamethyldisilane in hydrocarbon solution affords a mixture of reactive intermediates which have been detected and identified using laser flash photolysis techniques and trapped as the methanol adducts in steady state irradiation experiments. Flash photolysis of air-saturated hexane solutions of the disilane allows detection of transient species assigned to 1,1-dimethyl-3,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1-silaallene and dimethylsilylene, along with a non-decaying species assigned to 1,1-dimethyl-2,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1-silacyclopropene. These were identified on the basis of their UV absorption spectra and reactivity toward various reagents. The 1-silaallene is a minor photoproduct, but it is readily observable in transient absorption experiments because it is relatively long-lived (\xcf\x84 = 2.4 \xce\xbcs in air-saturated solution) and absorbs strongly, with absorption maxima considerably to the red of those of the 1-silacyclopropene. The 1-silaallene exhibits characteristic silene reactivity; it reacts with methanol, acetic acid, acetone (k = 106\xe2\x88\x92108 M-1 s-1) and oxygen (k \xe2\x88\xbc 108 M-1 s-1), exhibits low reactivity toward aliphatic dienes and tert-butyl alcohol, and decays with second-order kinetics in the absence of quenchers. With methanol and acetic acid, it has been shown that reaction in hexane occurs with the monomeric ROH species only. Steady state irradiations in the presence of methanol afford methanol-addition products consistent with the formation of the silaallene, silacyclopropene, and silylene, along with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene as the major product.

"Enantiodifferentiating photoisomerizations of (Z,Z)-1,3-cyclooctadiene (1ZZ) to the chiral E,Z-isomer 1EZ were performed at varying temperatures in the presence of some benzenepoly-, naphthalene(di)-, and anthracenecarboxylates. Of these chiral sensitizers, (\xe2\x88\x92)-menthyl benzenehexacarboxylate afforded the highest enantiomeric excesses (ee\'s) up to 10% and 18% in pentane at 25 and \xe2\x88\x9240 \xc2\xb0C, respectively. In contrast, the use of polar solvents greatly diminished the product\'s ee, suggesting intervention of a radical ionic rather than exciplex intermediate in these solvents. Optically pure 1EZ is shown to possess anomalously high specific rotation and circular dichroism as a simple diene chromophore:\xe2\x80\x89 [\xce\xb1]25D 1380\xc2\xb0 (CH2Cl2), \xce\x94\xce\xb5 12.8 M-1 cm-1 (\xce\xbbext 228 nm, cyclohexane).

"The stereochemistry of base-catalyzed H/D exchange on 13 \xce\xb2-substituted ethyl butanoates in ethanol-d has been studied in order to analyze the steric and electronic factors which control the diastereoselectivity of electrophilic attack on enolate anions. Electrophilic deuteration of the enolate anion also determines the stereoselectivity of 1,4-conjugate addition of ethanol-d to \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated esters. Experimental conditions were selected which rigorously exclude the effects of ion pairing and aggregation. The research showed that stereoelectronic factors generally produce higher stereoselection than steric effects do. Electronegative heteroatom substituents at C-3 produced a 10:1 ratio of the 2R*,3R*/2R*,3S* 2-deuteriobutanoates. In the most stable transition states for electrophilic attack, these electronegative substituents occupy an antiperiplanar position to the forming C\xe2\x88\x92D bond. Only with a \xce\xb2-tert-butyl substituent did steric effects produce high stereoselection, and it fell off rapidly with a decrease in carbon branching. Protonation of acyclic \xce\xb2-ethoxy aldehyde and ketone enolates follows the same diastereoselectivity pattern as the \xce\xb2-ethoxy ester enolate, but protonation of the cyanocarbanion from a \xce\xb2-ethoxy nitrile gives much lower stereoselection.

"The protonation of the enolate of 3-fluorobutanoic acid by hydrogen cyanide was chosen as a suitable computational model for the H/D exchange reaction of ethyl 3-ethoxybutanoate in ethanol-d. A diastereomeric excess of 82% is found in the experimental system, compared to calculated selectivities which range from 84 to 91%, dependent on the level of theory used. Both cis and trans enolates yield similar diastereomeric ratios. In the lowest energy transition state for each diastereomeric pathway the C\xe2\x88\x92F bond is oriented anti to the incipient C\xe2\x88\x92H bond. These two transition states are differentiated by steric forces, the higher energy diastereomer having a gauche interaction between the CH3 and CO2H groups. The orientation of the C\xe2\x88\x92F bond in these two transition states is rationalized as a stabilizing orbital interaction between the electron rich \xcf\x83 orbital of the enolate\xe2\x88\x92HCN bond and the low-lying \xcf\x83* orbital of the C\xe2\x88\x92F bond, an interaction also proposed by Anh to explain the selectivity of nucleophilic addition to chiral carbonyl compounds. Alternatively, an electrostatic argument can account for the data. When the C\xe2\x88\x92F bond is anti to the incipient C\xe2\x88\x92H bond, the dipole moment, and hence the electrostatic energy, is at a minimum. "
"The mixed tellurium/selenium Re6 clusters [NMe4]4[Re6(Te8-nSen)(CN)6] (n = 0\xe2\x88\x928) have been prepared from the reactions of Re6Te15 with the appropriate stoichiometry of NaCN and Se at 600 \xc2\xb0C, followed by cation exchange with NMe4Br. A typical anion comprises an Re6 octahedron with its eight faces capped by \xce\xbc3-chalcogen atoms to form a pseudocube, and each Re atom has a terminal cyanide ligand.

"Anthracene\xe2\x88\x92monoresorcinol derivative 1 forms hydrogen-bonded poly(resorcinol) 1D chains, which self-assemble via interpenetration or intercalation of the orthogonal anthracene (A) substituents.

The monomeric lattices show a remarkable linear-alkyl vs branched-alkyl selectivity in the guest-binding. The dimeric lattices are characterized by their exclusive emission of excimer fluorescence. Self-assembly of the present 1D chains is thus functional and also flexible and dynamic; removal, addition, and exchange of guest molecules readily occur in the solid states. "

"A family of compounds has been discovered in which pairs of octahedral rare-earth-metal clusters, each centered by a late transition metal Z, share a common edge. These R10Z2 units, sheathed and interbridged by iodine atoms, occur in the quaternary phases Rb2La10I17Co2, Cs2La10I17Z2 (Z = Co, Ni, Ru, Os), Cs2Ce10I17Os2, and Cs2Pr10I17Z2 (Z = Co, Ru, Os) and in the ternary La10I15Os2. All are obtained as black, air-sensitive crystals from reactions of RI3, R, Z, and RbI or CsI as appropriate in welded Nb containers at 800\xe2\x88\x92850 \xc2\xb0C. The structure of Cs2Ce10I17Os2 has been refined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods for comparison with the isotypic Cs2La10I17Co2 (monoclinic, C2/m, Z = 2, R(F)/Rw = 4.0/4.4%), and the structure of a unique ternary La10I15Os2 has been defined (triclinic, P1\xcc\x84, Z = 1, R/Rw = 5.0/5.1%). These new bioctahedral clusters may be regarded as the missing links between discrete clusters and infinite chains of condensed octahedral clusters among rare-earth-metal cluster halides that are stabilized by interstitial transition metals. The biclusters in both structures are extensively interconnected into three-dimensional arrays through bridging iodine atoms. The structural interconversion between Cs2La10I17Os2 and La10I15Os2 + 2CsI may be easily visualized in terms of changes in iodide bridging modes and accommodation of cesium cations. All the biclusters contain an odd number of cluster-bonding electrons, and this feature has been confirmed by magnetic susceptibility studies. EHMO cluster and band calculations on biclusters and their structures are in agreement with the localized bonding properties and ranges of electron counts. "
"Rapid-scan stopped-flow kinetic studies show that the multielectron oxidation of coordinated ammonia in cis-[Ru(bpy)2(NH3)2]2+ by acidic (pH 0.5\xe2\x88\x921.3) aqueous chlorine provides the nitrosyl complex cis-[Ru(bpy)2(NH3)(NO)]3+ as the final product. The first step in this process involves the metal-centered oxidation of cis-[Ru(bpy)2(NH3)2]2+ to cis-[Ru(bpy)2(NH3)2]3+, and the rate law for this process is \xe2\x88\x92d[Ru(II)]/dt = 2k1[Ru(II)][Cl2] with the second order rate constant, k1, as (1.1 \xc2\xb1 0.1) \xc3\x97 103 M-1 s-1. Independent studies conducted on the cis-[Ru(bpy)2(NH3)2]3+ complex show that conversion to the nitrosyl complex follows an A \xe2\x86\x92 B \xe2\x86\x92 C type consecutive pathway with kslow and kfast components, respectively. In the pH range of 0.5\xe2\x88\x922.8, the kslow process follows a competitive pathway where both Cl2 and HOCl react with deprotonated coordinated ammonia. The rate law for the kslow process has the form kslow = {(k2[H+][Cl-] + k3KCl)/(KCl + [H+][Cl-])}([Cl2]tot/[H+]), where KCl corresponds to the equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis of Cl2. The rate constant k2, corresponding to the Cl2 term, is 6.5 \xc2\xb1 0.3 s-1 while the rate constant k3, corresponding to the HOCl reaction, is 2.0 \xc2\xb1 0.2 s-1. The kfast process involves further oxidation of intermediate B by Cl2. The intermediate of this reaction is speculated as either a nitrene, nitrido, or chloroamine complex. The kinetic studies indicate that the conversion of this unidentified intermediate to the final nitrosyl complex proceeds through a fast preequilibrium, involving deprotonation of the intermediate, followed by a direct attack by Cl2. The rate law corresponding to the kfast process has the form kfast = [k4Kint[Cl2]tot[H+][Cl-]]/[{Kint + [H+]}{[H+][Cl-] + KCl}], the equilibrium constant Kint for the deprotonation process is 0.11 \xc2\xb1 0.04 M, and the rate constant k4 is (7.8 \xc2\xb1 1.5) \xc3\x97 102 M-1 s-1.

"A series of new organometallic polymers of the type {[M(dmb)2]Y}n (dmb = 1,8-diisocyano-p-menthane; Y = BF4-, NO3-, ClO4-, M = Cu; Y = BF4-, PF6-, NO3-, CH3CO2-, ClO4-; M = Ag) are reported. These materials have been characterized from single-crystal X-ray diffraction (for {[Ag(dmb)2]Y}n; Y = BF4-, NO3-, ClO4-), X-ray powder diffraction (which established the isostructurality between M = Cu and Ag and the relative crystallinity level), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), solid-state magic spinning angle and solution 13C-NMR, and spin\xe2\x88\x92lattice relaxation time measurements (T1, 13C-NMR). Three synthesis methods were employed in order to obtain highly crystalline, semicrystalline, and highly amorphous {[Cu(dmb)2]BF4}n polymers. One polymer has been successfully characterized from a light-scattering technique. For the amorphous {[Cu(dmb)2]BF4}n polymer, the molecular weights averaged 160\xe2\x80\x89000. The Ag polymers are found to be rather crystalline and exhibit very low solubility properties. Except for the {[Ag(dmb)2]PF6}n and the highly crystalline {[Cu(dmb)2]BF4}n materials, all polymers exhibit glass transitions in the 37\xe2\x88\x9296 \xc2\xb0C (305\xe2\x88\x92340 K) range, even if the materials exhibit a very large crystallinity level. The {[M(dmb)2]Y}n organometallic materials (M = Cu, Ag; Y = BF4-, PF6-, NO3-, CH3CO2-) are also strongly luminescent in the visible range (400\xe2\x88\x92600 nm) at 77 K, exhibiting polyexponential emission decay traces (either in the solid state or in solutions). By comparison with the emission properties of the non-polymeric [M(CN-t-Bu)4](BF4) compounds (M = Cu, Ag) as a model for a monomeric unit, the first and short-lived component of the emission decay traces (30\xe2\x88\x9290% in relative intensity) is associated with a higher-energy emission localized at one M center within the polymer (\xe2\x80\x9cmonomer-like emission\xe2\x80\x9d). This is also confirmed by time-resolved emission spectroscopy from the comparision with the emission maxima. The other components in the polyexponential decays are associated with lower-energy emissions that are only present in the polymers. This phenomenon is associated with an energy transfer metal-to-metal delocalized along the M chain somewhat similar to the exciton phenomenon known in organic solids. The depolarization of the emission light confirms the phenomenon. From density functional theory calculations, the lowest energy excited states have been assigned as MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) with the HOMO being the M centered d orbitals, and the LUMO being the \xcf\x80* MO centered on the isocyanide groups.

The kinetic isotope effects on both processes were measured, and the theory and equations for the determination of isotope effects in parallel reactions are presented. With complex 4 the kinetic isotope effects for the nucleophilic reaction were measured, as well as the equilibrium isotope effects on formation of the complex between Co(cyclen) and pNPP. The isotope effects sensitive to bond cleavage, 15k and 18kbridge, for the nucleophilic reactions were respectively 1.0021 \xc2\xb1 0.0002 and 1.0213 \xc2\xb1 0.0012 for 1, 1.0012 \xc2\xb1 0.0001 and 1.0098 \xc2\xb1 0.0010 for 2, and 1.0016 \xc2\xb1 0.0002 and 1.0207 \xc2\xb1 0.0006 for 4. All are indicative of substantial transition state bond cleavage in the rate-limiting step, and these results are most consistent with a concerted mechanism. The 18knonbridge isotope effects of 1.0006 \xc2\xb1 0.0002, 1.0045 \xc2\xb1 0.0003, and 1.0057 \xc2\xb1 0.0009 with 1, 2, and 4 indicate that the transition state has a slight associative character. The kinetic 18knonbridge isotope effects for dissociation of pNPP from 1 and 2 of 1.0135 \xc2\xb1 0.0004 and 1.0167 \xc2\xb1 0.0003 and the equilibrium one for 4 of 1.0081 \xc2\xb1 0.0006 are consistent with covalent character of the Co\xe2\x88\x92O bond.

"A series of redox-switchable hemilabile ligands (RHLs) has been synthesized that incorporates ferrocene as the redox group and phosphine ether or phosphine thioether moieties as binding groups. These ligands, which complex to Rh(I) and Pd(II), yield electrochemical control over ligand binding affinity for transition metals in complexes of the following type:\xe2\x80\x89 [M(\xce\xb74-(\xce\xb75-C5H4XCH2CH2PR2)2Fe)]y+ (5:\xe2\x80\x89 M = Rh, X = O, R = Ph (phenyl), y = 1; 6:\xe2\x80\x89 M = Rh, X = O, R = Cy (cyclohexyl), y = 1; 9:\xe2\x80\x89 M = Rh, X = S, R = Ph, y = 1; 10:\xe2\x80\x89 M = Pd, X = O, R = Ph, y = 2; 11:\xe2\x80\x89 M = Pd, X = O, R = Cy, y = 2). In the case of 11, ligand based oxidation decreases the ligand to metal binding constant by nearly ten orders of magnitude. An examination of the crystal structures of 5, 9, 10, and 11 and the electrochemical behavior of a series of RHL-complexes and isoelectronic model complexes reveals that electrostatic effects play a significant role in the charge dependent behaviors of these complexes. Additionally, there is a correlation between the phosphine substituents and RHL-complex stability. As a general rule cyclohexyl groups stabilize the complexes in their oxidized states over phenyl groups. In this study, RHLs are shown to provide a viable means of electrochemically controlling ligand binding affinity and thus the steric and electronic environment of bound transition metals. "
"Molecular orientation in hydrated cytochrome c (cyt c) films formed by adsorption to substrates of differing surface chemistry was investigated. The orientation distribution of the heme groups in the protein films was determined using a combination of two techniques:\xe2\x80\x89 absorption linear dichroism, measured in a planar integrated optical waveguide-attenuated total reflection geometry, and emission anisotropy, measured in a total internal reflection fluorescence geometry. The mean heme tilt angle and angular distribution about the mean were recovered using a Gaussian model for the orientation distribution. These data are the first orientation distribution measurements reported for protein film assemblies. The results show that a macroscopically ordered film of adsorbed cyt c molecules is produced when a single, high-affinity type of noncovalent binding occurs between the surface of the protein and the substrate surface. For example, electrostatic adsorption of the positively charged protein to the negatively charged head groups of a Langmuir\xe2\x88\x92Blodgett film of arachidic acid produces a narrow orientation distribution. When multiple, competing adsorptive interactions are operative, which is the case when cyt c adsorbs to a clean glass surface, a relatively disordered film is produced. "
"Molecular orientation in films of yeast cytochrome c immobilized via disulfide bonding between cysteine 102 and the thiol tail groups of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) coated on planar glass substrates was investigated. The orientation distribution of the heme groups in the protein film was determined using a combination of absorption linear dichroism, measured in a planar integrated optical waveguide-attenuated total reflection geometry, and emission anisotropy, measured in a total internal reflection fluorescence geometry. The mean heme tilt angle and angular distribution about the mean were recovered using a Gaussian model for the orientation distribution. These data are the first orientation distribution measurements reported for a protein film immobilized using a site-directed bonding strategy. The results show that the molecular architecture examined in this study does not produce a highly oriented protein film. A significant fraction of the immobilized cytochrome c is nonspecifically adsorbed to the SAM surface, which produces a relatively broad distribution of heme orientations. "
The rate constants and products for the reactions of Cl-(D2O)n + CH3Br (n = 1\xe2\x88\x923) have been measured. The n = 1 reaction was studied from 238 to 478 K. The rate constant is well described by k = (6.0 \xc3\x97 10-10) exp(\xe2\x88\x921270/T) cm3 s-1. We determined the reaction mechanism to be ligand switching to produce Cl-(CH3Br) followed by thermal decomposition of the complex. Cl-(CH3Br) decomposition produces greater than 90% Br- + CH3Cl with the remainder being Cl- + CH3Br. The Cl-(CH3Br) + He rate constant is well described by k = (4.5 \xc3\x97 10-10) exp(\xe2\x88\x922260/T) cm3 s-1. RRKM theory was used to model the decomposition of Cl-(CH3Br). The results are consistent with our experimental results if a central barrier height of 22.5 kJ mol-1 is used. The n = 2 and 3 reactions also proceed by ligand switching followed by thermal decomposition. The n = 2 reaction was studied from 203 to 298 K. The rate constant is well-described by (4.4 \xc3\x97 10-9) exp(\xe2\x88\x921329/T) cm3 s-1. The main product observed was Cl-(D2O) with a smaller amount of Cl-(D2O)(CH3Br) also detected. The n = 3 reaction was studied from 188 to 203 K. The reaction was about a factor of 1.8 faster than the n = 2 reaction. The main product was Cl-(D2O)2 with smaller amounts of Cl-(D2O)2(CH3Br) and Cl-(D2O)(CH3Br) also observed. 
"Rates of acid-catalyzed methoxy exchange between methanol and the three diastereomers of 2-methoxy-4,6-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane (6) were measured in benzene, and the rates for the two cis diastereomers were measured in methanol/chloroform. Rate constants were evaluated using a 1D-EXSY NMR pulse sequence and a weighted linear least squares analysis. Rates of methanol attack on the cationic intermediate (8) show 24-fold axial selectivity in benzene and 9-fold selectivity in methanol/chloroform. A ring-opening mechanism for equatorial exchange can be rejected, since rate constants kea and kae for direct axial/equatorial epimerization are zero. These results demonstrate that antiperiplanar lone pairs are more effective in this system than syn, although the effect is worth no more than 2 kcal/mol. "
"Two-photon chemistry of 1,8-bis(bromomethyl)naphthalene (1a) and 1,8-bis(chloromethyl)naphthalene (1b) was studied by (a) laser photolysis with use of XeCl (308 nm), KrF (248 nm), and ArF (193 nm) excimer lasers, (b) time-delayed, two-color photolysis with use of XeCl and XeF (351 nm) lasers, and (c) argon ion laser-jet (333, 351, and 364 nm) photolysis by both direct and benzophenone sensitization. The reaction proceeds through an intermediate monoradical 2, which is generated by a one-photon process, followed by additional photolysis to the two-photon product acenaphthene (4). On excitation of substrate 1 to its S1 state, monoradical 2 is formed directly from the S1 state and subsequently from the T1 state through intersystem crossing, alternatively on benzophenone sensitization. Upper excited states, namely S2 and S3, of 1 are proposed in the KrF and ArF excimer laser irradiation, generating intermediate 2 through fast fragmentation of the T(\xcf\x83*) state. Transient targeting of intermediate 2 by time-delayed, two-color photolysis and argon ion laser-jet photolysis increases considerably the yield of the two-photon product 4. "
"A computational study was undertaken to discern where and how chiral alkanes, alcohols, and acetates enantioselectively bind to permethyated \xce\xb2-cyclodextrin, the most commonly used chiral stationary phase in gas chromatography. We found that enantioselective binding data could be reproduced with standard molecular dynamics techniques if averages are taken over multiple trajectories of nanosecond simulation times each, while Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations using rigid body molecules are unable to reproduce chromatographic retention orders. Data extracted from the molecular simulations revealed the preferred binding site for small analytes to be the interior of the macrocycle, with rapid shuttling between the primary and secondary rims and low-energy excursions into and out of the host cavity. The dominant forces holding the host\xe2\x88\x92guest complexes together are the short range dispersion forces. The enantiodiscriminating forces responsible for chiral recognition are also the short range van der Waals forces and these enantiodifferentiating forces are typically 1\xe2\x88\x922 orders of magnitude smaller than the binding forces. An assessment of the number of hydrogen bonds for the diastereomeric complexes is presented along with the locations of dominant hydrogen-bonding sites on the macrocycle. A comparison is made between analytes capable of intramolecular hydrogen bonding with those that can not. It is pointed out that the 3-point binding description of chiral discrimination can be used, but it loses its appeal at such high temperatures due to ill-defined structures. "
" Heuristics for the rational design of aromatic polyketides were recently proposed and tested via the engineered biosynthesis of two novel products. Here we have applied these rules to a previously untested subclass of aromatic polyketides, the unreduced molecules. A recombinant strain of Streptomyces coelicolor expressing the genes for the frenolicin (fren) minimal polyketide synthase (PKS) and the TcmN subunit (a putative aromatase/cyclase) from the tetracenomycin PKS was constructed, and its principal product, the nonaketide PK8, was characterized by spectroscopic and isotope labeling methods. The structure of PK8 was exactly as predicted by the design rules. Surprisingly however, no major octaketide product was isolated from this strain. In contrast, a strain expressing the fren minimal PKS genes alone produced octaketides to the exclusion of nonaketides. These results differ from earlier reports of both octaketide and nonaketide products from strains containing the fren minimal PKS and a regiospecific ketoreductase. We therefore propose a model for bacterial aromatic polyketide biosynthesis in which auxiliary PKS subunits such as ketoreductases, aromatases, and cyclases can modulate the intrinsic specificity of the minimal PKS with respect to both the folding pattern and the chain length of the final product.

"This paper describes the design and synthesis of a series of conjugates derived from cholic acid, spermidine, and 5-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonyl (dansyl), which effectively shield the dansyl moiety from water. Direct coupling of cholic acid to both terminal amino groups of spermidine, and attachment of the environmentally-sensitive dansyl moiety to the remaining secondary amine, yields a \xe2\x80\x9cmolecular umbrella\xe2\x80\x9d (Ia) whose fluorescent properties (\xce\xbbmax and emission intensity) reflect a nonpolar microenvironment in water and one that is relatively polar in intermediate dimethoxyethane/water mixtures. Comparison of Ia with analogous \xe2\x80\x9csingle-walled\xe2\x80\x9d (II) and \xe2\x80\x9cno-walled\xe2\x80\x9d (III) umbrellas further indicates that a minimum of two walls is necessary in order to have \xe2\x80\x9cumbrella-like\xe2\x80\x9d properties. Examination of the fluorescent properties of a related double-walled umbrella, bearing a flexible (2-hydroxyethyl)carbamate moiety at the C-3 position of the sterol (Ib), reveals that \xe2\x80\x9cumbrella-like\xe2\x80\x9d properties are present even when facial amphiphilicity is not rigorously maintained; however, the molecule\'s ability to shield the fluorophore, as judged by its relative emission intensity, is diminished. \xe2\x80\x9cMethyl-capping\xe2\x80\x9d of the (2-hydroxyethyl)carbamate (i.e., Ic) enhances the umbrella\'s ability to provide a hydrophobic shelter in water. A tetra-walled analogue of Ia, bearing four cholic acid units (i.e., IV), has been synthesized and its dansyl group found to have reduced exposure toward water. The potential utility of molecular umbrellas in the area of drug delivery is briefly discussed. "
"The reaction mechanism of nucleophilic aromatic substitution of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene by glutathione (as modeled by a thiomethoxide ion) in the gas phase and in solution was elucidated using ab initio molecular orbital theory in combination with a continuum solvent model at the HF/6-31G*, HF/6-31+G**, and MP2/6-31+G** levels of theory. Two ion\xe2\x88\x92molecule complexes were located in the gas phase at the HF level, but only one exits at the MP2/6-31+G** level, while neither exits in aqueous solution. In aqueous solution, there is a large free energy barrier and C\xe2\x88\x92S bond formation is the rate-determining step, which is in agreement with experimental observation. The calculated free energy barrier (30.2 kcal/mol) at the HF/6-31+G** level of theory seems to be in good agreement with experiment (23.8 kcal/mol), while the MP2/6-31+G** barrier is too low, indicating that the MP2/6-31+G** level of theory probably overestimates the stability of the transition state for C\xe2\x88\x92S bond formation. Implications for the mode of action of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and a related enzyme are discussed in light of the results of the current study. "
"Full details are provided for an exceedingly practical method to synthesize d- and l-\xce\xb1-amino acids, N-protected \xce\xb1-amino acids, and N-methyl-\xce\xb1-amino acids, employing as a key step the asymmetric alkylation of pseudoephedrine glycinamide (1) or pseudoephedrine sarcosinamide (2). Practical procedures for the synthesis of 1 and 2 from pseudoephedrine and glycine methyl ester or sarcosine methyl ester, respectively, are presented. Optimum protocols for the enolization and subsequent alkylation of 1 and 2 are described. Alkylation reactions of 1 and 2 are found to be quite efficient with a wide range of alkyl halide substrates, and the products are formed with high diastereoselectivity. The products of these alkylation reactions are hydrolyzed efficiently and with little to no racemization simply by heating in water or water\xe2\x88\x92dioxane mixtures. This protocol provides an exceedingly practical method for the preparation of salt-free \xce\xb1-amino acids of high enantiomeric purity. Alternatively, the alkylation products may be hydrolyzed in high yield and with little to no racemization by heating with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The alkaline hydrolyzate can then be treated with an acylating reagent to provide directly highly enantiomerically enriched N-protected derivatives such as N-Boc and N-Fmoc. Key features necessary for the successful execution of these experimental procedures are identified. "
"The homogeneous atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of styrene using solubilizing 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-dialkyl substituted 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridines yielded well-defined polymers with Mw/Mn \xe2\x89\xa4 1.10. The polymerizations exhibited an increase in molecular weight in direct proportion to the ratio of the monomer consumed to the initial initiator concentration and also exhibited internal first-order kinetics with respect to monomer concentration. The optimum ratio of ligand-to-copper(I) halide for these polymerizations was found to be 2:1, which tentatively indicates that the coordination sphere of the active copper(I) center contains two bipyridine ligands. The exclusive role for this copper(I) complex in ATRP is atom transfer, since at typical concentrations that occur for these polymerizations (\xe2\x89\x8810-7\xe2\x88\x9210-8 M), polymeric radicals were found not to react with the copper(I) center in any manner that enhanced or detracted from the observed control. ATRP also exhibited first-order kinetics with respect to both initiator and copper(I) halide concentration; however, the polymerization kinetics were not simple inverse first-order with respect to the initial copper(II) halide concentration. The latter observation was found to be due to the persistent radical effect, which resulted in an increase in copper(II) concentration during the initial stages of the polymerization. This phenomenon also has the effect of regulating the polymerization by ensuring that the rate of radical combination and/or disproportionation is sufficiently less than the rate of propagation. "
"The design, synthesis, and in vitro evaluation of the novel carbocycles as transition-state-based inhibitors of influenza neuraminidase (NA) are described. The double bond position in the carbocyclic analogues plays an important role in NA inhibition as demonstrated by the antiviral activity of 8 (IC50 = 6.3 \xce\xbcM) vs 9 (IC50 > 200 \xce\xbcM). Structure\xe2\x88\x92activity studies of a series of carbocyclic analogues 6a\xe2\x88\x92i identified the 3-pentyloxy moiety as an apparent optimal group at the C3 position with an IC50 value of 1 nM for NA inhibition. The X-ray crystallographic structure of 6h bound to NA revealed the presence of a large hydrophobic pocket in the region corresponding to the glycerol subsite of sialic acid. The high antiviral potency observed for 6h appears to be attributed to a highly favorable hydrophobic interaction in this pocket. The practical synthesis of 6 starting from (\xe2\x88\x92)-quinic acid is also described. "
"Elimination reactions of aryl esters of arylacetic acids 1 and 2 promoted by R2NH in MeCN have been investigated kinetically. The reactions are second-order and exhibit \xce\xb2 = 0.44\xe2\x88\x920.84, |\xce\xb2lg| = 0.41\xe2\x88\x920.50, and \xcf\x81H = 2.0\xe2\x88\x923.6. Br\xc3\xb8nsted \xce\xb2 and |\xce\xb2lg| decrease with the electron-withdrawing ability of the \xce\xb2-aryl substituent. Hammett \xcf\x81H values remain nearly the same, but the |\xce\xb2lg| value increases as the base strength becomes weaker. Both \xcf\x81H and \xce\xb2 decrease with the change of the leaving group from 4-nitrophenoxide to 2,4-dinitrophenoxide. The results are consistent with an E2 mechanism and a reaction coordinate with a large horizontal component corresponding to proton transfer. When the base\xe2\x88\x92solvent system is changed from R2NH\xe2\x88\x92MeCN to R2NH/R2NH2+\xe2\x88\x9270 mol % MeCN(aq), the Br\xc3\xb8nsted \xce\xb2, \xcf\x81H, and |\xce\xb2lg| decrease. Finally, the ketene-forming elimination reactions from p-nitrophenyl p-nitrophenylacetate promoted by R2NH/R2NH2+ buffers in 70 mol % MeCN(aq) have been shown to proceed by concurrent E2 and E1cb mechanisms.

"The development of addition reactions wherein the product is the simple sum of the reactants plus anything else (only needed catalytically) constitutes an important goal for enhanced synthetic efficiency. The C\xe2\x88\x92H bond of terminal alkynes (the donor alkynes) can be added to either terminal alkynes (self-coupling) or activated internal alkynes (cross-coupling) (the acceptor alkynes) in the presence of a catalytic amount of palladium acetate and an electron rich sterically encumbered ligand, tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)phosphine. The activated internal alkynes for cross-coupling (the acceptor alkyne) include alkynes bearing an ester, sulfone, and ketone. Self-coupling is completely overwhelmed by cross-coupling, even at 1:1 ratios of donor and acceptor alkynes. The reaction exhibits extraordinary chemoselectivity with free carboxaldehydes, alcohols, ketones (saturated and conjugated), esters (saturated and conjugated), sulfones (saturated and conjugated), malonates, and silyl ethers all proving to be compatible. A 1:2 donor/acceptor alkyne adduct can also be optimized. Ethyl propiolate fails as an acceptor but its C-silylated analogue serves with the proper choice of silyl substituent. The products of the latter serve as useful precursors to \xce\xb2-keto esters. An iterative sequence is readily performed and led to a novel conformationally rigid retinoid analogue. The mechanism of this mild method for construction of conjugated enynes, versatile building blocks, is discussed. "
"The [4 + 4] photocycloaddition of butadiene + butadiene has been studied at the CASSCF /4-31G level, as a prototype for a class of photochromic systems. For this model system, minima and transition structures are characterized by analytic frequency calculations, and conical intersections are located. Our results indicate that the standard model for the [4 + 4] addition (based on H4) needs to be revised. The reorganization of all 8\xcf\x80 electrons is crucial (i.e., it is not always the same 4\xcf\x80 electrons that are important). Efficient nonradiative decay of butadiene + butadiene can be explained by the presence of two distinct S1/S0 conical intersections. The first-the lowest-energy point on S1 overall-is preceded by a barrier for the formation of a new \xcf\x83 bond. The resulting structure is similar to those previously characterized for methyl migration in but-1-ene and the addition of ethylene to benzene. A higher-energy barrier leads to a second crossing which resembles the rhomboidal funnel for the [2 + 2] addition of ethylene + ethylene, but which involves only one double bond from each butadiene. Both reaction paths commence at a true pericyclic minimum, at which the (S0\xe2\x88\x92S1) energy gap of \xe2\x88\xbc37 kcal mol-1 prohibits decay. "
"The nucleoside 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine (dGuo) was treated with 3-(hydroxymethyl)-3,4,4-trimethyl-1,2-dioxetane (HTMD), the latter generates efficiently triplet-excited carbonyl products on thermal decomposition in the dark. The type I photooxidation products, 2,2-diamino-[(2-deoxy-\xce\xb2-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-4-amino]-5(2H)-oxazolone (oxazolone) and the cyclic nucleoside 2-(S)-2,5\xe2\x80\x98-anhydro-1-(2-deoxy-\xce\xb2-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-5-guanidinylidene-2-hydroxy-4-oxoimidazolidine (oxoimidazolidine), as well as the type II photooxidation products 4-(R)*- and 4-(S)*-4-hydroxy-8-oxo-4,8-dihydro-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine (4-HO-8-oxodGuo) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo), were quantitatively determined by appropriate selective and sensitive HPLC assays. The concentration and time profiles revealed that about 40% of the triplet ketones derived from the thermal decomposition of HTMD led to photooxidation of dGuo. Essentially equal amounts of type I and type II photooxidation products were found, as could be established by comparison with predominant type I (benzophenone, riboflavin) and type II (Rose Bengal, methylene blue) photosensitizers. The participation of singlet oxygen (type II activity) was confirmed by the substantial D2O effect in the formation of 8-oxodGuo. The results demonstrate that dioxetanes, particularly HTMD, are efficient photooxidants of dGuo on thermal activation in the dark and constitute excellent chemical tools to study photobiological processes without the use of light, in the present case, photogenotoxicity.

"Red needle-like crystals of the title compound were grown using a reaction between Bi metal and methyl iodide under solvothermal conditions. CH3BiI2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/m with an unusual one-dimensional organic\xe2\x88\x92inorganic chain-like structure. The Bi atoms have a square pyramidal local geometry, with four I atoms forming the base and one methyl group occupying an apical site. Each basal square shares trans edges with two nearest neighbors to form a one-dimensional inorganic BiI2 chain along the b-axis. All methyl groups are covalently bonded to bismuth atoms and are aligned on one side of the BiI2 basal plane. The organic\xe2\x88\x92inorganic chains are held together via van der Waals interaction, forming an extended solid state structural array. Extended H\xc3\xbcckel band structure calculations demonstrate electronic one-dimensionality for CH3BiI2. Molecular modeling suggests that the square pyramidal Bi coordination arises primarily to reduce Bi\xe2\x88\x92C antibonding character in the HOMO. The resulting Bi 6s and 6p hybridization in the valence band (HOMO) leads to a stereochemically active lone pair oriented trans to each methyl group. Thermal stability and decomposition of the title compound is examined using GC mass spectroscopy and simultaneous TGA and DTA techniques. CH3BiI2 begins to decompose at 185 \xc2\xb0C in an inert atmosphere into methyl iodide and bismuth monoiodide, providing a new pathway to the formation of the interesting low valency one-dimensional conductor, BiI.

"The terminal step in methane generation by the archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum is catalyzed by the enzyme S-methyl coenzyme M reductase (methylreductase). This enzyme contains a Ni(II) tetrapyrrole cofactor, F430, at the active site in the resting state. A Ni(I) state (NiIF430) has been proposed as the active form of the cofactor. Nickel isobacteriochlorins have been used to model F430. We have investigated both NiIF430 and NiIOEiBC using CW and pulsed EPR and ENDOR spectroscopy at X-band and Q-band microwave frequencies. In agreement with a previous X-band EPR and ESEEM study, at Q-band, the g tensor of NiIF430 appears axial and 1,2H ENDOR of NiIF430 in H2O versus D2O solvent shows no evidence for strongly coupled, solvent-exchangeable hydrogens, and this indicates that there is no water axially coordinated to Ni(I) in contrast to the Ni(II) resting state. Both NiIF430 and NiIOEiBC give 14N ENDOR signals arising from the four pyrrole nitrogen ligands to Ni(I). Previous EXAFS studies of NiIOEiBC and NiIF430Me5 showed two sets of Ni(I)\xe2\x88\x92N distances differing by \xe2\x88\xbc8%, and in agreement with this, the14N ENDOR signals for both NiIOEiBC and NiIF430 can be analyzed in terms of superimposed signals from two distinct types of nitrogen ligand. The difference in bond lengths determined by EXAFS is reflected in different hyperfine and quadrupole coupling constants as determined by ENDOR. Comparison of these magnetic parameters for Ni(I) complexes with those for related species, such as CuIITPP, shows that one set of nitrogen ligands resembles porphyrin pyrrole, while the other set is distinctively different.

"The stability constants of the 1:1 complexes formed between Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, or Cd2+ and AMPS2-, i.e., of the M(AMPS) complexes, were determined by potentiometric pH titrations (25 \xc2\xb0C; I = 0.1 M, NaNO3). For the Mn2+/AMPS, Co2+/AMPS, Ni2+/AMPS, and Cd2+/AMPS systems also the protonated species M(H;AMPS)+ were quantified, and for the Zn2+/AMPS system, the stability of the hydroxo species Zn(AMPS)(OH)-, which results from the Zn2+\xe2\x88\x92thio coordination, could be determined. On the basis of previously established log versus p straight-line plots (R-MP2- = simple monophosphate ester ligands without further coordinating groups; Sigel, H.; et al. Helv. Chim. Acta 1992, 75, 2634), it is concluded that the alkaline earth ions in the M(AMPS) complexes are coordinated to the thiophosphate group with the same intensity as to a normal phosphate group. For the M(AMPS) complexes of Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+, it is shown by comparison with the corresponding M(AMP) complexes and by employing the mentioned straight-line plots that the stability increase is larger than may be expected due to macrochelate formation, which means that the metal ions also bind to the sulfur atom of the thiophosphate group. The stability increases amount for Mn(AMPS), Zn(AMPS), and Cd(AMPS) to about 0.2, 0.7, and 2.4 log units, respectively, and the estimated approximate percentages of the sulfur-coordinated species are about 30, 80, and 100%, respectively. Furthermore, comparisons between these stability increases and the solubility products for the corresponding metal ion sulfides, MIIS, as well as with the stability increases due to the M2+\xe2\x88\x92thioether interaction observed for the complexes of tetrahydrothiophene-2-carboxylate, which also result in straight-line plots, further support the conclusions about metal ion\xe2\x88\x92sulfur binding in the mentioned M(AMPS) complexes. The indicated correlations allow also an estimate for the extent of the M2+\xe2\x88\x92sulfur interaction in Pb(AMPS) and Cu(AMPS). The various isomers of the M(H;AMPS)+ species are analyzed in a microconstant scheme, and estimations about their formation degrees are presented; for example, for the Cd2+ system, (H\xc2\xb7AMPS\xc2\xb7Cd)+ is the dominating isomer, which has the proton at N1 and Cd2+ at the thiophosphate group. It is evident that for metal ions like (Mn2+), Zn2+, or Cd2+ the metal ion binding properties of the parent compound AMP2- and its thio analogue AMPS2- differ considerably, and therefore, great care should be exercised in enzymatic studies where AMPS2- is employed as a probe for AMP2- in the presence of metal ions. Regarding studies of ribozymes, it is of interest that plots are presented (pseudo-first-order rate constants versus complex stabilities) which suggest that on top of a sulfur\xe2\x88\x92metal ion interaction during the transition state of the rate-determining step of the hydrolytic cleavage of an oligonucleotide containing a bridged internucleotide 5\xe2\x80\x98-phosphorothioate RNA linkage also an oxygen\xe2\x88\x92metal ion interaction occurs and that the two effects are \xe2\x80\x9cadditive\xe2\x80\x9d.

"A high yielding, highly reproducible synthesis of the novel main group cluster Sn6(\xce\xbc3-O)4(\xce\xbc3-OSiMe3)4 (2), which involves the thermolysis of bis[bis(trimethylsilanolato)tin] (4) at 180 \xc2\xb0C, is reported. Spectroscopic and chemical analyses are fully consistent with the assigned structure of 2. A preliminary investigation of the reaction between this compound and Fe2(CO)9 reveals that the tin(II) centers of the former are capable of participating as 2e \xcf\x83-donors in the formation of the Fe(CO)4 adducts, [{Fe(CO)4} Sn6(\xce\xbc3-O)4(\xce\xbc3-OSiMe3)4] (5) and [{Fe(CO)4}2Sn6(\xce\xbc3-O)4(\xce\xbc3-OSiMe3)4] (6). The assigned structures of 5 and 6 are confirmed by spectroscopic and crystallographic analyses and the latter reveal important information regarding the influence that the steric features of 2 have on the coordination sphere of transition metal centers that are ligated to it. Space-filling models also reveal that additional complexation to 2, 5, and 6 is sterically permitted. Together, these findings provide an important platform upon which a variety of future studies that utilize 2 as a new class of building block for the construction of mixed p\xe2\x88\x92d metal compounds and materials can be based. Single crystals of 5 are (at 25 \xc2\xb0C) monoclinic, space group P21/n with a = 13.404(2) \xc3\x85, b = 16.964(3) \xc3\x85, c = 17.766(2) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 90.384(12)\xc2\xb0, V = 4039.7(10) \xc3\x853, and Z = 4 (Dcalcd = 2.139 mg m-3; \xce\xbc(Mo K\xce\xb1) = 41.57 mm-1).

"Four sodalite materials with Si/Al ratios of \xe2\x88\x9e, 23.0, 11.0, and 5.7 are synthesized from essentially nonaqueous media in which ethylene glycol is acting both as a solvent and as a structure-directing agent. Elemental and thermal analyses, X-ray powder diffraction, multinuclear MAS NMR, and vibrational spectroscopies are employed to extensively investigate the host\xe2\x88\x92guest interactions in as-synthesized materials. It is found that the hydrogen-bonding feature of the ethylene glycol molecules encapsulated within the \xce\xb2-cages of sodalites is strongly affected by the Al content in the framework. The overall results of this study lead us to conclude that the molecular conformation of ethylene glycol in the pure-silica \xce\xb2-cage may be tGg\xe2\x80\x98 stabilized only by one intramolecular hydrogen bond, while that of the guest molecule in the \xce\xb2-cage with a Si/Al ratio of 5 is gGg\xe2\x80\x98 stabilized by one strong hydrogen bond to the framework in addition to one intramolecular hydrogen bond.

"The synthesis, spectroscopy, and electrochemistry of the acyclic tertiary tetraamine copper(II) complex [CuL1](ClO4)2 (L1 = N,N\xe2\x80\x98-bis(2\xe2\x80\x98-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-N,N\xe2\x80\x98-dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine) is reported. The X-ray crystal structure of [CuL1(OClO3)2] reveals a tetragonally elongated CuN4O2 coordination sphere, exhibiting relatively long Cu\xe2\x88\x92N bond lengths for a CuII tetraamine, and a small tetrahedral distortion of the CuN4 plane. The [CuL1]2+ ion displays a single, reversible, one-electron reduction at \xe2\x88\x920.06 V vs Ag/AgCl. The results presented herein illustrate the inherent difficulties associated with the separation and characterization of CuII complexes of tertiary tetraamines, and some previously incorrect assertions and unexplained observations of other workers are discussed.

"Reaction of (\xce\xb75-C5Me5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCH) and Cu(OAc)2 (1.5 equiv, 80 \xc2\xb0C, pyridine) gives the orange-brown ReC4Re complex (\xce\xb75-C5Me5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCC\xe2\x8b\xaeC)(Ph3P)(ON)Re(\xce\xb75-C5Me5) (2, 88%) as a 50:50 diastereomer mixture. Crystallization affords (SS,RR)-2\xc2\xb72CH2Cl2 and solutions enriched in (SR,RS)-2 (meso). Addition of Ag+PF6- (\xe2\x89\xa52 equiv) yields deep blue (SS,RR)- and (SR,RS)-22+2PF6- (86%), which give two geometric isomers (62:38, 89:11; CD2Cl2, \xe2\x88\x9293 \xc2\xb0C) about the +ReCCCCRe+ linkages. Crystal structures of (SS,RR)-2\xc2\xb72CH2Cl2 and (SS,RR)-22+2PF6- show ReC4Re units with bond angles (169\xe2\x88\x92178\xc2\xb0) and lengths (C\xe2\x8b\xaeC, 1.202(7); C\xe2\x88\x92C 1.398(5); CC 1.260\xe2\x88\x921.305(10) \xc3\x85) near those of butadiyne or cumulenes. Natural bond order analysis and topological electron density calculations confirm the valence formulations. Reactions of (SS,RR)-2 with (SS,RR)-22+2PF6- or Ag+PF6- (1 equiv) give a green radical cation (SS,RR)-2\xe2\x80\xa2+PF6- (\xce\xbc = 1.74 \xce\xbcB; Faraday method). E\xc2\xb0 data yield a Kc value of 1.1 \xc3\x97 109 (CH2Cl2, 22.5 \xc2\xb0C) for the comproportionation. ESR spectra show undecets with Aiso,Re values (98 G) half those of related monorhenium radical cations, indicating spin delocalization over two rheniums (I = 5/2). Accordingly, IR spectra give only one \xcf\x85NO band, positioned between those of 2 and 22+2PF6- (CH2Cl2, 1665 vs 1623/1719 cm-1). Near IR spectra show unique solvent-independent bands (883, 1000, 1200 nm; \xce\xb5 15000, 9400, 3200 M-1 cm-1). Sodium naphthalenide reduces (SS,RR)- or (SR,RS)-2\xe2\x80\xa2+PF6- to (SS,RR)- or (SR, RS)-2, establishing configurational stability. These and related data are analyzed in detail. "
"A series of C60 derivatives substituted with the nitroxide group 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl have been synthesized. A detailed EPR and ENDOR study of the neutral radicals and of their reduction products is reported. All the neutral species give EPR spectra consisting of a main triplet of lines with \xe2\x88\xbc15 G splitting by the 14N nucleus, typical of nitroxide radicals. Some of them show additional well-resolved splittings by methyl and methylene protons, which are discussed in relation to the conformation of the nitroxide ring. When the compounds are progressively reduced under vacuum by contact with an alkali metal mirror, new EPR lines are observed; a 1:1:1 triplet with a splitting constant half that of a nitroxide radical and g = 2.0030 is attributed to biradical anions where one electron is located in the fullerene moiety and experiences a strong exchange coupling with the nitroxide unpaired electron. Frozen solution spectra of these species allow the determination of the electron\xe2\x88\x92electron dipolar interaction parameters which are compared with theoretical MO calculations. The experimental values agree with a spin distribution of one unpaired electron mostly in the equatorial plane of the fullerene. Another single line which appears in the spectrum as the reduction proceeds further on (g = 1.9999) is attributed to a new species:\xe2\x80\x89 possibly a substituted fullerene radical anion in which the nitroxide group is irreversibly reduced.

Novel two-dimensional magic-angle spinning (2D MAS) NMR experiments designed to measure the magnitudes and signs of 13C\xe2\x88\x921H dipolar interactions in fluid phase lipid bilayers are presented. MAS is employed throughout the experiments while dipolar recoupling is achieved (by radio frequency irradiation) during the evolution period. Multiple 13C\xe2\x88\x921H dipolar couplings are measured for a natural abundance sample of L\xce\xb1 phase dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC). The magnitudes of 13C\xe2\x88\x921H dipolar interactions are determined by fitting numerical simulations of recoupled powder line shapes with experimental data while the signs of these interactions are obtained by monitoring the buildup of antiphase magnetization by 13C detection. A comparison of the order parameters obtained by 13C\xe2\x88\x921H dipolar recoupling with those previously obtained for DMPC by 2H NMR indicates that dipolar recoupling is a viable method for determining segmental order in fluid phase lipid bilayers without recourse to isotopic enrichment. Measurement of the signs of 13C\xe2\x88\x921H dipolar couplings provides additional structural information that is unavailable through 2H NMR. The results obtained for DMPC suggest that the accuracy of the dipolar recoupling experiments presented in this work is competitive with that of previous techniques which require switched-angle spinning for the measurement of the magnitudes and signs of 13C\xe2\x88\x921H dipolar interactions in lipid bilayers. 
"The geometric structure and conformational properties of bis(fluorooxy)difluoromethane, CF2(OF)2, were determined by gas electron diffraction and theoretical methods (ab initio and density functional calculations). The electron diffraction intensities are reproduced best by a mixture of 70(10)% (+sc,+sc) and 30(10)% (sc,ap) conformers, corresponding to \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 = H\xc2\xb0(sc,ap) \xe2\x88\x92 H\xc2\xb0(+sc,+sc) = 0.9(3) kcal mol-1. This experimental result is reproduced very well by HF/6-31G* and MP2/6-31G* calculations (\xce\x94E = 0.7 kcal mol-1), but not by the HF/3-21G and the density functional (SVWN/6-311G*, BLYP/6-311G*, B3LYP/6-311+G*) approximations. In addition, the conformational properties of CF2(OH)2 and CH2(OF)2 were investigated theoretically. The experimental and theoretical results are discussed in terms of anomeric effects. "
"Ab initio molecular orbital calculations of the CCCSi torsion and the [1,3] sigmatropic silyl shift in allylsilane (SiC3H8, 1) have been carried out. It is clarified that the skew conformer of 1 is more stable than other conformers. Its torsional energy depends on the \xcf\x83\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 hyperconjugation as compared with that of 1-butene (2). In the [1,3] silyl shift, the reaction coordinate of the silyl-group migration in the early and final stages is congruent with that of the CCCSi torsion near the skew conformer. Divergence points on the inversion and retention paths are discussed from the viewpoint of the degree of nonplanarity of the migrating silyl group. The activation energy along the retention path is calculated to be lower than that along the inversion path at various levels of theory, which is in remarkable contrast to 2, in which the inversion path is more favorable. From the energetical viewpoint, the [1,3] shift of the silyl group is expected to proceed with retention of the silicon configuration at the migrating center. Although this looks like an exception to the Woodward\xe2\x88\x92Hoffmann rules, this may be caused by the nearly degenerate HOMO and (HOMO\xe2\x88\x921) in the transition state on the inversion path in 1. "
"The thermal decarboxylation of 2-oxetanones (\xce\xb2-lactones) to yield alkenes has been studied using ab initio SCF-MO computational methods. Solvent effects have also been taken into account. The reaction is predicted to be concerted in the gas phase, the corresponding transition structures having non-Woodward\xe2\x88\x92Hoffmann topologies. A set of 10 substituted 2-oxetanones has been studied, and it has been found that donating groups (methyl, vinyl, phenyl) at C4 facilitate the [2+2] cycloreversion. The saddle points which connect substrates and products are predicted to be highly polar in nature, and, therefore, even moderately polar solvents such as o-dichlorobenzene accelerate the reaction. trans-2-Oxetanones are predicted to react faster than their cis isomers if solvent effects are taking into account. Self-consistent reaction field methods based on multipole expansions of the free energy of solvation tend to overestimate the stability of zwitterionic intermediates at the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock level. This results in stepwise mechanisms in several cases, although higher levels of theory predict again concerted mechanisms. "
"The putative active site base of cholesterol oxidase from Streptomyces has been removed by site-directed mutagenesis and the mutant enzyme characterized. When glutamate-361 is mutated to a glutamine, the isomerization chemistry catalyzed by cholesterol oxidase is suppressed and the intermediate cholest-5-ene-3-one is isolated. The specific activity for oxidation is 20-fold slower than the wild-type reaction, though the specific activity for isomerization is 10\xe2\x80\x89000-fold slower. Furthermore, incubation of cholest-5-ene-3-one with the E361Q cholesterol oxidase resulted in the production of cholest-4-ene-6\xce\xb2-hydroperoxy-3-one (6%), cholest-4-ene-3,6-dione (32%), cholest-4-ene-6\xce\xb2-ol-3-one (36%), and cholest-4-ene-6\xce\xb1-hydroperoxy-3-one/cholest-4-ene-6\xce\xb1-ol-3-one (13%), in addition to cholest-4-ene-3-one (13%). Measurement of reaction stoichiometry eliminated the possibility that H2O2 or the C4a-hydroperoxy flavin was the oxygenation agent. It is proposed that cholest-4-ene-6-hydroperoxy-3-one is the product of radical chain autoxidation and that cholest-4-ene-3,6-dione and cholest-4-ene-6-ol-3-one are decomposition products of the hydroperoxy steroid radical. The characterization of the E361Q mutant chemistry has illuminated the importance of intermediate sequestration in enzyme catalysis. The mutant enzyme will be used to obtain information about the structure of the enzyme in the presence of the reaction intermediate. Moreover, the altered activity of E361Q cholesterol oxidase will facilitate its application in studies of cell membranes. "
"Herein, we report molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme human carbonic anhydrase II (HCAII) complexed with the substrate molecule bicarbonate using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) coupled potential. This study provides novel insights into bicarbonate binding and loss. In particular, we find that a structure related to the so-called Lipscomb binding motif is the global minimum, while the first formed Lindskog binding mode is unstable relative to alternative binding modes. From our simulated results we are able to postulate why Thr-199 destabilizes bicarbonate binding to HCAII (relative to the Ala-199 mutant) and how bicarbonate ion is displace by water to form the zinc\xe2\x88\x92water form of HCAII. This study also demonstrates the capability of QM/MM methods to elucidate structural and mechanistic aspects of enzyme mechanisms. "
"A suite of triple resonance NMR experiments for the assignment of backbone resonances of a larger protein using selectively 1H\xce\xb1 labeling to a sample uniformly labeled with 13C, 15N, and 2H is described. The relaxation time of 1H\xce\xb1\xe2\x88\x9213C\xce\xb1 zero/double quantum coherence was more than 4 times as long as that of 13C\xce\xb1 single quantum coherence. Three-dimensional HACAN, HACACB, HACACO, and HACA(N)CO experiments were newly designed to utilize selectively labeled 1H\xce\xb1 nuclei. HACAN provides intraresidue and sequential connectivities through amide 15N spins. HACACO and HACA(N)CO provide intraresidue and sequential connectivities through 13CO spins. HACACB provides connectivity to 13C\xce\xb2, giving the type of amino acid. Long-life 1H\xce\xb1\xe2\x88\x9213C\xce\xb1 zero/double quantum coherence provides high sensitivity in these NMR experiments. Except for a few amino acid type-specific problems, all sequential connectivities were obtained for a test sample of a 98 amino acid protein at 10 \xc2\xb0C, which rotationally diffuses with a correlation time of 17 ns, corresponding to an over 30 kDa protein at 30\xe2\x88\x9240 \xc2\xb0C. Zero/double quantum based triple resonance experiments and 1H\xce\xb1 selective labeling provide a new approach for NMR studies on larger proteins. "
"The ability of organisms to exercise control over crystal growth is wonderfully exemplified by skeleton formation in echinoderms. A sea urchin spine is a unique composite of a single crystal of calcite and glycoproteins intercalated inside the crystal during its growth. Here we performed a detailed morphological and high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction study of the textures of synthetic and biogenic calcite crystals. We show that the intracrystalline macromolecules from sea urchin spines, when allowed to interact with growing calcite crystals in vitro, selectively reduce the coherence lengths and degrees of alignment of the perfect domains in specific crystallographic directions. These directions also correspond to the newly-developed stable faces. In contrast, the defect distribution of young sea urchin spines composed entirely of spongy stereomic structure is much more isotropic. In mature spines containing secondarily filled-in wedges of calcite, the degree of anisotropy is intermediate between that of the synthetic crystals and the young spines. The macromolecules extracted from young and mature spines are, however, very similar. These observations demonstrate the inherent capability of occluded matrix macromolecules to finely differentiate between crystal planes by stereochemical recognition processes. They also show that in biologically-produced calcite crystals this process can be overridden to produce a more isotropic material. "
"The processes occurring during the electrochemically irreversible reduction of flavins in aprotic organic medium have been the cause of considerable controversy. To provide insight into these events we have investigated the reduction of flavins alkylated at N(3). We have demonstrated that the reversible reduction of N(3)-methylated flavin can be converted to the irreversible reduction observed with unalkylated flavins through addition of the weak external proton donor phthalimide. Proton transfer to the flavin radical anion generated at the electrode leads to partial formation of the neutral flavin radical, which is instantaneously further reduced to the fully reduced flavin anion. This mirrors the reduction of unalkylated flavins, where the proton source is the imide proton at N(3) of fully oxidized flavin in bulk solution. Simultaneous electrochemistry and EPR experiments confirm the disappearance of electrogenerated flavin radical anion both methylated and non-methylated at N(3), upon addition of phthalimide. UV/vis spectroelectrochemistry likewise confirmed the generation of the radical anion in the absence of proton donors and fully reduced flavin in the presence of proton donors. "
"The water-soluble polymer, poly(enolate-co-vinyl alcohol-co-vinyl acetate) (PEVV), prepared by controlled oxidation of poly(vinyl alcohol-co-vinyl acetate), is a valuable ligand for the rhodium biphasic catalytic hydroformylation of olefins. The average turnover frequency for the catalytic hydroformylation of 1-octene was 5.46 \xc3\x97 10-5 kmol (kg(Rh)s)-1 at 90 \xc2\xb0C, and that of 1-dodecene was 2.36 \xc3\x97 10-4 kmol (kg(Rh) s)-1 at 60 \xc2\xb0C. Selective hydroformylation of styrene and its derivatives gave up to 97% of branched-chain aldehyde using Rh\xe2\x88\x92PEVV under biphasic reaction conditions but at low conversions. "
"The resonance Raman intensities for parsley, spinach, and poplar a plastocyanins, blue copper proteins involved in plant photosynthetic electron transport, have been measured at wavelengths throughout the S(Cys) \xe2\x86\x92 Cu charge transfer absorption band centered at 597 nm in an effort to determine the role of amino acid composition on the dynamics of excited-state charge transfer. The resonance Raman spectra of the three plastocyanins exhibit vibrational bands with similar frequencies but different relative intensities. Self-consistent analysis of the absorption band and resulting resonance Raman excitation profiles for each of the plastocyanins demonstrates that many of the derived molecular parameters are similar, including the zero\xe2\x88\x92zero energy, the transition moment, and the homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths. However, significant differences are observed in the mode-specific excited-state geometry distortions even though the total, mode-specific reorganization energy obtained from the resonance Raman intensities of specific vibrations is 0.18 \xc2\xb1 0.01 eV for all three plastocyanins. A detailed comparison of the structural and electrostatic differences in spinach and poplar a plastocyanin using the previously reported structure of poplar a plastocyanin, potential energy minimization, and calculation of the electrostatic field with the linearized Poisson\xe2\x88\x92Boltzmann equation suggests that the mode-specific relative intensity differences arise from a change in the normal mode description due to differential coupling of internal coordinates localized on amino acid residues at least 8 \xc3\x85 from the copper site. These results demonstrate that the protein environment is strongly coupled to the copper site and that a significant portion of the protein, which is not involved in binding of redox partners, determines the copper site coordination geometry and resulting redox potential. An important result is that the mode-specific protein component of the reorganization energy on the 20 fs time scale is sensitive to protein composition differences that are at least 8 \xc3\x85 from the charge transfer site.

"The cationic Pd(II) complexes, [(phen)Pd(CH3)(L)]+[BAr\xe2\x80\x984]- phen = 1,10\xe2\x88\x92phenanthroline; L = Et2O, Me3SiC\xe2\x8b\xaeCSiMe3; Ar\xe2\x80\x98 = 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3) catalyze the hydrosilation and dehydrogenative silation of olefins. Hydrosilation of ethylene, tert-butylethylene, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene by HSiR3 (R = CH2CH3, C6H5) occurs in the presence of 1 mol % [(phen)Pd(CH3)(L)]+[BAr\xe2\x80\x984]-. The reaction of tert-butylethylene with HSi(i-Pr)3 in the presence of [(phen)Pd(CH3)(L)]+[BAr\xe2\x80\x984]- yields neohexane and t-BuCHCHSi(i-Pr)3. Low-temperature NMR experiments revealed that the catalyst resting state for the silations of ethylene and alkyl-substituted olefins is [(phen)Pd(SiR3)(\xce\xb72-H2CCHR\xe2\x80\x98)]+[BAr\xe2\x80\x984]-. Evidence for rapid, reversible silyl migration at \xe2\x88\x9270 \xc2\xb0C was observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Deuterium labeling studies show that the intermediate Pd(II) alkyl complexes can isomerize via a series of \xce\xb2-hydride eliminations followed by reinsertions of olefin prior to reaction with DSiEt3. Styrene undergoes both hydrosilation and dehydrogenative silation in the presence of [(phen)Pd(CH3)(L)]+[BAr\xe2\x80\x984]- or [(phen)Pd(\xce\xb73-CH(CH3)C6H5)]+[BAr\xe2\x80\x984]- yielding ethylbenzene, R3SiCH2CH2C6H5 and trans-R3SiCHCHPh (R = CH2CH3, CH(CH3)2). 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed that the \xcf\x80-benzyl complexes [(phen)Pd(\xce\xb73-CH(CH2SiR3)C6H5)]+[BAr\xe2\x80\x984]- and [(phen)Pd(\xce\xb73-CH(CH3)C6H5)]+[BAr\xe2\x80\x984]- are the catalyst resting states for the silation reactions of styrene.

"Serine, threonine-derived (4S)-oxazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, and cysteine-derived (4R)-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid, denoted pseudo-proline (Xaa[\xce\xa8R1,R2pro]), serve as structure disrupting, solubilizing building blocks in peptide synthesis. Variation of the 2-C substituents within the heterocyclic system results in different physicochemical and conformational properties. NMR studies of a series of pseudo-proline (\xce\xa8Pro)-containing peptides reveal a pronounced effect of the 2-C substituents upon the cis to trans ratio of the adjacent amide bond in solution. 2-C unsubstituted systems show a preference similar to that of the proline residue for the trans form, whereas 2,2-dimethylated derivatives adopt the cis amide conformation in high content. For 2-monosubstituted \xce\xa8Pro, the cis\xe2\x88\x92trans distribution depends on the 2-C chirality. For the 2-(S)-diastereoisomer, both forms are similarly populated in solution, whereas the 2-(R)-epimer adopts preferentially the trans form. The results are supported by conformational energy calculations and suggest that, by tailoring the degree of substitution, pseudo-prolines may serve as a temporary proline mimetic or as a hinge in peptide backbones.

"In order to accomplish the selective synthesis of [60]fullerene bisadducts, the reactions of [60]fullerene with compounds in which two \xce\xb1,\xce\xb1\xe2\x80\x98-dibromo-o-xylene moieties were connected by an oligomethylene chain (n = 2\xe2\x88\x925) were investigated. By this method, only two isomers (cis-2- and cis-3-isomers) were selectively obtained when n = 2 and 3, while another isomer (e-isomer) was obtained when n = 5. When n = 4, a complex mixture of bisadducts was formed and has not been separated so far. cis-2-Bisadducts have been, for the first time, selectively obtained in the fullerene chemistry. The structures of bisadducts were determined on the basis of 1H, 13C NMR, IR, UV\xe2\x88\x92vis, and mass spectroscopies. According to the NMR experiments, the symmetries of cis-2-, cis-3-, and e-isomers were concluded to be Cs, C2, and C1, respectively. Chiral cis-3- and e-bisadducts were successfully resolved into the respective enantiomers on a chiral HPLC column, although cis-2-bisadducts only gave a single peak. The UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectra of cis-2-, cis-3-, and e-bisadducts were remarkably different from one another. Specifically, the e-bisadducts showed a characteristic absorption peak around 420 nm. The cleavage of the oligomethylene chain produced the corresponding [60]fullerene derivatives possessing two phenol moieties. These compounds are applicable to further functionalization. "
"Studies are presented on the two-dimensional (2-D) crystalline packing arrangements of enantiomerically pure and racemic \xce\xb1-amino acid RHC(NH3+)CO2- monolayers on water and on glycine aqueous solutions, as determined by synchrotron grazing incidence X-ray diffraction. The amphiphiles have been designed such that their racemic mixtures form 2-D crystals which are either heterochiral (for R = CnH2n+1\xe2\x88\x92, n = 10, 12, 16) due to the tendency for herringbone chain arrangements via glide symmetry or homochiral (for R = CnH2n+1CONH(CH2)4\xe2\x88\x92, n = 11, 17, 21) by virtue of hydrogen bonding by translation of the amide group in the chains leading to a spontaneous separation into islands of opposite chirality. The two different crystalline motifs led to a correlation between their packing arrangements and induced oriented nucleation of 3-D crystals of \xce\xb1-glycine by these monolayers. The relevance of the present results to the possibility of ordering and spontaneous segregation of racemates of the natural hydrophobic \xce\xb1-amino acids at the air-solution interface is discussed.

"Treatment of C70 with (2-methoxyethoxy)methyl azide gives rise to three out of a possible six triazoline isomers, showing chemoselectivity as well as regioselectivity. The major product arose from addition of azide to the double bond of C70 possessing the greatest local curvature. Selective thermolysis of the least stable triazoline, the one resulting from addition to the least curved [6,6] double bond, allowed solution of the structure of the three isomers. Thermolysis of the triazoline isomers produced mixtures of C70, azafulleroids, and fulleroaziridines. "

In the preceding paper we discussed the construction of common building blocks A\xe2\x88\x92C and their linkage to provide the C(21\xe2\x88\x9242) segments of 1 and 2. Herein we describe model studies of triene generation and hydroxyl deprotection, the preparation and coupling of building blocks D and E, a two-step protocol for macrocycle formation via union of the ABC and DE subtargets, and completion of the total syntheses. The synthesis of 27-demethoxyrapamycin (2) confirmed the assigned structure. "
"A systematic steady-state fluorescence and time-resolved flash photolytic investigation of a series of covalently linked fullerene/ferrocene based donor\xe2\x88\x92bridge\xe2\x88\x92acceptor dyads is reported as a function of the nature of the spacer between the donor site (ferrocene) and acceptor site (fullerene) and the dielectric constant of the medium. The fluorescence of the investigated dyads 2 (\xce\xa6rel = 0.17 \xc3\x97 10-4), 3 (\xce\xa6rel = 0.78 \xc3\x97 10-4), 4 (\xce\xa6rel = 1.5 \xc3\x97 10-4), 5 (\xce\xa6rel = 0.7 \xc3\x97 10-4), and 6 (\xce\xa6rel = 2.9 \xc3\x97 10-4) in methylcyclohexane at 77 K were substantially quenched, relative to N-methylfulleropyrrolidine 1 (\xce\xa6rel = 6.0 \xc3\x97 10-4), indicating intramolecular quenching of the fullerene excited singlet state. Excitation of N-methylfulleropyrrolidine revealed the immediate formation of the excited singlet state, with \xce\xbbmax around 886 nm. A rapid intersystem crossing (\xcf\x841/2 = 1.2 ps) to the excited triplet state was observed with characteristic absorption around 705 nm. Picosecond resolved photolysis of dyads 2\xe2\x88\x926 in toluene showed light-induced formation of the excited singlet state which undergoes rapid intramolecular quenching, with rate constants of 28 \xc3\x97 109 s-1, 6.9 \xc3\x97 109 s-1, 3.4 \xc3\x97 109 s-1, 14 \xc3\x97 109 s-1, and 2.3 \xc3\x97 109 s-1, respectively. Nanosecond-resolved photolysis of dyads 3 and 4 in degassed benzonitrile revealed long-lived charge separated states (\xcf\x841/2 = 1.8 \xce\xbcs (3) and \xcf\x841/2 = 2.5 \xce\xbcs (4)) with characteristic fullerene radical-anion bands at \xce\xbbmax = 1055 nm. The nature of the spacer between C60 and ferrocene, weak electronic ground-state interactions, steady-state fluorescence, and picosecond-resolved photolysis suggest two different quenching mechanism:\xe2\x80\x89 through-bond electron transfer for dyads 2, 5, and 6 and formation of a transient intramolecular exciplex for dyads 3 and 4.

"Diphenylsulfene (5) and diphenyl-\xce\xb1-sultine 6 were generated in cryogenic matrices by three independent routes:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) the thermal reaction of diphenylcarbene (8) and SO2, (ii) the photochemically induced hetero Wolff rearrangement of sulfonylcarbene 11, and (iii) oxygen transfer from ozone to diphenylsulfine 16. Isotopic labeling with 13C and 18O allows for the assignment of several characteristic IR vibrations of 5. Irradiation with \xce\xbb > 375 nm results in the rearrangement of 5 to 6, which is the first \xce\xb1-sultine that has been characterized spectroscopically. The final product on UV irradiation of 6 is benzophenone (9) and sulfur monoxide. "
"The mechanism of photosensitized nucleophilic substitution reactions on arylcyclopropanes was investigated. Stereochemical experiments with methanol, water, and cyanide as nucleophiles showed that the reactions occurred stereospecifically with complete inversion of configuration at the carbon atom undergoing substitution. Independent generation of the arylcyclopropane cation radicals by nanosecond transient methods showed that they reacted rapidly with nucleophiles with kinetics that were first-order in both the cation radical and the nucleophiles. Through a combination of transient kinetics and steady-state Stern\xe2\x88\x92Volmer quenching experiments, the reaction of the phenylcyclopropane cation radical with methanol was kinetically correlated with the formation of the substitution product. The reaction of phenylcyclopropane cation radical with a series of alcohols as nucleophiles showed small steric effects. "
"The nucleophilic substitution reactions on substituted arylcyclopropane cation radicals were studied by a combination of methods including product studies, time-resolved laser flash photolysis, kinetic isotope effects, and quantum chemical calculations. The reactions were found to proceed stereospecifically with inversion of configuration, with high regioselectivity for nucleophilic attack at the more substituted carbon atom, and with very small steric effects. Electronic effects on the nucleophilic substitution regiochemistry and the rate constants were found to be substantial for substituents on the cyclopropane moiety and on the aryl ring. "
"Generations 1\xe2\x88\x925 of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers were peripherally modified with cationically substituted naphthalene diimides. Reduction with sodium dithionite in water or formamide formed anion radicals on the diimide moieties. Evaporation of water under argon produced powders of the reduced dendrimers that were electrically conductive. Using formamide as solvent, films were cast of reduced generation-3 modified dendrimers. Fully reduced films (1.1 e/diimide) gave conductivities under ambient conditions of about 10-3 S/cm. Films formed from these dendrimers that were half-reduced (0.55 e/diimide) gave \xcf\x83 = 10-2 S/cm. Near-infrared (NIR) spectra on the films showed the formation of \xcf\x80-stacks with maximum absorbance beyond 2000 nm. The wavelength and intensity of this absorbance correlated with the conductivity. The conductivity increased with increased humidity above the films reaching values as high as 18 S/cm at 90% relative humidity. The conductivity was in all cases electronic and isotropic. The conductivity\xe2\x88\x92humidity effect was probed by NIR spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and quartz crystal microbalance measurements. These studies suggest that the amorphous films absorb water from the air and at high humidity they are plasticized, allowing faster stack-to-stack electron hopping and increased conductivity. "

The square with four Fe(III) ions at the corners and four trans Ni(II) on the edges shows a slight distortion to a rhombus. A ferromagnetic interaction operates within the sheet in all the compounds. The overall magnetic property is governed by the intersheet separation:\xe2\x80\x89 a small intersheet separation provides metamagnets (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11) owing to intersheet antiferromagnetic interaction, whereas a large intersheet separation (>10 \xc3\x85) provides ferromagnets (5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12).

Each Au(II) atom, at 1\xcc\x84, is at the center of an elongated octahedron of F ligands; the four F\'s of the approximately square AuF4 unit are at 2.09(2) \xc3\x85 \xc3\x97 2 \xc3\x85 and 2.15(2) \xc3\x85 \xc3\x97 2, each F provided by a different SbF6 species. The two long Au\xe2\x88\x92F interatomic distances are at 2.64(2) \xc3\x85. The SbF6 are grossly distorted in their interactions with the Au. A cis pair of F ligands of each SbF6, make close approach to two different gold atoms, stretching Sb\xe2\x88\x92F to 1.99(2) and 1.94(2) \xc3\x85. In each case the Sb\xe2\x88\x92F distances trans to these stretched Sb\xe2\x88\x92F bonds are short, being 1.85(2) and 1.84(2) \xc3\x85, respectively.

"The kinetics of the reaction of a series of aromatic and aliphatic thiols with cluster 1 were determined. These reactions form cluster 2 and the arene or alkane corresponding to the thiol:\xe2\x80\x89 Cp\xe2\x80\x982Mo2Co2S3(CO)4 (1) + RSH \xe2\x86\x92 Cp\xe2\x80\x982Mo2Co2S4(CO)2 (2) + RH + 2CO. These reactions are first order in thiol and first order in cluster 1 with appreciable negative entropies of activation. These data suggest that the rate determining step of the desulfurization reaction is the initial association of the thiol to the cluster. The more nucleophilic thiolate anions react with 1 at \xe2\x88\x9240 \xc2\xb0C to form an adduct in which the thiolate anion is bound \xce\xb71 to the Co atom. At \xe2\x88\x9225 \xc2\xb0C, the initial adduct rearranges to a fluxional \xce\xbc2, \xce\xb71-bound thiolate. The fluxional process is proposed to involve a concerted \xe2\x80\x9cwalking\xe2\x80\x9d of the thiolate and a \xce\xbc2-bound sulfide ligand on the surface of the cluster. Near 35 \xc2\xb0C, the thiolate\xe2\x88\x92cluster adduct undergoes C\xe2\x88\x92S bond homolysis to give the paramagnetic anion of cluster 1 and the phenyl or alkyl radical. The radical nature of the C\xe2\x88\x92S bond cleavage was confirmed by the desulfurization of the radical clock reagents, cyclopropylmethanethiol and -thiolate anion, that form the cyclopropylmethyl radical which rearranged to the butenyl radical. The possible similarity in the C\xe2\x88\x92S bond cleavage mechanism in these desulfurization reactions to those occurring in hydrodesulfurization (HDS) over Co/Mo/S catalysts is discussed. "

The resulting trigonal prism has \xce\xb72-\xce\xbc4-peroxo ligands bridging each rectangular face and \xce\xb72-\xce\xbc2-acetates bridging each edge of the rectangular and triangular faces. Two distinguishing structural features are an elongated O\xe2\x88\x92O bond distance of 1.472(9) \xc3\x85 for the bridging peroxo ligand and significant displacement of this group by 1.05 \xc3\x85 out of the plane of the four iron atoms that it links. The \xce\xbdO-O stretching mode is readily observed by Raman spectroscopy at 844 cm-1, as in other peroxo-bridged polyiron(III) complexes, but the UV\xe2\x88\x92visible spectrum lacks the distinctive charge transfer band in the 500\xe2\x88\x92800 nm region found in most other ferric peroxo species.

"A method that allows the specific immobilization of proteins onto a gold electrode has been developed. Mixed self-assembled monolayers of thiol chains functionalized with choline and hydroxyl groups have been synthesized step-by-step over a template of thiocarboxylic acid adsorbed onto gold. Choline-functionalized monolayers displayed affinity for a chimera protein made by the fusion of the \xce\xb2-galactosidase (\xce\xb2-Gal) from Escherichia coli and the choline-binding domain of the (acetylmuramoyl)-l-alanine amidase (C-LYTA) from Streptococcus pneumoniae. This chimera maintains both the hydrolase activity and the affinity for choline, respectively, of its parent proteins. The binding of the protein to the tailored interface was specific and could be inhibited either by soluble choline or by saturating the monolayer choline groups with the C-LYTA fragment. Using an 35S-labeled chimera, saturation coverage was found under optimized binding conditions. The activity of the immobilized chimera was determined with (p-aminophenyl)-\xce\xb2-d-galactopyranoside, a synthetic substrate of \xce\xb2-galactosidase. The product of the enzymatic reaction, p-aminophenol, was detected electrochemically using the functionalized gold surface with bound chimera protein as a working electrode in a conventional electrochemical cell. Gold electrodes covered with chimera protein were very stable and gave fast and reproducible electrochemical response to the addition of \xce\xb2-Gal substrate in a conventional flow injection analysis system.

"High-level ab initio calculations carried out up to an effective MP4SDQ/6-311+G(3df,2p)//HF/6-31+G* level predict that the trimethylamine\xe2\x88\x92formic acid complex in vacuo is favored by 7.0 kcal/mol (\xce\x94G298) relative to the trimethylammonium\xe2\x88\x92formate complex.

Calculations on the effect of a dielectric continuum on the binary and monohydrated ternary complexes using the Self-Consistent Isodensity Polarized Continuum Model (SCI-PCM) indicate that a strong dielectric continuum with a dielectric constant larger than ca. 9 is required to make the binary ion-pair complex predominant. However, only a relatively weak dielectric continuum with a dielectric constant in the range of 4\xe2\x88\x926 is required in order to favor the monohydrated ion-pair complex. "
"The ground state energies and structures of octamers of poly(methyl)iminomethylene are investigated ab initio at the 6-31G* SCF and MP2 levels and compared with those produced by molecular mechanics (MM), using Allinger\'s MM3 force field. The torsional parameters used in MM3 calculations for the dihedral angle NCCN (\xcf\x86) have been obtained from ab initio calculations of model diimines ((E,E), (E,Z), and (Z,Z) N,N\xe2\x80\x98-diisopropylethanediimine], in the flexible rotor approximation. At the MM level, bulkier substituents have been considered as well (R = isopropyl, 1-cyclohexylethyl). Both at the ab initio and classical level, conformations close to a 41 helix are found to be stable, but they never are the absolute minimum. The minimum energy geometry shows a regularly alternating disposition of the substituents on the iminic double bonds (syndio configuration):\xe2\x80\x89 its backbone conformation (dihedral angles \xcf\x86) shows dimeric sections which are alternatively trans-planar (E,E sections) and close to \xc2\xb190\xc2\xb0 (Z,Z sections). The energy gap between the syndio geometry and the 41 helix amounts to \xe2\x88\xbc30 kcal/mol in the methyl oligomer at the ab initio level vs \xe2\x88\xbc11 kcal/mol at the MM3 level. This latter value does not change significantly passing from methyl to isopropyl and 1-cyclohexylethyl. Also, conformations having an inversion of the helical sense along the chain (wormlike chains) are found to be stable according to both calculation methods, and their energies are comparable to those of helical conformers. CD calculations were carried out employing an independent systems approach. The calculated intensities of the CD bands of a model 41 helix are much higher than what experimentally found, while those calculated for the syndio structure (considered as composed of a series of diiminic units) are comparable to experiment. A negative CD band is predicted to be associated with the n\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80* transition of the iminic chromophore in a 41 P-helix, as previously found in the literature. The preference for nonhelical conformers could account for various features observed in the UV, CD, and NMR spectra of some poly(iminomethylenes), as reported in literature (absorption at long wavelengths, low intensity of CD bands, chemical shift dispersion of backbone carbons resonances).

"Relative strengths of normal and low-barrier hydrogen bonds (LBHBs) in the gas phase were analyzed by means of quantum-mechanical and thermodynamic calculations on the mesaconic/citraconic and several maleic/fumaric cis/trans isomerization equilibria. All geometries were fully optimized with correlation effects included via second-order M\xc3\xb8ller\xe2\x88\x92Plesset perturbation theory. The cis isomer of the maleic monoanion (also known as hydrogen maleate) is greatly stabilized in the gas phase owing to the formation of an intramolecular low-barrier hydrogen bond more than 20 kcal/mol stronger, in free energy terms, than the corresponding normal intramolecular hydrogen bond in maleic diacid. The very short internuclear distance (2.41 \xc3\x85) obtained at the MP2 level between the hydrogen donor and the hydrogen acceptor in hydrogen maleate, as well as the high value of the NMR chemical shift for the participating proton, are two other characteristics experimentally attributed to the formation of an LBHB. The transition state structure for proton exchange in the maleic monoanion is symmetrical. In this structure, the interactions of the central hydrogen atom with the acceptor and the donor atoms are classified as covalent by Bader\'s theory of molecular structure. In any case, our calculations indicate that the zero-point energy for maleate monoanion is above the energy barrier for proton transfer. This fact allows free motion of the hydrogen atom lying on the ground vibrational state in accordance with the single symmetrical minimum experimentally predicted in nonpolar solvents. "
"Three possible pathways for the acyloxy rearrangement in (acyloxy)ethyl radicals have been investigated with ab initio quantum chemical methods. For migrations of formyloxy, acetyloxy, and (trifluoroacetyl)oxy groups the concerted [3,2]-acyloxy shift represents the most favorable pathway. The barrier for the concerted [1,2]-acyloxy shift is higher by approximately 4 kcal/mol in all three cases, while a stepwise mechanism through a ring-closure/ring-opening sequence is even less favorable. Calculations using the hybrid Becke3LYP density functional and a variety of basis sets predict the barrier for the acetyloxy shift to be higher by 3 kcal/mol than the barrier for the (trifluoroacetyl)oxy shift. This value is less than half what has been determined experimentally before. The effects of aqueous solvation have been studied with the AM1\xe2\x88\x92SM2 and the SCIPCM continuum models and by explicitly including two water molecules into the system. In all three cases, only small solvent effects have been found for the acetyloxy rearrangement, in contrast to previous experimental evidence. Proton catalysis has been studied for the formyloxy rearrangement at the Becke3LYP level and has been found to lower the gas phase barrier by more than 10 kcal/mol. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that acid catalysis might be an important aspect of acyloxy rearrangements in solution. "

Chain initialization proceeds in a stepwise fashion, with an overall activation barrier of 11.1 kcal/mol. Chain propagation can proceed via two different pathways, which have similar activation energies (16.8 and 17.5 kcal/mol, respectively). In contrast to behavior observed for metallocene catalysts, none of the insertion transition states show agostic stabilization. The activation energy for chain isomerization is 12.8 kcal/mol, which proceeds via a concerted mechanism, rotating the chain and simultaneously abstracting the \xce\xb2-agostic hydrogen. Chain termination occurs via a stable hydride intermediate, which is formed with a barrier of 9.7 kcal/mol and decays into the termination product with a small activation energy of 1.7 kcal/mol. Production of experimentally observed high molecular weight polymers can only be explained by suppression of the chain termination transition state due to sterically demanding substituents on the diimine ligand.

"An ab initio investigation of a pyranosyl oxocarbenium ion with an \xce\xb1-carboxylate substituent is presented. Geometry, energetics, and isotope effects have been determined in the gas phase and with solvation models. RHF/6-31G* geometry optimizations identified a minimum for the oxocarbenium ion in which the ring atoms comprising the oxocarbenium ion lie in a plane, and the carboxylate group is twisted by 82\xc2\xb0 relative to this plane. A transition state conformer was identified which placed the carboxylate group in the oxocarbenium ion plane. The transition state conformer was \xe2\x88\xbc5 kcal/mol higher in energy than the twist conformer (B3LYP/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G*). Single point calculations using density functional theory on the structures optimized at the RHF level indicate that in the gas phase an \xce\xb1-carboxylate stabilizes an oxocarbenium ion by 110 kcal/mol relative to an H-substituted oxocarbenium ion. Inclusion of solvation in the energy calculation by use of a self-consistent isodensity polarized continuum model lowers the stabilization to 17 kcal/mol in water. Equilibrium 14C and 2H isotope effects have been calculated for formation of the carboxylate-substituted oxocarbenium ion and are compared to the experimentally determined kinetic isotope effects for acid-catalyzed solvolysis of cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminate (CMP-NeuAc) (Horenstein, B.A.; Bruner, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 10371\xe2\x88\x9210379). The calculations support a transition state model which features a nearly fully formed sialyl oxocarbenium ion with the carboxylate group planar or near planar to the oxocarbenium ion plane. A rationale is provided to explain the origin of an unusually large secondary 14C KIE at the carboxylate carbon of CMP-NeuAc. "
"Amino proton exchange with water could be a useful probe of nucleic acid structure and kinetics. This requires an understanding of exchange processes in the mononucleosides, which has been only partial up till now. We investigate these processes by nuclear magnetization transfer in cytidine, cAMP, cGMP, and endocyclic-methylated derivatives. From the effect of pH on the exchange rate, we disentangle the exchange processes which involve the neutral nucleoside or the nucleoside protonated on an endocyclic nitrogen, and those which operate by basic catalysis (proton transfer to OH- or to water) or by acid catalysis (proton transfer from hydronium). (Cyclic AMP) At basic pH, the amino proton transfers from the neutral nucleoside to OH-. Between pH 7 and pH 5, it transfers from the endocyclic-protonated nucleoside to water. Endocyclic protonation lowers the deprotonation pK of the amino group by about 9 units. This is confirmed by the effect of proton acceptors such as ammonia on amino proton exchange. Below pH 5, another process sets in. By reference to proton exchange in primary amides, we identify it tentatively as acid catalysis by transfer from hydronium to the amino group of the neutral nucleoside. A protonation pK of \xe2\x88\x926 is derived. (Cytidine) At basic pH, amino proton exchange proceeds by transfer from the neutral nucleoside to OH-. Below pH 6, the amino proton transfers from endocyclic-protonated cytidine to OH- (pH >4) or to water (pH <4). As in cyclic AMP, endocyclic protonation lowers the deprotonation pK of the amino group by about 9 units. Acid catalysis is not observed. (Cyclic GMP) At basic pH, the amino proton transfers from the neutral nucleoside to OH-. Endocyclic protonation (at N7) does not accelerate exchange. This indicates that it has only a weak effect on the deprotonation pK of the amino group, an explanation supported by the lack of an effect of proton acceptors such as ammonia on amino proton exchange. Below pH 6, exchange is acid-catalyzed as it is in cAMP. A protonation pK of \xe2\x88\x926.3 is derived. Similar processes occur in the methylated derivatives. In 7-methylguanosine, there are two base-catalyzed and two acid-catalyzed exchange processes. In all cases, a quantitative description of the exchange rates is obtained. Application to base-paired oligonucleotides is discussed briefly. "
"We report the first measurements of the activation barrier for ground state trans\xe2\x88\x92cis isomerization of secondary amides. We measured activation barriers of Ea = 13.8 \xc2\xb1 0.8 kcal/mol for aqueous solutions of N-methylacetamide (NMA) and Ea = 11.0 \xc2\xb1 0.7 kcal/mol for glycylglycine (Gly-Gly). These activation barriers were determined from the temperature dependence of the ground state isomerization rates, which were measured by using UV resonance Raman to monitor the relative populations of the cis and trans amides as the sample solutions were translated through a 206.5 nm CW laser beam. Photon absorption causes the normally trans form to isomerize to the cis form. We developed a photochemical model to relate the measured relative Raman intensities to the ground state isomerization rates. We also measured the photochemical isomerization quantum yields, the yields for photochemical degradation, and the cis and trans Raman cross sections and their molar absorptivities. We also measured the temperature dependence of the cis and trans Raman intensities to determine the Gibbs free energy gap between the ground state cis and trans forms of NMA (2.6 \xc2\xb1 0.4 kcal/mol) and Gly-Gly (3.1 \xc2\xb1 0.5 kcal/mol).

"The application of a new solid-state NMR technique, total through-bond correlation spectroscopy, and of an improved scheme for total through-space correlation spectroscopy to structure determination in organic solids is explored. Both experimental techniques are employed under high-resolution conditions using magic-angle sample spinning (MAS). The results from a test sample (calcium acetate monohydrate) show that through-space and through-bond connectivities can be probed separately. The information contained in the two experiments is complementary and the combination of both results can lead to improved structure determination schemes in biomolecular and material-science applications.

"The design, synthesis, and characterization of two disulfide cross-linked intramolecular pyr\xc2\xb7pur\xe2\x88\x92pyr triple helices (IV and V) is presented. Placement of a covalent cross-link from the Hoogsteen strand to the Watson\xe2\x88\x92Crick duplex produces two fundamental changes in the cross-linked DNAs relative to the parent sequence. First, formation of the cross-link results in an increase in the apparent pKa of the Hoogsteen cytosines by 1.5 pKa units (to 8.6 and 8.3 for IV and V, respectively) with a concomitant increase in thermal stability of \xe2\x88\xbc40 \xc2\xb0C at pH 7.4. Second, the cross-link enforces the triplex structure over a wide range of solution conditions, including those that are physiologically relevant (e.g., pH 7.4, 155 mM Na+, 37 \xc2\xb0C). CD and NMR measurements indicate that the cross-link does not significantly perturb the geometry of IV and V relative to their unmodified counterpart. Because the disulfide cross-link effectively prevents conformational heterogeneity associated with pyr\xc2\xb7pur\xe2\x88\x92pyr triple helices containing C+\xc2\xb7G\xe2\x88\x92C base-triplets at neutral pH, constructs possessing this modification can serve as model systems to examine the structural and thermodynamic aspects of triplex formation in vitro and to aid in the development of sequences that bind with higher affinity and specificity. "
"A generic method is reported for the assembly of multi-peptide polymers in which peptides are synthesized in the solid phase, the N-terminal residue acryloylated, and the derivitized peptides cleaved, purified and finally polymerized by free radical induced polymerization. The high molecular weight polymers generated in this way have individual peptides pendant from a backbone support. Incorporation of 6-aminohexanoyl or other residue(s) at the N-terminus of the peptide prior to acryloylation allows the peptide to be distanced from the polymer backbone and incorporation of acryloylated reagents into the polymerization mixture also permits distancing of pendant peptides along the length of the backbone support. The polymerization process results in highly antigenic artificial proteins as measured by ELISA. Because this approach allows the incorporation of the same or combinations of different purified peptides into polymers, it lends itself to the assembly of potential vaccine candidates containing epitopes from single or multiple pathogens into a single covalent structure. "
"Ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular dynamics (MD) methods have been used to study the catalytic mechanism of aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA)-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide bond. QM active-site models were used to calculate the reaction sequences of the acylation and deacylation parts of the catalytic reaction at the MP2/6-31G*//HF/6-31G* level. MD simulations, in which the structures of the active sites were constrained to the geometries obtained from the QM model calculations, were carried out for all the species of the reaction sequence. Structural information from the MD simulations was used in the subsequent QM calculations in which the charge distribution of the protein environment and solvent was included as a set of atomic point charges. These QM calculations provided an estimate of the effects of the protein environment on the energetics of the catalytic reaction. The reaction mechanism was also simulated using a continuum model for the aqueous solvent, in order to differentiate general stabilization of polar and ionic groups from specific stabilization by enzyme groups. Using the results of our QM and MD simulations, we present a detailed mechanism of AGA-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions. The catalytic mechanism of AGA was found to be similar to the well-known mechanism of serine proteases. A novel feature of the mechanism of AGA is that AGA uses O\xce\xb3 of N-terminal threonine as a nucleophile and the \xce\xb1-amino group of the terminus as a base in the catalytic reaction. These calculations showed that the protein environment differentially stabilizes the transition states of the reaction. The key transition state-stabilizing residues were Asp47, Lys207, and Arg211. Water molecules made a large contribution to the stabilization of the deacylation part of the reaction. In addition, we discuss how the catalytic nucleophile is activated in the case of AGA and other enzymes with similar catalytic machineries. "
"The photophysical properties of homopolymers (2) and block copolymers (3) prepared by ring-opening metathesis polymerization of norbornenes substituted with benzophenone, naphthalene, and phenanthrene groups (1) have been investigated. When benzophenone is attached to this polynorbornene backbone, its excited state behavior differs from that observed for monomeric benzophenone. A new intramolecular excited state complex can be observed in the transient absorption and emission measurements of the benzophenone-substituted homopolymer. In copolymers bearing benzophenone and naphthalene or phenanthrene substituent blocks, triplet energy transfer from the sensitizer (benzophenone) to the arene is observed. This energy transfer dominates over the intramolecular complexation that characterizes group interactions in the homopolymer. "
"The title compound (4) was synthesized, and its crystalline structure was determined. The molecule has C3v point symmetry and crystallizes in the trigonal space group R3m. Crystal data for 4:\xe2\x80\x89 a = 16.6710(13) \xc3\x85, b = 16.6710(13) \xc3\x85, c = 4.2590(3) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb1 = \xce\xb2 = 90\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb3 = 120\xc2\xb0, Z = 3, R(F) = 0.0234. The material has a permanent polarization and consequent pyroelectric properties. The room temperature pyroelectric coefficient was found to be \xe2\x88\x923 \xc2\xb1 2 \xce\xbcC m-2 K-1, which is in accordance with a calculated value of \xe2\x88\x923.2 \xce\xbcC m-2 K-1. The molecular dipole moment was determined to be 3.3 \xc2\xb1 0.2 D, the direction of which was unambiguously assigned with respect to the molecular coordinates. The thermal expansivity was determined at temperatures in the range \xe2\x88\x9293 to 200 \xc2\xb0C. The relative dielectric permittivity tensor was obtained at optical frequencies (\xce\xb511 and \xce\xb522 = 3.16 and \xce\xb533 = 2.48) and in the microwave region at 35 GHz (\xce\xb511 and \xce\xb522 = 5.2 \xc2\xb1 0.6 and \xce\xb533 = 2.9 \xc2\xb1 0.2), and at low frequencies (120 Hz and 1 kHz), the isotropic permittivity was determined (\xce\xb5120\xe2\x80\x89Hz = 4.7 \xc2\xb1 0.8 and \xce\xb51\xe2\x80\x89kHz = 4.7 \xc2\xb1 1.1). Finally, an estimate of the molecular heat capacity was calculated (Cp = 900 J Kg-1 K-1) and the material was considered for potential use in infrared detection as its detectivity merit factor, Mr, was determined (Mr = 8.8 \xc3\x97 10-2 m2 C-1).

"Solvolysis of the R,R and R,S isomers 2a-X and 2b-X, respectively, (X = I, Br, OBs) in 25 vol % acetonitrile in water gives the elimination products 4, 5a, and 5b along with the substitution products 2a-OH, 2b-OH, 2a-NHCOMe, and 2b-NHCOMe. The rates of elimination (kE) increase with increasing acidity of the \xce\xb2-hydrogen of the substrate as expressed by a Br\xc3\xb8nsted parameter of \xce\xb1 = 0.08 and 0.07 for the iodides and the bromides, respectively. In contrast, the brosylates, which give much smaller fractions of the stable alkenes, exhibit a negative Br\xc3\xb8nsted parameter for the elimination, \xce\xb1 = \xe2\x88\x920.10. This shows that the brosylates, in contrast to the halides, do not give elimination exclusively by a solvent-promoted E1cB reaction or an E2 reaction with a large component of hydron transfer in the transition state and indicates a large amount of reaction through carbocation intermediates to give stable alkenes. "
"Solvolysis of 9-(N-chloro-N-methylamino)fluorene (1-Cl) in 25 vol % acetonitrile in water gives the imine fluorenylidenemethylamine (3) as the sole product. The kinetic deuterium isotope effect was measured with the deuterated analogue (9-2H)-9-(N-chloro-N-methylamino)fluorene as kH/kD = 4.8 \xc2\xb1 0.2 (50 \xc2\xb0C) without base and kH/kD = 6.7 \xc2\xb1 0.2 (25 \xc2\xb0C) with hydroxide anion. The solvent- and base-promoted reactions of 1-Cl are concluded to be of E2 type. The corresponding substrates 9-(N-4-Y-benzenesulfonyl-N-methylamino)fluorene (2-Y, Y = OMe, Me, or Br), with very poor leaving groups, show reversible E1cB reactions with added bases. The strongly activated substrate 9-(N-4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl-N-methylamino)fluorene (2-NO2) does not give any elimination; it exclusively undergoes intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution involving rate-limiting hydron transfer.

"The condensation of diisopropyl squarate and related cyclobutene-1,2-diones with 2 equiv of the same alkenyl anion or 1 equiv each of two different alkenyl anions can be a very effective method for the highly stereocontrolled synthesis of di-, tri-, and tetraquinanes. Two reaction cascades have been identified. The most prevalent and often exclusive reaction course is triggered by trans 1,2-addition of the two nucleophiles. Two consecutive conrotatory processes subsequently arise to deliver a doubly charged eight-membered ring intermediate, protonation of which leads to transannular adolization. The second option begins with cis 1,2-addition, this event triggering structural reorganization via a dianionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. When the alkenyl anions are sufficiently substituted, the two pathways are distinguishable on stereochemical grounds. A minor pathway consisting of trans 1,4-addition is seen to operate in certain contexts, especially when the alkenyllithium is \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d. Acetylide anions can also be utilized successfully; in such cases, the benefit of regiocontrolled protonation surfaces and gives rise to a single product. Other aspects of these complex tandem reactions have been investigated and are discussed. "
"The stereoselectivity associated with the coaddition of a chiral and an achiral cycloalkenyl anion to a squarate ester has been examined. The selective formation of polycyclic ketones is observed in all cases, although dual protonation at both of the available enolate sites in their penultimate cyclooctatrienyl dianion precursors was sometimes noted. Proof that the stereoselection was the result of interconversion between a pair of helical octatetraene intermediates, with resultant erosion of original stereogenicity, was established by isolation of diastereomeric monoadducts and separate submission of these hydroxy cyclobutenones to the original reaction conditions. The final stages of the cascade proceed via the lower energy transition state option where nonbonded steric effects are skirted as much as possible. These features are coordinated with subsequent stereocontrolled trans/annular aldol reactions during the quenching process. The adherence to these mechanistic guidelines is so all-encompassing that product stereochemistry can be reliably predicted from the outset. "
"The thermodynamics of interaction of (R)- and (S)-propranolol between an acetic acid buffer (pH = 4.7 and 5.5) and the protein cellobiohydrolase I immobilized on silica gel was studied between 5 and 45 \xc2\xb0C. The equilibrium data were fitted to a biLangmuir adsorption isotherm with excellent agreement. One of the two Langmuir contributions is the same for both enantiomers and accounts for the nonspecific interactions between these compounds and most sites on the surfaces (type-I, nonselective sites). It has a large saturation capacity. The second contribution accounts for the chiral selective interactions (type-II sites). It has a lower monolayer capacity than the first. The interaction enthalpy and entropy on type-I sites are \xe2\x88\x921.1 kcal/mol and +0.1 cal/(mol K), respectively. For type-II sites, they are \xe2\x88\x921.9 kcal/mol and \xe2\x88\x922.6 cal/(mol K), respectively, for (R)-propranolol and +1.6 kcal/mol and + 11.6 cal/(mol K), respectively, for (S)-propranolol at pH = 5.5. This explains why at this pH the retention time of the less-retained R enantiomer decreases with increasing temperature, while the retention time of the S enantiomer increases, causing a large increase of the separation factor when the temperature is raised from 5 to 45 \xc2\xb0C. The saturation capacity of the chiral contributions depends strongly on the pH, and the retention times of both enantiomers decrease with increasing temperature at pH = 4.7. "
"High diastereoselection in a samarium(II) iodide-promoted ketyl-olefin cyclization reaction has been achieved using tartramide-derived keto allylic acetals as chiral auxiliaries. The unique features of the reaction include the fact that remote diastereoselection is achieved in a radical process and that high levels of stereochemical induction are observed at both new stereocenters created in the transformation. The source of the asymmetric induction is postulated to be a highly ordered, tricyclic transition structure made possible by three-point chelation between the ketyl intermediate and the samarium counterion. As such, this transformation also demonstrates the first example of the use of a chelating metal to affect high levels of remote asymmetric induction in a radical reaction. Because of this chelation, the sense of relative stereoselectivity is unusual for a SmI2-mediated cyclization, providing consistently high ratios of cis/trans isomers. A double-diastereodifferentiating experiment provides additional support for this mechanistic hypothesis. The preparation of enantiomerically enriched cyclopentanediols and -lactols can be achieved through this novel asymmetric cyclization protocol. "
"Lanosterol synthase [(S)-2,3-epoxysqualene mutase (cyclizing, lanosterol forming), EC 5.4.99.7], the enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae which catalyzes the complex cyclization/rearrangement step in sterol biosynthesis, was overexpressed in baculovirus-infected cells and purified to homogeneity in three steps. Using pure enzyme the kinetics of cyclization were determined using Michaelis\xe2\x88\x92Menten analysis for 2,3-oxidosqualene (1) and two analogs in which the C\xe2\x88\x926 methyl was replaced by H (3) or Cl (4). The measured Vmax/KM ratios for 1, 3, and 4 were found to be 138, 9.4, and 21.9, respectively, a clear indication that oxirane cleavage and cyclization to form the A-ring are concerted, since the nucleophilicity of the proximate double bond influences the rate of oxirane cleavage. No catalytic metal ions could be detected in purified lanosterol synthase by atomic absorption analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of each of the six strongly conserved aspartic acid residues (D \xe2\x86\x92 N mutation) and each of the nine conserved glutamic acid residues (E \xe2\x86\x92 Q) revealed that only one, D456, is essential for catalytic function of the enzyme. The essential D456 residue is a likely candidate for electrophilic (specifically protic) activation of the oxirane function. "
"Four 2,3-oxidosqualene analogs, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which are irreversible, time-dependent inhibitors of the enzyme lanosterol synthase, were found to attach covalently within the 231\xe2\x88\x92236 (yeast numbering) segment (Figure 3). The attachment was determined by tryptic digestion of the inactivated enzyme, separation of the tryptic cleavage products by C18 reverse phase HPLC, and fragment identification by mass spectroscopy or Edman degradation. W232 and H234 are the targets of the chemical inactivation by cations derived from analogs 3\xe2\x88\x926. 2,3-Oxidosqualene analogs 7, 8, and 9 inactivated the enzyme with covalent attachment to the 486\xe2\x88\x92512 segment (Figure 3), which is in a domain that is predicted to be an amphipathic \xce\xb1-helix. Site-directed mutagenesis of various amino acid residues (76 total) in lanosterol synthase which are conserved in five different species has revealed that residues D456, H146, and H234 are essential for catalytic activity. These and other data permit the formulation of a hypothetical working model of some aspects of the activation and binding of 2,3-oxidosqualene by lanosterol synthase. The model is depicted in Figure 4. In that model D456 and protonated H146 initiate cyclization, and the domains containing 231\xe2\x88\x92236 and 486\xe2\x88\x92512 make contact with the reacting substrate. "
"Magnetic coupling constants (2J) of hydroxo- and alkoxo-bridged copper binuclear compounds have been evaluated to determine the accuracy of different density functional methods and to study the magnetic behavior of these compounds. Comparison between the calculated and experimental coupling constants for the complete structures of five compounds shows that the most successful computational strategy is the combination of the B3LYP method with the broken-symmetry approach. Calculations for model compounds of both families yield reasonable approximations to the values of magnetic coupling constants calculated for the full molecular structures. Our calculations show a correlation between the magnetic coupling constant and the Cu\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92Cu bridging angle and with the out-of-plane displacement of the hydroxo or alkoxo groups, in agreement with the experimental data. The counterions of the hydroxo-bridged complexes, when hydrogen bonded to the bridging hydroxo group, determine the extent of the out-of-plane displacement of its hydrogen atom and strongly influence the sign and magnitude of the magnetic interaction. The energy gap between the two singly occupied molecular orbitals is shown to determine the changes in the value of 2J for small structural variations. "
"Silica hydrogel (glass) was doped with native (iron-containing) cytochrome c and with its zinc derivative. Ultraviolet\xe2\x88\x92visible, circular dichroism, and resonance Raman spectra of both proteins and the lifetime of the triplet state of the zinc protein show that encapsulation in the sol-gel glass only slightly perturbs the polypeptide backbone and does not detectably perturb the heme group. Because thermal (ground-state) redox reactions of the encapsulated native cytochrome c are very slow, we take advantage of the transparency of the silica to study, by laser flash spectrometry, photoinduced (excited-state) redox reactions of zinc cytochrome c, which occur in milliseconds. The triplet state, 3Zncyt, is oxidatively quenched by [Fe(CN)6]3-, dioxygen, and p-benzoquinone. These reactions are monophasic in bulk solutions but biphasic in solutions confined in glass. Changes in ionic strength and pH differently affect the kinetics in these two environments. Adsorption of cytochrome c, which is positively charged, to the pore walls, which are negatively charged at pH 7.0, affects the kinetics in the doped glass. Exclusion of the [Fe(CN)6]3- anions from the glass interior also affects the kinetics. Even at equilibrium the anion concentration is lower inside the glass than in the external solution. This exclusion can be lessened or eliminated by raising ionic strength and lowering the pH value. The electroneutral quenchers are not excluded from the glass. Diffusion of all three quenchers is slower in the confined solution than in the bulk solution, as expected. The smaller the molecule, the lesser this hindrance by the glass matrix. In light of these findings, the assumption that porosity of sol-gel glasses ensures uniform penetration of relatively small molecules into the pores must be taken skeptically and tested for each solute (or analyte) of interest, especially for the charged ones. These considerations are important in the design of sensors. "
"The magnetic properties of the layered vanadyl phosphonates (LVPs) VO(O3PC6H4\xe2\x88\x92X)\xc2\xb7nH2O (X = p-NO2, m-F, p-Cl, p-F, H, p-CH3) have been investigated. In the isostructural n = 1 series (X = p-NO2, m-F, p-F, H), the paramagnetic d1 vanadyl centers are coupled via the O\xe2\x88\x92P\xe2\x88\x92O pathways of V(OPO)2V chair-like subunits. The magnetic properties of these LVPs can be systematically controlled by modification of the P atom\'s electronic environment via variations of the X group in the aryl pendant. The simple paramagnetism of the LVP featuring the strong electron withdrawing substituent X = p-NO2 gives way to increasing antiferromagnetic coupling between the VIV centers as the electron-donating ability of X is increased. Consistent with a chair-like V(OPO)2V exchange pathway between pairs of vanadyl centers, the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility data fit a Bleaney\xe2\x88\x92Bowers dimer model. When the substituent is large, as is the case for the p-Cl and p-CH3 species, a structurally different class of LVPs is obtained, in which n = 1.5. In this case, the contribution of the O\xe2\x88\x92P\xe2\x88\x92O linkage is overwhelmed by the presence of the more direct exchange pathway of vanadyl centers through \xce\xbc2-bridging oxygens of a V(\xce\xbc2-O)2V dimer, obviating the effects of electronic variations in the phosphonate bridge. Our results show that magnetic coupling correlates with a simple measure of electronic perturbation of the exchange pathway in LVPs, implying that such interactions can be tuned using the traditional tools of physical organic chemistry.

"Oxidative addition reactions of a quinone with the sulfur containing cyclic chlorophosphine S[(t-Bu)MeC6H2O]2PCl (1) yielded the new bicyclic tetraoxyphosphoranes, S[(t-Bu)MeC6H2O]2PCl(O2C6Cl4) (2) and S[(t-Bu)MeC6H2O]2PCl(O2C14H8) (5). Further new derivatives of this class were prepared by chlorine displacement reactions of 2 and 5 to give S[(t-Bu)MeC6H2O]2P(NHC6H4Me)(O2C6Cl4) (3), S[(t-Bu)MeC6H2O]2P(NMe2)(O2C6Cl4) (4), S[(t-Bu)MeC6H2O]2P(NHCH2C6H5)(O2C14H8) (6), and S[(t-Bu)MeC6H2O]2P(NMe2)(O2C14H8) (7). X-ray studies of 2\xe2\x88\x926 revealed hexacoordination due to donor action by sulfur which is present as part of an eight-membered ring system. The series 2\xe2\x88\x926 formed geometries that were displaced along a coordinate from a square pyramid to an octahedron, ranging from 24% to 71%. The respective P\xe2\x88\x92S distance decreased along this series from 3.04 to 2.48 \xc3\x85 as the octahedral character increased. Increased 31P NMR shielding accompanied the chloro derivatives 2 and 5, while increased \xcf\x80 P\xe2\x88\x92N back-bonding resulted in the least shielded members 4, 6, and 7 containing the less electronegative nitrogen atom. These changes in 31P chemical shift correlate with the extent of octahedral character where the more shielded phosphorus atom has the greater octahedral character. The analysis allows a lower limit in the phosphorus atom electrophilicity to be established that will allow hexacoordination in this series of bicyclic tetraoxyphosphoranes provided by a variation in ligand properties.

"Echo-detected FT-EPR spectra have been observed for the quinone anion radical generated from the photoexcitation of duroquinone (DQ) in the presence of N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA) and its monohalogen substituents in 1-propanol. When DMA and 4-Cl DMA were used as the electron donor, the net-emissive polarization due to a triplet mechanism was observed. In contrast, the electron donors of 4-BrDMA and 4-IDMA gave unusual net-absorptive (A) CIDEP spectra of the DQ anion radical at the delay time of 200 ns between the laser and first microwave pulses. It was found that the enhancement factor of the net-A polarization remarkably depends on the heavy atom position in the donor. The net-A polarization observed is attributable to a spin\xe2\x88\x92orbit coupling mechanism (SOCM). Simple explicit expressions have been given for the electron spin polarization generation due to SOCM. "
"The cyclic pentapeptide cyclo(-Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Val-) is a highly potent and selective inhibitor for the \xce\xb1v\xce\xb23 integrin and is a prospective anticancer drug by acting to inhibit angiogenesis and by inducing apoptosis in vascular cells. The cyclic retro-inverso peptides as well as the inverso and the cyclic retro peptide analogs of the four cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Val peptides with one amino acid in the d configuration and the corresponding all-l peptide have been synthesized. The inhibitory activities of 18 compounds have been tested on the isolated integrin \xce\xb1IIb\xce\xb23 and \xce\xb1v\xce\xb23 receptors. The conformations of the cyclic retro-inverso pentapeptides were investigated by NMR spectroscopy using NOEs, ROEs, and coupling constants and were determined by distance geometry (DG) calculations. The structures were compared to their parent analogs, and the relationship between their conformation and the biological activity is discussed. Due to the reversal of the peptide bonds in the retro-inverso peptides, the hydrogen bond pattern is shifted and the spatial structure differs from its parent compound structure. These conformational changes result in a dramatic decrease of activity in comparison to the high-active parent peptides. On the other hand the retro-inverso peptide analog of the poorly active parent peptide cyclo(-d-Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Val-) was found to be highly active and selective for the \xce\xb1v\xce\xb23 receptor. Furthermore, the almost perfect similarity of the side chain orientation between the highly active peptide cyclo(-Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Val-) and the inactive retro-inverso peptide cyclo(-Val-d-Phe-d-Asp-Gly-d-Arg-) indicates a distinct interaction of at least one peptide bond of the backbone with the \xce\xb1v\xce\xb23 receptor.

"A molecular dynamics study and solution-phase 1H and 13C chemical shift anisotropy determination of a symmetric cryogenic disaccharide, \xce\xb1,\xce\xb1-trehalose, has been performed in a temperature range between 264 and 350 K. Negligible temperature dependence of proton\xe2\x88\x92carbon couplings of the asymmetrically [1-13C]-labeled trehalose suggest that the averaged conformation of the interglycosidic linkage is centered around dihedral angles \xcf\x86 = \xcf\x88 = \xe2\x88\x9241\xc2\xb0 with \xc2\xb15\xc2\xb0 uncertainty. Homonuclear NOE-s in the labeled trehalose support the dominance of similar conformation. Close to the slow and fast motional regime, \xce\xb1,\xce\xb1-trehalose can be considered as a spherical top, and global correlation times can be determined easily at extreme temperatures. This allows the construction of an Arrhenius plot for the whole range of temperature. The approach, which we call \xe2\x80\x9ctrouble-free\xe2\x80\x9d, yields Ea = 28.2 kJ/mol for the activation energy of molecular reorientation. The model-free analysis of 13C T1, T2, and NOE data showed a local maximum of the generalized order parameters with S2 = 0.9 around 273 K. Monte-Carlo error analysis corroborated that this effect could be real; however, effective correlation times have relatively high error limits. Thermodynamically, the S2 data can be interpreted in terms of changes in the Gibbs free energy due to increased or diminished spatial restriction of rapid CH fluctuations. Liquid state 1H and 13C chemical shift anisotropies were determined from the interference of dipole\xe2\x88\x92dipole and chemical shift anisotropy relaxation. In solution, chemical shift anisotropies cannot be separated from an inherent geometrical factor, so a combined CSAg factor was used. Cross-correlated spectral densities could be well fitted for the C-1,H-1 vector over the entire temperature range with the \xe2\x80\x9ctrouble-free\xe2\x80\x9d global correlation times. The resulting numerical values for CSAg were smaller compared to the model-free evaluation, due to the omission of internal fluctuations. The measured shift anisotropies were found to be independent from the selection of isotropic or anisotropic dynamical models. Apparent CSAg factors were nearly constant in the entire temperature range except C-3, H-2, and H-3. Comparison with deuterium labeled [2,4,6-2H]trehalose proved that temperature-induced changes of the ABX-type strong coupling pattern (caused by the change of differential chemical shift of vicinal H-2 and H-3 protons) interfere with asymmetric multiplet relaxation and potentially lead to misinterpretation of CSA/DD relaxation rates.

"Pyrolysis products of propylenimine have been investigated by gas electron diffraction aided by mass spectrometry. Propylenimine vapor was heated in a quartz tube and effused into the diffraction chamber through a nozzle kept at room temperature. When the temperature of the quartz tube was 470 \xc2\xb0C, propylenimine completely transformed into syn- and anti-CH3\xe2\x88\x92NH\xe2\x88\x92CHCH2 (N-methylvinylamine) and trans-CH3\xe2\x88\x92NCH\xe2\x88\x92CH3 (N-methylethylidenimine), all of which are short-lived species. Geometrical structures and mole fractions of these species were determined from electron diffraction data combined with the results of ab initio calculations. The principal structural parameters of syn-CH3\xe2\x88\x92NH\xe2\x88\x92CHCH2 are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 rg(N\xe2\x88\x92Cvinyl) = 1.391(3) \xc3\x85; rg(N-Cmethyl) = 1.465(3) \xc3\x85; rg(CC) = 1.343(4) \xc3\x85; \xe2\x88\xa0\xce\xb1CNC = 119.5(9)\xc2\xb0; \xe2\x88\xa0\xce\xb1NCC = 126.5(7)\xc2\xb0. Those of anti-CH3\xe2\x88\x92NH\xe2\x88\x92CHCH2 are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 rg(N-Cvinyl) = 1.395 \xc3\x85; rg(N-Cmethyl) = 1.472 \xc3\x85 ; rg(CC) = 1.341 \xc3\x85; \xe2\x88\xa0\xce\xb1CNC = 118.4\xc2\xb0; \xe2\x88\xa0\xce\xb1NCC = 126.1\xc2\xb0. Those of trans-CH3\xe2\x88\x92NCH\xe2\x88\x92CH3 are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 rg(NC) = 1.278 \xc3\x85; rg(N\xe2\x88\x92C) = 1.472 \xc3\x85; rg(C\xe2\x88\x92C) = 1.511 \xc3\x85; \xe2\x88\xa0\xce\xb1CNC = 118.0\xc2\xb0; \xe2\x88\xa0\xce\xb1NCC = 121.4\xc2\xb0. Parenthesized values are the estimated limits of error (3\xcf\x83) referring to the last significant digit. No error estimation is given for dependent parameters. The determined mole fractions of syn- and anti-NMVA and trans-NMEI are 0.63(7), 0.28(8), and 0.09(4), respectively. The experimental data of electron diffraction obtained at 530 \xc2\xb0C could best be reproduced by partial inclusion (about 30%) of decomposition products such as ketenimine and methane. The reaction path has been discussed on the basis of the temperature dependence of the amount of the unstable species. "
"The 351-nm photoelectron spectrum of the negative ion of 1,3-benzoquinodimethane (m-xylylene) is reported. Features are observed in the photoelectron spectrum corresponding to formation of the 3B2, 1A1, and 1B2 states of m-xylylene. The electron affinity of the triplet ground state is found to be 0.919 \xc2\xb1 0.008 eV, and vibrational frequencies of 290, 540, and 1500 cm-1 are obtained. The active modes are assigned to \xce\xb1-carbon bending, ring deformation, and methylene bending, respectively. The 1A1 state is found to lie 9.6 \xc2\xb1 0.2 kcal/mol higher in energy than the ground state, in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Vibrational frequencies of 265, 1000, and 1265 cm-1 are found for this state. The 1B2 is estimated to be <21.5 kcal/mol higher in energy than the ground state. Density functional calculations have been carried out on the negative ion, indicating that the 2B1 ion is a minimum on the potential energy surface, lying 2.9 kcal/mol lower in energy than the 2A2 ion, which is a transition state.

"We present a study of the torsional potential of biisothianaphthene and compare it to that of bithiophene. The calculations are performed at the ab initio and semiempirical Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock (HF), ab initio post-Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock, and density functional theory (DFT) levels. Our study has two major aims:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) on the physico-chemical side, to asses the optimal conformation of biisothianaphthene and evaluate the rotational barriers toward coplanar structures and (ii) on the methodological side, to asses the usefulness of DFT approaches. In contrast to previous estimates, the torsional potential of biisothianaphthene is found to differ markedly from that of bithiophene. For biisothianaphthene, strongly rotated s-cis- and s-trans-gauche minima are predicted as the most stable structures. The structural analysis fully justifies the greater stability of the s-cis-gauche conformer, thus explaining the \xe2\x80\x9cunexpected\xe2\x80\x9d s-cis-like structure observed experimentally in the crystal. The attainment of planar conformations is prevented by the high rotational barriers:\xe2\x80\x89 \xe2\x88\xbc22 kJ/mol (s-trans) and \xe2\x88\xbc63 kJ/mol (s-cis) at the MP2 level. Aromatic polyisothianaphthene chains are therefore predicted to be highly distorted from planarity even in the solid state, which is of importance with regard to their electronic and optical properties. DFT calculations are shown to provide geometries very close to those obtained at the MP2 level, but fail in describing the energetics of the torsional potentials because they overstabilize planar conformers. The results allow us to propose a very efficient computational approach for reliable determinations of conformational potentials in conjugated compounds. The poor quality of the potentials provided by semiempirical HF methods is emphasized. "
"The naphthylcarbene potential energy surface (PES) was examined ab initio, employing self-consistent field (SCF), second-order perturbation theory (MP2), and density functional (Becke3LYP) methods in conjunction with 6-31G*, DZ, DZP, and 6-311+G* basis sets. All stationary structures were characterized by vibrational frequency analyses at the Becke3LYP/6-31G* level; final energies were evaluated at the Becke3LYP/6-311+G*//Becke3LYP/6-31G* + ZPVE level. Cyclobuta[de]naphthalene is the global minimum on this part of the C11H8 PES. Generally, seven-membered benzocarbenes are no minima as they converge to their corresponding allenes. Both 1- and 2-naphthylcarbene have triplet ground states, but the small S\xe2\x88\x92T gaps (ca. 5 kcal mol-1) allow facile rearrangements in the singlet manifold to take place. The triplet rotational barrier for the exo-methylene in 2-naphthylcarbene is relatively small (3.5 kcal mol-1) due to weak \xcf\x80-bonding. At low temperatures, singlet 2-naphthylcarbene equilibrates with 2,3-benzobicyclo[4.1.0]hepta-2,4,6-triene and bicycloheptatetra-1,3,5,7-ene, but not with 4,5-benzocycloheptatrienylidene which is not a minimum; rearrangement to singlet 1-naphthylcarbene occurs only at higher temperatures via bicycloheptatetra-1,2,4,6-ene, the second lowest minimum. As the rearrangement barriers from 1- and 2-naphthylcarbene to bicycloheptatetra-1,2,4,6-ene are of similar magnitude (\xce\x94\xce\x94E\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 1.9 kcal mol-1), the latter species may be observed in small quantities only. The allenes bicycloheptatetra-1,2,4,6-ene, bicycloheptatetra-1,3,5,7-ene, and bicycloheptatetra-2,3,5,7-ene are thermodynamically remarkably stable and should be observable at low temperatures. "
"The rearrangement of singlet phenylnitrene (1a) to 1-azacyclohepta-1,2,4,6-tetraene (3a) has been studied computationally, using the CASSCF and CASPT2N methods in conjunction with the 6-31G*, cc-pVDZ, and 6-311G(2d,p) basis sets. Ring expansion from the 1A2 state of 1a is predicted to occur in two steps via 7-azabicyclo[4.1.0]hepta-2,4,6-triene (2a) as an intermediate. The rearrangement of 1a to 2a is estimated to have a barrier of ca. 6 kcal/mol and to be rate-determining. Azirine 2a is unlikely to be detected, because of the small calculated barrier (ca. 3 kcal/mol) to its rearrangement to 3a. At the CASPT2N/6-311G(2d,p)//CASSCF(8,8)/6-31G* + ZPE level of theory, the reaction 1a \xe2\x86\x92 3a on the lowest singlet potential energy surface is calculated to be exothermic by 1.6 kcal/mol. This reaction is predicted to be ca. 19 kcal/mol less exothermic, but to have a barrier ca. 9 kcal/mol lower than the analogous ring expansion of 1A\xe2\x80\x98 phenylcarbene (1b) to cyclohepta-1,2,4,6-tetraene (3b). Factors which contribute to these and other energetic differences between the ring expansion reactions of 1a and 1b are discussed. The lowest singlet state of planar 1-azacyclohepta-1,3,5-trien-7-ylidene (4a) is an open-shell singlet (11A\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98), which is calculated to be ca. 20 kcal/mol above 3a and to be the transition state for enantiomerization of 3a. Unlike cycloheptatrienylidene (4b), 4a is predicted to have a triplet ground state and an energy difference between 11A\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 and the lowest triplet (13A\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98) of ca. 1 kcal/mol. The similar geometries of and small adiabatic energy difference between these two states of 4a is probably the reason why triplet 4a has not been detected by EPR. "
"Three-substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl radicals (5), generated from additions of radicals to [1.1.1]propellane (1), are found to have high propensities to react with three-coordinate phosphorus molecules. For example, the 3-ethylbicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl radical (5d) reacts with (EtO)3P in a free-radical Arbuzov process to yield dimethyl 3-ethylbicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-ylphosphonate (13). By contrast, the ethyl radical does not react with (EtO)3P to yield EtP(O)(OEt)2. However, the highly reactive phenyl radical yields PhP(O)(OEt)2. Moreover, attack of the n-pentylbicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl radical (5b) on n-C5H11P(OMe)2 results in a free-radical substitution process that gives dimethyl 3-n-pentyl[1.1.1]bicyclopent-1-ylphosphonite (7b) and the primary alkyl radical n-C5H11\xe2\x80\xa2. Thus, 5 has a propensity to bond to three-coordinate phosphorus that is greater than that of a primary alkyl radical and similar to that of phenyl radical. Reaction of 2-benzyl-4-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane (9) with 5a is found to proceed with predominant inversion of configuration at phosphorus. Furthermore, 3-phenylmethylbicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl radical, 5a (from reaction of benzyl radical with 1), participates in reasonably efficient radical chain reactions with PhCH2OP(OMe)2 (11) and PhCH2P(OMe)2 (6a) (chain lengths 30\xe2\x88\x9250) to provide structurally novel products of new radical-Arbuzov and radical-substitution reactions. Dimethyl 3-phenylmethylbicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-ylphosphonate (12) from 11 and dimethyl 3-phenylmethylbicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-ylphosphonite (7a) from 6a incorporate the bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl moiety. The high propensity of various 5 to react with three-coordinate phosphorus molecules reflects the highly pyramidal nature of 5 which is accompanied by the increased s-character of the SOMO orbital of 5 and the strength of the phosphorus\xe2\x88\x92carbon bond in the presumed phosphoranyl radical intermediates (3 and 4) formed. Figure 1 depicts the thermodynamics of three classes of free radical substitution and Arbuzov reactions with three-coordinate phosphorus molecules. "
"A molecular triad consisting of a diarylporphyrin (P) covalently linked to a carotenoid polyene (C) and a fullerene (C60) has been prepared and studied using time-resolved spectroscopic methods. In 2-methyltetrahydrofuran solution, the triad undergoes photoinduced electron transfer to yield C\xe2\x88\x92P\xe2\x80\xa2+\xe2\x88\x92C60\xe2\x80\xa2-, which evolves into C\xe2\x80\xa2+\xe2\x88\x92P\xe2\x88\x92C60\xe2\x80\xa2- with an overall quantum yield of 0.14. This state decays by charge recombination to yield the carotenoid triplet state with a time constant of 170 ns. Even in a glass at 77 K, C\xe2\x80\xa2+\xe2\x88\x92P\xe2\x88\x92C60\xe2\x80\xa2- is formed with a quantum yield of \xe2\x88\xbc0.10 and again decays mainly by charge recombination to give 3C\xe2\x88\x92P\xe2\x88\x92C60. The fullerene triplet, formed through normal intersystem crossing, is also observed at 77 K. The generation in the triad of a long-lived charge separated state by photoinduced electron transfer, the low-temperature electron transfer behavior, and the formation of a triplet state by charge recombination are phenomena previously observed mostly in photosynthetic reaction centers.

"Semiempirical quantum chemical calculations (AM1/CI and PM3/CI) confirm the qualitative perturbational prediction that electron-withdrawing groups on the ring nitrogen of a 3,4-dimethylenepyrrole should diminish the energy separation of the singlet and triplet states to near zero. Syntheses of a series of precursors of such biradicals have been developed. Study of the chemistry and spectroscopy of the biradicals has revealed persistent singlet states for the cases where the substituent is methyl, isobutyryl, and pivaloyl. In the cases of N-arenesulfonyl-3,4-dimethylenepyrroles, both a singlet and a triplet form can be observed as persistent species. In this paper, the properties of the singlets in this series are described. Although energy transfer from the excited triplet state of the sensitizer xanthone to the diazene precursor of N-p-toluenesulfonyl-3,4-dimethylenepyrrole is observed by nanosecond time-resolved spectroscopy, the chemical behavior of the biradical intermediate is the same as that observed in the direct photolysis or thermolysis of the diazene. The reactive form of the biradical under these conditions appears to be the singlet. "
"In contrast to the photolyses of N-methyl- or N-pivaloylpyrrolo[3,4]dihydropyridazines in low-temperature matrices, which give the blue, ESR-inactive singlet 3,4-dimethylenepyrrole biradical at all wavelengths, the photolyses of the N-arenesulfonyl derivatives in this series are strongly wavelength-dependent. In three separate instances, both singlet and triplet N-arenesulfonyl-3,4-dimethylenepyrrole biradicals have been observed. In each case, one or two other triplets are seen by ESR spectroscopy after irradiation under special conditions. These are tentatively assigned conformationally isomeric diazenyl biradical structures. The possible origins of the slow intersystem crossing rates for singlet\xe2\x88\x92triplet interconversions in N-arenesulfonyl-3,4-dimethylenepyrrole biradicals are examined. Near-zero ionic character of the singlet wave function is considered to be a less likely cause than conformational control of the spin state. The latter circumstance would require that intersystem crossing be coupled to conformational change, which can be very slow at low temperatures. The zero-field splittings determined from the ESR spectra of N-tosyl-3,4-dimethylenepyrrole biradical are found to be temperature-dependent, which could be caused by librations and/or internal rotational (conformational) motions of the biradical in the matrix. "
"Methods are described for the synthesis of bis-diazene precursors of catenated tetraradicals. Photodeazetation in a low-temperature matrix of the N-tosylpyrrole member of the series (13) gives mainly the monodeazetated biradical 34, which is characterized by its ESR spectrum as a triplet species. Determination of the absolute number of spins present and analysis of the kinetics of the photolysis show that the tetraradical 12 is present to the extent of only 0.2\xe2\x88\x920.5% of the concentration of the biradical. The spectrum of the tetraradical 12 therefore cannot be observed under these conditions, and its spin remains unknown. Photodeazetation of the bis-diazene precursor (35) in the thiophene series gives successively the green monodeazetated biradical 36 and the (also green) bis-deazetated tetraradical 11. The reactions of compound 11 with alkenes in thawed matrices and its lack of an ESR spectrum characterize the species as a singlet. The tetraradical 11 is a prototype of a nonclassical polymeric conductor. Because of the presence of \xe2\x80\x9chalf-filled\xe2\x80\x9d NBMOs, the frontier electrons of such molecules may be exceptionally conductive. "
"\xce\xb2-CuI nanocrystallites (NCs) are synthesized on the atomically smooth graphite basal plane surface using a new hybrid electrochemical/chemical (E/C) method. This method involves the following steps:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) electrochemical deposition of copper NCs onto an electrode surface, (2) electrochemical oxidation of these copper NCs to yield Cu2O, and (3) displacement of oxygen in Cu2O by iodide in an aqueous KI solution. Dispersions of CuI NCs having mean diameters ranging from 10 to 180 \xc3\x85 were prepared using the E/C method. Selected-area electron diffraction analysis reveals that \xce\xb2-CuI NCs are obtained; these NCs are epitaxially aligned with the hexagonal periodicity of the graphite surface, as are the Cu2O precursor particles. For samples of supported CuI NCs having a mean particle height of <25 \xc3\x85, individual NCs were well-separated from one another on the graphite surface and were narrowly dispersed in height. Photoluminescence spectroscopic analysis showed a strong, room temperature emission at an energy corresponding to the band gap. As the crystallite diameter was reduced from 180 \xc3\x85 to 13 \xc3\x85, the energy of this emission shifted from the macroscopic value of 2.92 eV to >3.04 eV, in good agreement with the predictions of the effective mass, strong confinement model.

"Guanine-specific modification of both single- and double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides via the autoxidation of sulfite is shown to be catalyzed by [NiCR]2+ (where CR = 2,12-dimethyl-3,7,11,17-tetraazabicyclo[11.3.1]heptadeca-1(17),2,11,13,15-pentaene) and [NiKGH-nh2]+ (where KGH = lysylglycylhistidine). In the latter case, the nickel complex is proposed to act as a catalyst in three separate steps of sulfur oxide chemistry. Oxidative damage of guanines led to strand scission after piperidine treatment. The observed reactivity represents the first demonstration of DNA damage by sulfite and nickel(II) complexes. Importantly, these reactions were conducted using sulfite concentrations relevant to levels known to be cytotoxic. Mechanistic studies suggest the importance of both monoperoxysulfate and sulfate radical anion in the observed DNA damage. Evidence for formation of guanine radical cation as the initial product of DNA oxidation was found by comparison of the sequence dependence of guanine reactivity in a duplex restriction fragment. These studies underscore a role for sulfite in nickel toxicity and suggest a new method of site-specific oxidation with bioconjugates using sulfite rather than highly reactive oxidants such as monoperoxysulfate.

"Pyruvate decarboxylase, a thiamin-diphosphate (ThDP) dependent enzyme from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SCPDC), catalyzes the conversion of fluoropyruvate to carbon dioxide, fluoride ion and acetate ion, as earlier reported for the wheat-germ enzyme (Gish, G.; Smyth, T.; Kluger, R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988, 110, 6230\xe2\x88\x926234). While the fluoropyruvate reaction with the wheat-germ enzyme does not display the sigmoidal kinetics associated with hysteretic regulation by substrate that pyruvate as substrate produces with the wheat-germ enzyme, this feature and the induction period characteristic of hysteretic regulation are preserved when fluoropyruvate acts as substrate and regulator for SCPDC. The C1\xe2\x88\x9213C kinetic isotope effect for fluoropyruvate with SCPDC is the same as that for pyruvate (1.008\xe2\x88\x921.009), indicating the decarboxylation step to be about 15% rate limiting in the substrate-binding/decarboxylation part of the reaction. Solvent isotope effects and proton inventories are consistent with the view that fluoropyruvate regulation in SCPDC is not associated with an intracatalytic opening/closing of the active site coupled to sulfhydryl addition of cysteine-221 to the regulator keto group, as is thought to occur in pyruvate regulation of SCPDC. Product-release events in the first few catalytic cycles of the fluoropyruvate reaction, involving enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetyl-ThDP and release of acetate ion, may bring the wheat-germ enzyme into an ordinarily kinetically inaccessible enzyme-conformational regime analogous to the active form of the bacterial enzyme from Zymomonas mobilis, where the active site is permanently open without occupation of the regulatory site. Binding of fluoropyruvate at the regulatory site of SCPDC, in contrast, may remain necessary in the steady state for active-enzyme function but the active site may be permanently opened, thus not requiring the intracatalytic addition\xe2\x88\x92elimination reactions at the regulatory site.

"Vancomycin is one of the most important and commonly used antibiotics in hospitals. Despite numerous investigations, however, it is not clear how vancomycin recognizes its site of action in the bacterial cell wall. The increasing incidence of bacterial resistance to vancomycin makes it imperative to understand these recognition determinants so that alternative agents may be developed. Herein we report the first crystal structure of vancomycin. The structure resolves a long-standing controversy about carboxylate recognition by vancomycin, suggests a possible cooperative mechanism linking ligand binding and dimerization, and demonstrates the operation of a novel intramolecular flap which occupies the binding site in the absence of ligand.

"Ab initio molecular orbital theory was used to examine the role of active site tyrosine in glutathione S-transferases by using appropriate model systems. The location of the key mechanistic proton of the enzyme\xe2\x88\x92glutathione binary complex, O-\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89-H-\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89-S, was predicted to be near the phenolic oxygen, which is in agreement with experiments. However, the position of the proton can be manipulated by changing the acidity of the tyrosine, which can be accomplished by either introducing a substituent group to the tyrosine phenol ring or changing the protein environment. Thus, our study seems to have resolved previous confusion as to where the proton is located. The hydrogen bonding between tyrosine and thiolate of glutathione is very strong. On the basis of our present study, we propose that, in the Y6F (Tyr \xe2\x86\x92 Phe) mutant, a water molecule replaces the function of the hydroxyl group of the active site tyrosine of the wild-type enzyme. Several lines of evidence in support of the above hypothesis are discussed. The latter hypothesis is reminiscent of the notion of substrate-assisted catalysis. "
"Previous studies have shown that \xce\xb2-lactamases are inhibited by boronates and phosphonates, both of which form covalent tetrahedral adducts with the active-site serine residue. These have been interpreted, as have similar complexes formed with serine proteinases, as transition-state analog structures. Not all molecules capable of forming such tetrahedral adducts are good inhibitors of serine \xce\xb2-lactamases, however. In this paper, a series of molecules potentially capable of forming anionic tetrahedral adducts at the active site [PhCH2CONHCH2M(XY)-OSer] have been assessed as sources of transition-state analogs and as inhibitors of the class C \xce\xb2-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99. It was found by experiment that the aldehyde, the silanetriol, and the \xce\xb1-keto acid (and its methyl ester) of the series were significantly poorer inhibitors than the structurally analogous boronate. This result was explored computationally. From the starting point of the crystal structure of a phosphonate adduct (Lobkovsky et al. Biochemistry 1994, 33, 6762), the various inhibitors were introduced into the active site and the complete structure relaxed by energy minimization in a force field. Tetrahedral structures derived from analogous substrates were similarly treated, and the final structures were analyzed both structurally and energetically. From the point of view of energy, it was found that the boronate (M = B, X = Y = OH), phosphonate (M = P, X = Y = O), and carbon substrate-derived analog (M = C, X = O, Y = OH) interacted comparably strongly in a noncovalent sense with the active-site residues, while the aldehyde (M = C, X = O, Y = H), silicate (M = Si, X = O, Y = OH), and \xce\xb1-keto acid derivatives (M = C, X = O, Y = COR) interacted more weakly. The order of energies of interaction between the tetrahedral ligands and the active site was shown to best correlate with the electrostatic interactions of the MXY- moiety with the two conserved lysine residues of the \xce\xb2-lactamase active site, here Lys 67 and Lys 315. There appeared to be no positive correlation between the interaction energy of X- with the oxyanion hole and the total interaction energy; the oxyanion hole therefore appears to contribute uniformly to the ligand binding but not to discrimination between ligands. There was, however, a correlation between the active site interaction energies and the interaction energy between MXY- and the H2(\xce\xb12) helix dipole. The H2 helix may therefore contribute selectively toward catalysis and inhibition. The structures were interpreted in terms of the mechanism of Oefner et al. (Oefner et al. Nature (London) 1990, 343, 284). The relationship of the calculations to the measured inhibitory properties of the parent molecules is discussed as well as projections to further inhibitor design. "
"The rational design, the synthesis via a new convergent approach, and the characterization of four generations of monodendrons based on the AB3 building block methyl 3,4,5-trishydroxybenzoate are described. The first generation monodendrons are crystalline. The second generation methyl 3,4,5-tris-3\xe2\x80\x98,4\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-[tris(n-dodecyloxy)benzyloxy]benzoate (12Gn-AG-CH3, n = 2), the corresponding benzyl alcohol (12G2-AG-CH2OH) and benzoic acid (12G2-AG), and all higher generation monodendrons with n = 3 and 4 exhibit in addition to the crystal phase an isomorphous cubic liquid-crystalline (LC) phase of Pm3\xcc\x84n space group. The cubic unit cell parameters of 12G2-AG, 12G3-AG, and 12G4-AG are 68.3, 79.2, and 84.0 \xc3\x85, respectively. Computed electron density profiles demonstrated that in the cubic phase 12, 6, and 2 monodendrons of generation 2, 3 and 4 are self-assembled in supramolecular dendrimers resembling spherical micelles when they are centered at the corners and the body-center and respectively highly rounded tetrahedra when they are at 1/4 and 3/4 distance along one of the bisectors of each face of the cubic cell. This novel thermotropic LC phase is similar to that of the lyotropic Pm3\xcc\x84n phase of biological lipids. These supramolecular dendrimers contain a poly(benzyl ether) core dispersed in an aliphatic matrix of nearly uniform density which is made up of the melted terminal long alkyl chains of the monodendrons. The size of the supramolecular dendrimer and of the entire unit cell increases with generation number as a result of a disproportionately large increase in the number of AB3 repeat units relative to the number of terminal alkyl chains in a monodendron which decreases its average cone angle. The present experiments provide the first examples of monodendrons which self-assemble into spherical supramolecular dendrimers forming a thermotropic cubic LC phase. "
"Isocyanates 7 were formed from monoprotected diamines 3 or 6, which in turn can be easily prepared from commercially available N-BOC- or N-FMOC-protected amino acid derivatives. Isocyanates 7, formed in situ, could be coupled directly to a solid support functionalized with amine groups or to amino acids anchored on resins using CH2Cl2 as solvent and an 11 h coupling time at 25 \xc2\xb0C. Such couplings afforded peptidomimetics with an N-phthaloyl group at the N-terminus. The optimal conditions identified for removal of the N-phthaloyl group were to use 60% hydrazine in DMF for 1\xe2\x88\x923 h. Several sequences of amino acids coupled to ureas (\xe2\x80\x9cpeptidic ureas\xe2\x80\x9d) and of sequential urea units (\xe2\x80\x9coligoureas\xe2\x80\x9d) were prepared via solid phase syntheses and isolated by HPLC. Partition coefficients were measured for two of these peptidomimetics, and their water solubilities were found to be similar to the corresponding peptides. A small library of 160 analogues of the YGGFL-amide sequence was prepared via Houghten\'s tea bag methodology. This library was tested for binding to the anti-\xce\xb2-endorphin monoclonal antibody. Overall, this paper describes methodology for solid phase syntheses of oligourea derivatives with side chains corresponding to some of the protein amino acids. The chemistry involved is ideal for high-throughput syntheses and screening operations. The products can be expected to have an interesting range of pharmacological properties and enhanced proteolytic stabilities relative to the corresponding peptides. "
"Direct evidence for the involvement of thiophene S-oxide as a key primary reactive intermediate in the metabolism of thiophene (1) in rats was obtained from the isolation of two diastereoisomeric thiophene S-oxide dimers, 4a and 4b, both in vitro (oxidation of thiophene with rat liver microsomes) and in vivo (isolation of 4a from rat urine). The structure of these dimers was established after an original preparation of identical samples by oxidation of thiophene with H2O2 and CF3COOH. In fact, the H2O2/CF3COOH system appeared to be the best oxidizing agent for the selective transformation of thiophene to its S-oxide. The complete determination of the structures of 4a and 4b was carried out for the first time by X-ray diffraction for the former and by a sequence of chemical reactions for the latter. The reported results indicate two fates for thiophene S-oxide in vivo: (i) its dimerization via a Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reaction and (ii) its reaction with nucleophiles such as glutathione leading eventually to mercapturates. These results together with recent literature data on thiophene derivatives suggest that thiophene S-oxides, a class of reactive intermediates whose chemistry is still not well-known, could play a central role in the metabolism and toxic effects of thiophenes in mammals. This situation would be different from that observed in the metabolism of other aromatic compounds, such as benzene or furan, in which arene oxides are predominant intermediates. "
"CF2BrCl reacts with aluminum/N-methylpyrrolidinone in the presence of chlorotrimethylsilane to give Me3SiCF2Cl in high yield. Similarly, CF2Br2 gives Me3SiCF2Br with bromotrimethylsilane. Chlorodifluoromethylation of aldehydes using Me3SiCF2Cl and a catalytic amount of TBAF in polar solvents occurs at room temperature, providing difluoromethylated alcohols in two steps. Electroreduction of Me3SiCF2Cl in the presence of chlorotrimethylsilane gives Me3SiCF2SiMe3 (anion-derived product) and Me3SiCF2CF2SiMe3 (radical-derived product). Using THF/HMPA strongly favors the former, whereas THF/TDA-1 (tris(3,6-dioxaheptyl)amine) the latter. Me3SiCF2SiMe3 difluoromethylates aldehydes acting as a difluoromethylene dianion (\xe2\x80\x9cCF22-\xe2\x80\x9d equivalent), whereas Me3SiCF2CF2SiMe3 acts at room temperature as an in situ source for the perfluorovinyl anion (due to \xce\xb2-elimination of fluorotrimethylsilane). However, at low temperature the elimination pathway is suppressed and tetrafluoroethylene dianion (\xe2\x80\x9c-CF2CF2-\xe2\x80\x9d equivalent) behavior is observed. The structure of Me3SiCF2CF2SiMe3 was analyzed by X-ray diffraction. All of the studied fluoroalkylating reagents are moisture- and air-stable and can be readily obtained from a single convenient precursor (CF2BrCl). "
"Dimesitylcarbene (2a) was shown to decay by undergoing dimerization and to have a half-life of 160 ms, some 5 orders of magnitude longer-lived than diphenylcarbene. Didurylcarbene (2b) was twice as long-lived as 2a, while decamethyldiphenylcarbene (2c) decayed mainly unimolecularly by abstracting H from the o-methyl group and became shorter-lived than 2b. 2,4,6-Tri(tert-butyl)diphenylcarbene (14) decayed unimolecularly almost exclusively by abstracting H from the o-tert-butyl group and showed the lifetime of 125 \xce\xbcs. The Arrhenius plot for H and D abstraction of 2c and 14 gave data consistent with a classical atom-transfer reaction, although the kinetic parameters are very different between the two systems. "
"The structure elucidations of new fungal products CP-225,917 and CP-263,114 are described. The structures, including relative stereochemistry, were established using a variety of analytical data and extensive NMR analysis. The compounds possess a bicyclo[4.3.1]deca-1,6-dien-10-one system in conjunction with a maleic anhydride moiety, a \xce\xb3-lactol, and two alkenyl side chains. They are related to nonadrides, and their biosynthetic origins are proposed. The producing organism also yields zaragozic acid A, and both zaragozic acids and compounds CP-225,917 and CP-263,114 appear to be derived from the condensation of oxaloacetic acid and the corresponding monocarboxylic acid.

"Optically active difluoroboron complexes of both a conventional urobilin derivative (3) and a nonracemizable urobilin analogue (4) have been synthesized for the first time, and their structures have been determined, in solution, by means of 1H{1H}NOE difference experiments. Whereas the BF2 chelate 5 occurs in a \xe2\x80\x9cstretched\xe2\x80\x9d 9Z,4(5)-ac, 5(6)-sc,10(11)sp,14(15)-sc,15(16)-ac conformation in both dimethylformamide and methylene chloride solutions, the preferred conformation (6 or 7) of the difluoroboron complex of 4 is dependent on the solvent, thus giving rise to opposite CD curves in the aforementioned solvents. As revealed by X-ray diffraction analysis, however, only conformer 6 is present in the solid state, in which extended intermolecular hydrogen bonding involving the lactam groups takes place, independently of the solvent used for crystallization. Conformer 7, on the contrary, is stabilized, in solution, by intramolecular NH\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7F bonds, as evidenced by measurements of \xe2\x80\x9cthrough-space\xe2\x80\x9d 1H\xe2\x88\x9219F spin\xe2\x88\x92spin coupling.

"Fourteen novel ferrocene derivatives have been designed to serve as receptors for low molecular weight diamines. The compounds that have been prepared and fully characterized possess two ferrocenedicarboxylic acid residues bridged by amide formation in their respective 1\xe2\x80\x98-positions by 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-benzidinyl (15), 3,3\xe2\x80\x98-dimethoxy-4,4\xe2\x80\x98-benzidinyl (16), 2,7-fluorenyl (17), 3-methoxy-2,7-fluorenyl (18), 4-N-piperazinoanilinyl (19), N,N\xe2\x80\x98-4,4\xe2\x80\x98-bipiperdinyl (20), and 4,13-diaza-18-crown-6 (21). In two cases, ferrocenecarboxylic acid was bridged by spacers attached using 1-methylene groups. The bridges in these cases were 4,13-diaza-18-crown-6 (22) and 1,5-diaminoanthraquinone (24). In a single case, ferrocenecarboxylic acid was bridged by 1,5-dicarbonylnaphthalene (25). In one additional case, the bridge was created by formation of an imine followed by hydrogenation, but both compounds (26, 27) proved to be relatively unstable. Attempts to increase solubility afforded the N-ethylated derivative 28 of 15 and the derivative 29 of 27 having carboxamides in the 1\xe2\x80\x98-positions. A solid state structure of the diethyl ester of 20 confirms the design criteria. Complexation constants were determined in THF-d8 or CDCl3 for combinations of receptors 18, 19, and 20 with 4-aminopyridine, N,N,N\xe2\x80\x98,N\xe2\x80\x98-tetramethylethylenediamine, N,N,N\xe2\x80\x98,N\xe2\x80\x98-tetramethylpropylenediamine, DABCO, 3-propyladenine, and benzimidazole and were in the range 102\xe2\x88\x92104. The anticipated complexation mechanism for 20 with N,N,N\xe2\x80\x98,N\xe2\x80\x98-tetramethylpropylenediamine was confirmed by observation of an NOE between host and guest. "
"Benzyl glutamate NCA was graft-polymerized onto a porous poly(tetrafluoroethylene) membrane in order to study the effects of pH and ionic strength on permeation rate. The membrane was first glow-discharged in the presence of ammonia in order to produce amino groups on the surface. Following graft polymerization the graft chains were hydrolyzed to yield poly(glutamic acid). The rate of water permeation through this poly(glutamic acid)-grafted polymer membrane was pH-dependent and found to be slow under high-pH conditions and fast under low-pH conditions. Under high-pH conditions, randomly coiled graft chains extend to close the pores. The chains form a helix structure and open the pores under low-pH conditions. The magnitude of the permeation rate was dependent upon the length and density of graft chains. Ionic strength also affected the permeation rate. "
"X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies have been systematically carried out for the new high-Tc superconducting intercalation compounds, (HgX2)0.5Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy (X = Br and I), with a hybridized crystal lattice consisting of superconducting layer and insulating one. From the Hg LIII-edge EXAFS analysis, it is found for the first time that the intercalated mercuric halide is stabilized as a linear molecule with the bond distance (Hg\xe2\x88\x92X) of 2.46 \xc3\x85 for the HgBr2 intercalate and 2.65 \xc3\x85 for the HgI2 one, respectively. These are cross-confirmed not only by micro-Raman studies but also by one-dimensional electron density mapping based on (00l) X-ray reflections, which is well consistent with the EXAFS fitting results. The present I LI- and Br K-edge XANES results indicate a partial electron transfer from the host lattice of Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy to the intercalant HgX2 layer with the partial oxidations of Bi2O2 and CuO2 layers. And the latter was also observed clearly from the Bi LIII-edge XANES and Cu K-edge EXAFS analyses, which are in good agreement with the I LI- and Br K-edge XANES results. It is, therefore, concluded that the charge transfer between host and guest is mainly responsible for the Tc evolution upon intercalation, and the Tc of this compound is surely related to the variation of hole concentration rather than electronic coupling along the c-axis.

"A series of compounds of formula 1,2-M2(\xcf\x83-Th)2(NMe2)4, 1, has been prepared, where M = Mo and/or W and Th = 2-thienyl[2-Th], 3-thienyl[3-Th], 5-methyl-2-thienyl[2,5-MeTh], and 2-benzothienyl[2-BTh]. In hydrocarbon solvents these compounds exist as a mixture of anti and gauche rotamers having a central CN2M\xe2\x8b\xaeMN2C core. Addition of tBuOH or CF3Me2COH to hydrocarbon solutions of 1, where M = W, lead to ring-opened products, 2, when the thienyl ligand is attached via the 2-carbon position. No ring-opening occurs for 3-thienyl derivatives. W2(OR)5(\xce\xbc-CCH2CHCHS)(\xcf\x83-2-Th), 2, where one of the 2-thienyl rings has been opened, has been fully characterized and shown to be derived from a ring-opened \xce\xbc-vinylidene intermediate W2(OtBu)4(\xce\xbc-CCHCHCHS)(\xcf\x83-2-Th). Rather interestingly, the compound W2(\xcf\x83-2-Th)(NMe2)5 reacts with tBuOH to give only W2(2-Th)(OtBu)5 and HNMe2. Reactions between 1 and the less sterically demanding alcohols iPrOH and tBuCH2OH lead to W2(OR)6 compounds with liberation of HNMe2 and the sulfur containing hydrocarbon. Compound 1 (M = W, 2-Th) reacts with CO2 to give W2(NMe2)2(O2CNMe2)2(\xcf\x83-2-Th)2, 3, while with pivalic anhydride W2(O2CtBu)4 is formed via reductive elimination of the C\xe2\x88\x92C coupled product 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bithiophene and tBuCONMe2 (4 equiv). 1 (M = W, 2-Th) and CO yield a product formulated as W2(NMe2)4(\xce\xbc-CCHCHCHS)(\xcf\x83-2-Th)(CO)3 wherein one ring has opened to form a \xce\xbc-vinylidene thiolate ligand. Attempts to prepare 1,2-W2L2(NMe2)4 compounds are described where L = an \xce\xb71-nitrogen containing heterocycle but only for L = 2-methylindolyl was a compound successfully characterized. Reactions of these compounds with tBuOH gave W2(OtBu)6 and LH (2 equiv). The compound W2(\xcf\x83-2-Fu)2(NMe2)4 was prepared and characterized (2-Fu = 2-furyl) and shown to undergo ring-opening in its reaction with tBuOH to give W2(OtBu)5(\xce\xbc-CCH2CHCHO)(\xcf\x83-2-Fu), 4, in an analogous manner to the 2-Th complex. The complexes 1 (M = W, 2-Th), 2, 3, and 4 have been characterized by single crystal X-ray studies. The results described herein are compared to other ring-opening reactions of S, N, and O organic heterocyclic compounds as models for the activation of S, N, and O containing fossil fuels in hydrodesulfurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) processes. The cleavage of the C\xe2\x88\x92X bonds at the (M\xe2\x8b\xaeM)6+ centers (M = Mo, W and X = S, N and O) is also compared with earlier cleavage reactions involving C\xe2\x8b\xaeO, RC\xe2\x8b\xaeN, R2CO, and Ar2CS compounds.

"Reaction of CH3Co(dmgBF2)2L (dmgBF2 = (difluoroboryl)dimethylglyoximato); L = py, PEt3) with 2 equiv of [Ni(tmc)]OTf (tmc = 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane; OTf- = CF3SO3-) gave Co(dmgBF2)2py-, [Ni(tmc)]OTf2, and [Ni(tmc)CH3]OTf in 80% yield. The overall transformation provides the first model for the transfer of a CH3 group from methylcobalamin to the Ni-containing enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase during acetyl coenzyme A synthesis. RRSS\xe2\x88\x92[Ni(tmc)CH3](BAr\xe2\x80\x984) (BAr\xe2\x80\x984- = B(3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)4-) has been characterized by X-ray diffraction. The products and 1CH3Co(dmgBF2)2L:2[Ni(tmc)]OTf stoichiometry of the reaction are consistent with a three-step mechanism initiated by electron transfer from [Ni(tmc)]OTf to CH3Co(dmgBF2)2L. The second step is rapid CH3\xe2\x88\x92Co- bond homolysis yielding Co(dmgBF2)2L- and CH3\xe2\x80\xa2; then the CH3 radical is captured by the second equivalent of [Ni(tmc)]OTf, yielding [Ni(tmc)CH3]OTf. Radical clock experiments have corroborated the production of free radicals. Reaction of (5-hexenyl)Co(dmgBF2)2L with [Ni(tmc)]OTf, followed by hydrolysis of the organonickel products, gave methylcyclopentane, consistent with the formation and cyclization of the 1-hexenyl radical. The second-order rate constants measured by stopped-flow experiments parallel the relative radical stabilities:\xe2\x80\x89 R = CH3 (2.43 \xc3\x97 103 M-1 s-1) < C2H5 (7.88 \xc3\x97 103 M-1 s-1) < CH(CH3)2 (19.2 \xc3\x97 103 M-1 s-1), L = py (2.43 \xc3\x97 103 M-1 s-1) < PEt3 (5.01 \xc3\x97 103 M-1 s-1). During the course of these studies the following molecules were also characterized by X-ray diffraction, CH3Co(dmgBF2)2L, L = PEt3, py, H2O. "
"The sequential ligand 5-H3, which contains one catechol and one aminophenol unit, was prepared in a four-step sequence. The two electronically different binding sites of 5 are able to control the metal-directed self-assembly of binuclear coordination compounds with different ligand orientations. In coordination studies with titanium(IV) or gallium(III) ions, this ligand 5 was used to obtain anionic homobinuclear complexes [(5)3Ti2]- and [(5)3Ga2]3- with two ligands orientated in one and the third in the opposite direction (type II structure). On the other hand, if the ligand 5 reacts with a 1:1 mixture of titanium(IV) and gallium(III) ions exclusively, the heterobimetallic complex [(5)3GaTi]2- is formed in a cooperative process. In this coordination compound the three ligands are orientated in one direction (type I structure). For K2[(5)3GaTi]\xc2\xb76DMF\xc2\xb7ether, space group P21/c, a = 12.868(3) \xc3\x85, b = 19.902(2) \xc3\x85, c = 27.063(2) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 102.22(1)\xc2\xb0, V = 6774(2) \xc3\x853, Z = 4, and R = 0.071. The structural analysis shows that titanium(IV) binds to the catecholate moieties while gallium(III) prefers the aminophenolate binding site of the ligand 5. Internal hydrogen bonding enhances the stability of the \xce\x9b\xce\x94 configurated binuclear complex. "
"The catalytic reduction of cis-dimethyldiazene by the (Et4N)2[(Cl4-cat)(CH3CN)MoFe3S4Cl3] cluster (Cl4-cat = tetrachlorocatecholate) is reported. Unlike the reduction of cis-dimethyldiazene by the Fe/Mo/S center of nitrogenase, which yields methylamine, ammonia, and methane (the latter from the reduction of the C\xe2\x88\x92N bond), the reduction of cis-dimethyldiazene by the synthetic cluster yields exclusively methylamine. In separate experiments, it was shown that the C\xe2\x88\x92N bond of methylamine is not reduced by the [MoFe3S4]3+ core, perhaps accounting for the differences observed between the biological and abiological systems. 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine, a possible partially reduced intermediate in the reduction of cis-dimethyldiazene, was also shown to be reduced to methylamine. Interaction of methylamine with the Mo atom of the cubane was confirmed through the synthesis and structural characterization of (Et4N)2[(Cl4-cat)(CH3NH2)MoFe3S4Cl3]. Phosphine inhibition studies strongly suggest that the Mo atom of the [MoFe3S4]3+ core, which has a Mo coordination environment very similar to that in nitrogenase, is responsible for the binding and activation of cis-dimethyldiazene. The reduction of a NN bond exclusively at the heterometal site of a nitrogenase-relevant synthetic compound may have implications regarding the function of the nitrogenase Fe/Mo/S center, particularly in the latter stages of dinitrogen reduction.

"Kinetics data were collected for the palladium-catalyzed reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide (N2O) with cuprous chloride reductant in 2 M hydrochloric acid (2NO + 2CuCl + 2HCl \xe2\x86\x92 N2O + 2CuCl2 + H2O). The rate-determining step was first order in the palladium concentration and NO partial pressure. The cuprous chloride dependence was first order below 0.1 M; at higher concentrations saturation kinetics were observed. The rate of reaction was independent of H+ and Cl- concentrations. Kinetics results were consistent with the initial, reversible attack (k1/k-1) of free NO on the bound nitrosyl of [PdCl3NO]2- yielding [PdCl3(N2O2)]2-, which is then reduced by Cu(I) (k2) to generate products and recycle the palladium. A k1 value of (6.0 \xc2\xb1 0.4) \xc3\x97 10-6 (PNO)-1 s-1 at 20 \xc2\xb0C was calculated, with a k-1/k2 ratio of 0.116 \xc2\xb1 0.004 \xce\x9c. Rate measurements show that NO reduction by Cu(I) is the rate-limiting step in the Wacker-style catalysis of the CO + 2NO \xe2\x86\x92 CO2 + N2O reaction. The current mechanism resembles the nitric oxide reductase activities of cytochrome c oxidases, which proceed by Cu(I) reduction of a heme bound nitrosyl, and cytochrome P450nor. "
"A \xce\xb2-cyclodextrin dimer with a linking bipyridyl group is synthesized as a catalyst precursor, a holoenzyme mimic. It binds both ends of potential substrates into the two different cyclodextrin cavities, holding the substrate ester carbonyl group directly above a metal ion bound to the bipyridyl unit. The result is very effective ester hydrolysis with good turnover catalysis. For example, a Cu(II) complex accelerates the rate of hydrolysis of several nitrophenyl esters by a factor of 104\xe2\x88\x92105, with at least 50 turnovers and no sign of product inhibition. In the best case, with an added nucleophile that also binds to the metal ion, a rate acceleration of 1.45 \xc3\x97 107 over the background reaction rate was observed. Hydrolysis by a catalyst with only one cyclodextrin binding group is significantly slower than in the bidentate binding cases. As expected, the binding of a transition state analogue to these catalysts is stronger with the metal ion present than without. This and kinetic evidence point to a mechanism in which the metal ion plays a bifunctional acid\xe2\x88\x92base role, enforced by the binding geometry that holds the substrate functionality right on top of the catalytic metal ion.

"The primary reaction products of laser-ablated uranium atoms with dihydrogen (UH, UH2, UH3, UH4, U2H2, and U2H4) have been isolated for the first time in solid argon and identified by the effects of isotopic substitution on their infrared spectra. Calculations, using DFT methods, have been performed to provide theoretical support for the spectral assignments. The molecules U(\xce\xbc-H2)U and U2H4 represent the first examples of an actinide-actinide bond. "
"Singly- and multiply-protonated ubiquitin molecules are found to react with iodide anions, and certain other anions, by attachment of the anion, in competition with proton transfer to the anion. The resulting adduct ions are relatively weakly bound and dissociate upon collisional activation by loss of the neutral acid derived from the anion. Adduct ions that behave similarly can also be formed via ion/molecule reactions involving the neutral acid. The ion/molecule reaction phenomenology, however, stands in contrast with that expected based on the reaction site(s) being charged. Reaction rates increase inversely with charge state and the total number of neutral molecules that add to the protein cations increases inversely with cation charge. These observations are inconsistent with the formation of proton-bound clusters but are fully consistent with the formation of ion pairs or dipole/dipole bonding involving the neutral acid and neutral basic sites in the protein. The ion/ion reactions can be interpreted on the basis of conjugate acid/base chemistry in which the anion, which is a strong gaseous base, reacts with a protonated site, which is a strong gaseous acid. Adduct ions can also be formed via ion/molecule reaction which, on the basis of microscopic reversibility, implies that the neutral acid interacts with neutral basic sites on the protein cation. These results suggest that acid adduction to gaseous protein cations can be complementary in nature to chemical reactions, such as proton transfer and hydrogen/deuterium exchange, that are strongly mediated by the charge site(s). "
"Transmission infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption have been used to investigate the chemistry of CH3I adsorbed on silica-supported copper nanoparticles. The following three factors affect the chemistry of CH3I on Cu/SiO2:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) the oxidation state of the copper, (ii) the hydroxyl group coverage on the silica support, and (iii) the surface roughness of the copper particles. These three factors can be controlled by sample preparation. On reduced-Cu/SiO2 samples, C\xe2\x88\x92I bond dissociation in adsorbed methyl iodide results in the formation of adsorbed methyl groups on the copper surface. The frequency of the symmetric stretch of adsorbed methyl groups is at 2913 cm-1 for copper nanoparticles with atomically smooth surface morphology and at 2924 cm-1 for copper nanoparticles with atomically rough surface morphology. In addition to methyl groups adsorbed on the copper nanoparticles, for reduced Cu/SiO2 samples with Si\xe2\x88\x92OH groups present in close proximity to the copper particles, methyl groups can spill over on to the silica support and react with OH groups to form SiOCH3. The silica hydroxyl coverage also plays a role in methyl reactions on the copper particles as hydroxyl groups provide a source of hydrogen atoms. Methane and ethane are the predominant reaction products for reduced Cu/SiO2 samples with high hydroxyl group coverage whereas methane, ethane, and ethylene form on samples with low silica hydroxyl group coverage. The copper particle morphology may also play a role in the chemistry of adsorbed methyl groups as there is some evidence for slower methyl reaction kinetics on the copper nanoparticles with rough surface morphology. C\xe2\x88\x92I bond dissociation in adsorbed methyl iodide occurs on oxidized-copper nanoparticles as well. The infrared spectrum taken after adsorption of CH3I on oxidized-Cu/SiO2 is consistent with the presence of adsorbed methoxy groups and bidentate formate on the oxidized-copper particles. The chemistry of methyl groups on oxidized-copper particles is similar to that of methanol on oxidized-copper particles. Finally, the use and complexities of characterizing these samples and copper catalysts in general with CO adsorption in conjunction with infrared spectroscopy are discussed. "
"The structural characteristics and reactivity of the gas-phase FSi(OCH3)2(OCH2)- ion were investigated by a combination of ab initio calculations and FT-ICR techniques. The theoretical calculations for different possible structures reveal that carbanion and alkoxide ion type structures lead to ring closure upon geometry optimization to yield two different cyclic fluoride\xe2\x88\x92siloxirane structures. The FSi(OCH3)2(cyc-OCH2)- ions containing the elusive siloxirane ring are estimated to be extremely stable with respect to F- (69 kcal mol-1) dissociation in agreement with earlier calculations on simpler systems. Experimentally, this ion is formed as a minor product (7%) in the gas-phase ion/molecule reaction of F- with Si(OMe)4 and is observed to undergo readily fluoride transfer to the parent neutral. This strongly suggests an ion with a structure corresponding to a fluoride adduct of a siloxirane species. Reaction of FSi(OCH3)2(OCH2)- with BF3, hexafluorobenzene, and gas-phase acids more acidic than ethanol further suggests that this ion is capable of reacting as an alkoxide type nucleophile or base. This latter behavior has been associated with the possibility of ring opening of the siloxirane in the collision complex that mediates this ion/molecule reaction. "

Simple electronic structural considerations are proposed in order to provide a preliminary interpretation of these remarkable results. "
"We have measured polarized Raman spectra of the model peptides glycylglycine and N-acetylglycine in aqueous solution with different excitation wavelengths. The spectra in the region between 1500 and 1800 cm-1 were consistently analyzed by using the same band shapes, halfwidths, and frequencies to fit the profiles of corresponding Raman bands. The quality and the statistical significance of the fits were judged by their residuals and reduced \xcf\x872 numbers. This strategy enables us to obtain reliable spectral parameters of even strongly overlapping bands. Our experimental results show that the amide I bands of glycylglycine and N-acetylglycine in H2O are composed of two subbands, whereas the corresponding amide I\xe2\x80\x98 band of glycylglycine in D2O can be fitted by one single band. Moreover, we found that the amide I band region in the Raman spectra of glycylglycine in different H2O/D2O mixtures (i.e., 25%/75%, 50%/50%, and 75%/25%) significantly deviate from the weighted superposition of the corresponding spectra of glycylglycine in pure H2O and D2O. These results are rationalized by invoking vibrational coupling between the amide I mode and the bending modes of the surrounding water molecules which provide a continuum of vibrational states. This coupling is absent in D2O because deuteration causes a downshift of the water\'s bending mode. In H2O/D2O mixtures the undeuterated species exhibits a reduced splitting of its amide I band due to the lower density of H2O molecules. Hence our results show that peptides and their aqueous environment form a dynamic entity. For glycylglycine the analysis of amide II also reveals a splitting into two subbands which most likely results from two different conformers with respect to the orientation of the carboxyl group. "

In the free ligand, the conformation of glycosidic linkage I is disordered with {\xce\xa6I, \xce\xa8I} sampling values close to {\xe2\x88\x9260\xc2\xb0, 0\xc2\xb0}, {\xe2\x88\x92100\xc2\xb0, \xe2\x88\x9250\xc2\xb0}, and {180\xc2\xb0, 0\xc2\xb0}. The trisaccharide portion is rigid and characterized by {\xce\xa6II, \xce\xa8II; \xce\xa6III, \xce\xa8III} = {46\xc2\xb0, 18\xc2\xb0; 48\xc2\xb0, 24\xc2\xb0}.

The bound conformations of the ligand were calculated from the full relaxation matrix analysis of transferred-NOE spectra for E- and P-selectin or by using a two-spin approximation for the L-selectin complex. Both E- and P-selectin recognize the {\xe2\x88\x9260\xc2\xb0, 0\xc2\xb0} conformation of sLex while the {\xe2\x88\x92100\xc2\xb0, \xe2\x88\x9250\xc2\xb0} conformer is probably recognized by L-selectin. The conformation of the branched trisaccharide portion in the bound state remains close to the conformation of the free ligand. In the E-, P-, and L-selectin complexes the GalH4 proton is in the vicinity of protein aromatic protons, most likely Tyr94 and/or Tyr48. "
"2\xe2\x80\x98-Deoxyribonucleosides (2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyadenosine (1), 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxycytidine (2), thymidine (3)) singly enriched with 13C at C2\xe2\x80\x98 have been prepared and used to obtain one-, two-, and three-bond 13C\xe2\x88\x921H and 13C\xe2\x88\x9213C spin-coupling constants involving C2\xe2\x80\x98. Coupling data are interpreted with assistance from complementary 3JHH data (PSEUROT analysis), furanose structural parameters obtained from molecular orbital calculations, structure-coupling correlations found for JCH and JCC in carbohydrates, and calculated J values. Spin couplings in 1\xe2\x88\x923 involving C1\xe2\x80\x98 and C2\xe2\x80\x98 are also compared to corresponding values in ribonucleosides in order to assess the effects of nucleoside structure and conformation on J values within the furanose ring. 1JC2\xe2\x80\x98,H2\xe2\x80\x98R and 1JC2\xe2\x80\x98,H2\xe2\x80\x98S in 1\xe2\x88\x923 and 1JC2\xe2\x80\x98,H2\xe2\x80\x98 in ribonucleosides depend on C\xe2\x88\x92H bond orientation; 1JC1\xe2\x80\x98,H1\xe2\x80\x98 in 1\xe2\x88\x923 and in ribonucleosides exhibits a similar dependence. The latter couplings appear to be essentially unaffected by N-glycoside torsion. 1JCC values depend on the number and distribution of electronegative substituents on the C\xe2\x88\x92C fragment. A modified projection curve is proposed to aid in the interpretation of 2JC2\xe2\x80\x98,H1\xe2\x80\x98 values; the presence of N substitution at C1\xe2\x80\x98 causes a shift to more negative couplings relative to the O-substituted analog. In contrast, 2JC1\xe2\x80\x98,H2\xe2\x80\x98 is essentially unaffected by the same change in the electronegative substituent at C1\xe2\x80\x98. 2JCC values within the furanose ring are determined by two coupling pathways; in one case (i.e., 2JC1\xe2\x80\x98,C3\xe2\x80\x98), the observed coupling is shown to be the algebraic sum of the two couplings arising from each pathway. 3JCH and 3JCC values depend in general on appropriate molecular dihedral angles as expected (Karplus relationships); however, 3JC2\xe2\x80\x98,H4\xe2\x80\x98 values exhibit unexpected behavior, thus suggesting potential limitations in its use as a structural probe.

"[1.1]Ferrocenophanyllithium (1) is shown by dynamic NMR (DNMR) and isotopic perturbation to undergo a rapid intramolecular 1,12-proton transfer coupled with 1,12-lithium ion transfer. The first [C\xe2\x88\x92H\xe2\x88\x92C]- hydrogen bond previously reported to be present in 1 is shown by X-ray crystallography to be absent in the solid state. The 13C NMR spectrum of the bridge-labeled compound [1,12-13C2][1.1]ferrocenophanyl[1-6Li]lithium (6) in 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) displays a 1:1:1 triplet (1J(13C,6Li) = 4.0 Hz) showing that 6Li is bonded to C-1 and that 1 is monomeric. Transient nuclear Overhauser effects (tNOE\'s) measured in DEE-d10 in bridged monodeuterated 1 show that the bridges in 1 are syn and not anti to each other and that lithium is exo-coordinated to the anionic bridge carbon. The 1J(13C,1H) coupling constants show that the hybridization of the carbanionic carbon is intermediate between sp2 and sp3. Thus the solution and solid state structures of 1 are similar. UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectroscopy shows that 1 exists mainly as contact ion pairs (CIPs) in the temperature range \xe2\x88\x92100 to +25 \xc2\xb0C in THF, DMTHF, and diethyl ether (DEE). In dimethoxyethane (DME), 1 is mainly CIPs above +25 \xc2\xb0C but is mainly separated ion pairs (SIPs) below \xe2\x88\x9230 \xc2\xb0C. "
"Insight into the detailed mechanism of carbon lithiation by an organolithium reagent and of carbon sodiation by an organosodium reagent has been obtained using [1.1]ferrocenophanyllithium (1) and [1.1]ferrocenophanylsodium (3), respectively. In tetrahydrofuran (THF) 1 and 3 undergo rapid 1,12-proton transfer reactions which are coupled with 1,12-lithium ion and 1,12-sodium ion transfers, respectively. It is concluded that the degenerate rearrangement of 1 does not make use of a pseudorotation mechanism, but occurs by direct conversion of a syn-conformer to another syn-conformer. Activation parameters (\xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 19 kJ mol-1 and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9293 J K-1 mol-1) for the degenerate reaction of 1 in THF have been measured by dynamic NMR spectroscopy. The primary isotope effect (kH/kD) of the 1,12-hydron transfer is 7.4 \xc2\xb1 1.5 at 320 K. The degenerate rearrangement of 1 shows strong solvent dependence, e.g. the reaction is 4 \xc3\x97 103 times faster in THF than in dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF). Thus, the rearrangement may be catalyzed by THF in DMTHF. The catalysis is first order in THF at low concentrations of THF. The results show that in the rate-limiting activated complex the lithium ion is coordinating one solvent molecule more than in the initial state. It is paired with a carbanion in which the proton is symmetrically located between the bridge carbons. Compound 3 shows a behavior similar to that of 1, but it is more fluxtional. It also shows a solvent catalysis that is weaker than for 1. It is concluded that 3 also exchanges using an activated complex that contains one solvent molecule more than the initial complex. "
"Effects of a highly conserved hydrogen bond between the distal histidine (His) and a nearby asparagine residue (Asn) of peroxidases upon the active site structures were investigated using resonance Raman (RR) and EPR spectroscopy. Although there is no crystallographic data for horseradish peroxidase (HRP), Asn70 is deduced to be the hydrogen bond acceptor for HRP. Accordingly, site-directed mutagenesis of Asn70 to Val (N70V) and to Asp (N70D) was carried out with HRP, and their RR spectra were compared with those of native and wild type (WT) enzymes in the resting, reduced, CN-bound ferric and compound II states. In the resting state, the six-coordinate high-spin structure is the main component for N70V and N70D mutants, while the five-coordinate high-spin structure is dominant for the native and WT HRPs. This was confirmed with EPR spectra. The FeIII\xe2\x88\x92CN stretching (\xce\xbdFe-CN) and bending RR bands of the linear and bent forms were identified using 12C15N and 13C14N isotopes. The \xce\xbdFe-CN frequency of the linear form is lower for the mutants than for native enzyme, and the spectral patterns of the mutants at pH 7.0 resemble that of the basic form of native HRP. The Fe\xe2\x88\x92histidine stretching bands of reduced HRPs exhibit pH dependent frequency shifts, and the midpoint pH values were 7.2, 5.9, and 5.5 for native, N70V, and N70D, respectively. This change is ascribed to the acid\xe2\x88\x92base transition of the distal His. While the FeIVO stretching (\xce\xbdFeO) frequency of compound II at pD 7.0 is lower than that at pD 10.0 for native enzyme, the \xce\xbdFeO band of the mutants show no pH dependent frequency shifts between pD 7.0 and pD 10.0. However, the H2O/D2O frequency change of \xce\xbdFeO and the oxygen atom exchange with bulk water suggested the presence of the hydrogen bond between the oxygen ligand of the ferryloxo heme and distal His for these mutants at pD 10.0. On the basis of these observations, it is proposed that the hydrogen bond between the N\xce\xb4-proton of distal His and Asn70 regulates the pKa of the N\xce\xb5-proton (and thus the reactivity of compound II at the distal side) and also affects the Fe\xe2\x88\x92His bond at the proximal side via tertiary structure changes.

A combined modeling and experimental strategy has been applied to the problem of stabilisation of a metastable conformational polymorph. For the first time additives have been successfully selected which by virtue of their conformation are able to selectively inhibit the appearance of the stable \xce\xb2 polymorph of l-glutamic acid and hence stabilize the metastable \xce\xb1 structure. 
"Spin\xe2\x88\x92orbit coupling (SOC) calculations are performed along the reaction pathway of the oxidation process, FeO+ + H2 \xe2\x86\x92 Fe+ + H2O (eq 1). Selection rules are derived for SOC between different spin situations, and are applied to understand the computed SOC patterns along the oxidation pathway, and their relationship to the electronic structure of the various species. The process involves two spin inversion (SI) junctions between sextet and quartet states:\xe2\x80\x89 near the FeO+/H2 cluster at the entrance channel, and near the Fe+/H2O cluster at the exit channel. The sextet\xe2\x88\x92quartet SOC is significant at the reactant extreme (for FeO+), but decreases at the FeO+/H2 cluster and continues to decrease until it becomes vanishingly small between the 6D\xe2\x88\x924F states of Fe+ at the product extreme. The results show that while the quartet surface provides a low-energy path, the SI junctions reduce the probability of the oxidation process significantly. In agreement with the deductions of Armentrout et al.,2c the poor bond activation capability of the 6D ground state of Fe+ in the reverse reaction is accounted for by the inefficient 6D\xe2\x88\x924F state mixing due to the expected poor SOC between the respective 4s13d6 and 3d7 configurations. On the other hand, the 4F excited state of Fe+ can activate H2O more efficiently since it can lead to the insertion intermediate 4(HFeOH+) in a spin-conserving manner. Other findings of Schwarz et al.1,2a and Armentrout et al.2c,d are discussed in the light of the SOC patterns. The importance of the SOC at the exit channel is highlighted by comparing the product distribution of the reaction (eq 1) with analogous reactions of MO+ species:\xe2\x80\x89 when the ground state M+ has a 4s13dn-1 (Fe+, Mn+) electronic structure as opposed to those cases where the ground state electronic structure is 3dn (Co+, Ni+) and where no spin inversion is required. Predictions based on the understanding of the SOC patterns are made and compared with appropriate experimental data. "
"The C-3 deoxygenation of CDP-6-deoxy-l-threo-d-glycero-4-hexulose is the key step in the biosynthesis of ascarylose which is a 3,6-dideoxy sugar found in the lipopolysaccharide of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. This transformation, achieved by the catalysis of CDP-6-deoxy-l-threo-d-glycero-4-hexulose-3-dehydrase (E1) and CDP-6-deoxy-l-threo-d-glycero-4-hexulose-3-dehydrase reductase (E3), is initiated by a reversible dehydration followed by a stepwise electron transfer from NADH to reduce the resulting glucoseen\xe2\x88\x92PMP adduct. An organic radical intermediate has been detected by EPR during E1\xe2\x88\x92E3 catalysis, and its characteristics are consistent with a phenoxyl radical. Its formation has been hypothesized to involve a tautomerization of the glucoseen\xe2\x88\x92PMP intermediate to a PMP\xe2\x88\x92quinone methide species, which then serves as the electron acceptor during the reduction. In order to gain further experimental evidence supporting this proposed mechanism, the title compound (F-PMP) was synthesized and tested for its competence as a cofactor for the E1\xe2\x88\x92E3 reaction. Upon incubation with F-PMP, no C-3 deoxysugar product could be detected in the mixture. This result initially appeared to support the prediction that the 3-F substituent would prevent the tautomerization and thus inhibit the subsequent reduction. However, further analysis showed that the catalysis was actually arrested at the dehydration step since no 18O was incorporated at C-3 of the recovered substrate when the reaction was conducted in [18O]H2O, and no tritium was released when [4-3H]F-PMP replaced PMP in the incubation. Interestingly, the pKa of the ring nitrogen (N-1) of F-PMP was found to be 2.91, a value drastically altered from the 8.74 of PMP itself. Since the catalytic role of B6 coenzymes is to act as an electron sink, storing the electrons that are later used for the cleavage and/or formation of covalent bonds, protonation at N-1 is clearly essential, as it allows the formation of a salt bridge/hydrogen bond with an active site aspartate residue and also enhances the electron-withdrawing capability of the pyridine ring. Because F-PMP is not expected to exist in the pyridinium form at neutral pH, its ability to promote 4\xe2\x80\x98-H abstraction is hampered since the resulting anion cannot be delocalized by the cofactor. Although incubation of E1\xe2\x88\x92E3 with this new coenzyme B6 analog fails to provide additional support for the mechanism of this unique deoxygenation process, the results reported herein, along with those deduced from studies of other 3-substituted PLP derivatives, illustrate the importance of having an intact 3-OH group of the coenzyme in PLP/PMP dependent catalysis.

"The tritiated chiral alkanes (S)-[1-2H1,1-3H]ethane, (R)-[1-2H1,1-3H]ethane, (S)-[1-2H1,1-3H]butane, (R)-[1-2H1,1-3H]butane, (S)-[2-3H]butane, (R)-[2-3H]butane, and racemic [2-3H]butane were oxidized by soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), and the absolute stereochemistry of the resulting product alcohols was determined in order to probe the mechanism of substrate hydroxylation. When purified hydroxylase, coupling protein, and reductase components were used, the product alcohol displayed 72% retention of stereochemistry at the labeled carbon for the ethane substrates and 77% retention for the butanes labeled at the primary carbon. A putative alkyl radical which would yield these product distributions would have a lifetime of 100 fs, a value too short to correspond to a discrete intermediate. Intramolecular kH/kD ratios of 3.4 and 2.2 were determined for ethane and butane, respectively. When the hydroxylations were performed with purified hydroxylase but only a partially purified cellular extract for the coupling and reductase proteins, different product distributions were observed. These apparently anomalous results could be explained by invoking exchange of hydrogen atoms at the \xce\xb1 carbon of the product alcohols. The characteristics of this exchange reaction are discussed. Hydroxylation of [2-3H]butanes by the latter system yielded \xe2\x88\xbc90% retention of stereochemistry at the labeled carbon. The implication of these results for the catalytic mechanism of sMMO is discussed. Together with the mechanistic information available from a range of substrate probes, the results are best accounted for by a nonsynchronous concerted process involving attack on the C\xe2\x88\x92H bond by one or more of several pathways discussed in the text.

"5,6-Dihydrothymid-5-yl (4) is generated via Norrish type I cleavage of isopropyl ketone 7. Ketone 7 was site specifically incorporated into chemically synthesized polythymidylates and an oligonucleotide containing all four native deoxyribonucleotides. No damage is induced in oligonucleotides containing 7 upon photolysis under anaerobic conditions. In the presence of O2, strand breaks and alkaline labile lesions are formed at the original site of 7, and at nucleotides adjacent to the 5\xe2\x80\x98-phosphate of 7. Kinetic isotope effect experiments reveal that direct strand scission at the thymidine adjacent to the 5\xe2\x80\x98-phosphate of 4 arises from C1\xe2\x80\x98 hydrogen atom abstraction. The observed KIE (\xe2\x88\xbc3.9) is attributed to hydrogen atom abstraction from C1\xe2\x80\x98 by the peroxyl radical 35 derived from 4. Enzymatic end group analysis and measurement of free base release are consistent with a process involving C1\xe2\x80\x98 hydrogen atom abstraction. Cleavage experiments carried out in the presence of t-BuOH (1.05 M) and NaN3 (10 mM) indicate that damage does not result from hydroxyl radical, but that 1O2 is responsible for a significant amount of the observed strand damage.

"Electronic effects in osmylation reactions accelerated by pyridine and quinuclidine derivatives were investigated by varying the substituents on the amine ligand as well as on the alkene substrate. Ligand substituent effects were gauged by determination of the equilibrium constants for coordination of the amines to OsO4, evaluation of structural properties and reduction potentials of the amine\xe2\x88\x92OsO4 complexes, and analysis of the kinetics of osmylations in the presence of the amines. Substrate substituent effects were gauged by kinetic Hammett studies using several different amine/alkene combinations. Nonlinear Hammett relationships resulting from alkene substituent effects were observed, and the deviation from a linear free energy relationship was found to depend on the structure, binding capacity, and concentration of the amine. The results were evaluated in terms of the contending \xe2\x80\x9c[3 + 2]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[2 + 2]\xe2\x80\x9d mechanisms currently under consideration.

"Ruby red polycrystalline samples of 1-(4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenylyl)-2-phenyldiazopropane (1a) efficiently transform into colorless (Z)-1-(4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenylyl)-2-phenylpropene [(Z)-3a] in up to 96% yield in a highly selective photochemical solid-to-solid reaction. The solid state reaction was shown to proceed via a carbene intermediate, and it was formulated as a 1,2-H shift with unprecedented stereoselectivity. It was shown that irradiation of 1a in inert solvents gives products via 1,2-H shifts [(Z)-3a and (E)-3a] and 1,2-Ph migrations [(Z)-4a and (E)-4a] in yields that vary strongly with the polarity of solvent. Irradiation of 1a in ethanol gave similar products along with ethers 5a from insertion of the carbene into the EtO\xe2\x88\x92H bond. "
"Pentalene (1) is generated for the first time in argon matrices by photocleavage of the corresponding dimer (2). It is found that the cleavage occurs in two distinct steps, the first of which leads presumably to a diradical. 1 is characterized by its electronic and vibrational absorption spectra which are assigned and interpreted with reference to different quantum chemical calculations. These show that the first two excited states of pentalene involve a doubly excited configuration which had been ignored in previous discussion of the electronic structure. Due to the antiaromatic nature of pentalene, the distortive force of the \xcf\x80-electrons which favor a C2h structure with localized single and double bonds predominates over the effect of the \xcf\x83-electrons which drive the molecule to a D2h structure.

"The cation radicals of benzyltrialkylsilanes have been generated using photoinduced electron transfer and characterized using transient absorption spectroscopy. Absolute rate constants for nucleophile-assisted C\xe2\x88\x92Si bond cleavage have been determined, for different nucleophiles in different solvents and with different substituents on the phenyl ring. The short lifetime (<10-9 s) of the parent benzyltrimethylsilane cation radical in acetonitrile was unambiguously shown to be due to a rapid nucleophile-assisted bond cleavage, with the solvent acting as the nucleophile. Even in less polar solvents, such as dichloromethane, the lifetime of benzyltrimethylsilane cation radical is quite short (ca. 20 ns) unless trace amounts of water, which acts as an efficient nucleophile, are removed. Consistent with the nucleophile-assisted cleavage mechanism for the benzyltrialkylsilanes, sterically-demanding substituents on silicon decrease the rate constant for cleavage by as much as 4 orders of magnitude, depending upon the nucleophile. Similarly, increasing steric crowding on the nucleophile also decreases the rate constant, although smaller changes in the rate constants are observed. Electron-donating substituents (4-methyl and 4-methoxy) on the phenyl group also lead to a substantial decrease in the rate constant for cleavage of the cation radicals. When measurements are performed in the least nucleophilic solvent and under conditions that minimize contributions from adventitious nucleophiles, the lifetimes of the cation radicals of the benzyltrialkylsilanes can be so long that the rate of pseudo-first-order decay can not be accurately determined. If the cation radicals undergo unimolecular C\xe2\x88\x92Si bond cleavage (i.e., not nucleophile-assisted) under these conditions, the rate constant for this process is estimated to be less than 104 s-1.

"A mathematical model, based on reactions of independent functional groups, is derived to describe kinetic resolutions of bifunctional meso/dl stereoisomeric mixtures. The model indicates that only the slow reacting enantiomer can be obtained (as recovered starting material) with high stereoisomeric purity in these processes; the products from the fast reacting enantiomer and the meso diastereomer are predicted to have limited diastereoisomeric purity. Recycling strategies are presented that can serve to enhance the purity of the these products. In particular, if recycling can be performed using a reaction with selectivity opposite to that in the first cycle, it is predicted that all three components of a meso/dl mixture (or their derived products) can be obtained with high stereoisomeric purity, even from a process with modest enantiotopic group selectivity. These predictions were tested by Sharpless epoxidation of a 1:1 mixture of meso and racemic stereoisomers of 6,6-ethylenedioxy-1,10-undecadiene-3,9-diol (1) under conditions of high (40:1) and modest (9:1) selectivity. In both scenarios, the two C2 enantiomers and the monoepoxide derivative of the meso diastereomer of 1 were obtained with high stereoisomeric purity (\xe2\x89\xa597% dp, >99% ee) from an initial l-tartarate mediated epoxidation of the mixture followed by recycling of the mono- and diepoxide fractions by deoxygenation (KSeCN) and reepoxidation using a D-tartarate derived catalyst. The results are in reasonable agreement with those calculated with the mathematical model. "
The resonance Raman spectra of the metal-to-metal charge transfer (MMCT) mixed-valence complex [(OC)5Cr0\xe2\x88\x92CN\xe2\x88\x92OsIII(NH3)5](CF3SO3)2 are measured and analyzed. The excitation profiles (the Raman intensities as a function of excitation wavelength) are obtained using the SO3 stretch of the triflate ion as an internal standard. The ratios of the Raman intensities are not constant with different excitation wavelengths. This unusual observation is attributed to interference between two overlapping electronic states of the molecule. The electronic states are observed in the low-temperature polarized single crystal absorption spectrum. The resonance Raman intensities and excitation profiles are calculated with the time dependent theory of spectroscopy and include the interference between the electronic states. The origin of the unusual intensities is quantitatively explained in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the Raman cross sections from the two states. 
"The geometric structure of the catalytically relevant ferrous active site of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) has been investigated using magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and X-ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopies. From the excited state ligand field transitions in the MCD spectrum (10Dq = 9400 cm-1, \xce\x945Eg = 1800 cm-1), the temperature and field dependence of these transitions (\xce\x945T2g = 590 cm-1), and the XAS pre-edge shapes and intensities, the resting ferrous site of the \xe2\x80\x9ctense\xe2\x80\x9d form of PAH is six-coordinate distorted octahedral. The low ligand field strength observed in the MCD spectrum results from significant oxygen ligation and longer Fe\xe2\x88\x92O/N bond distances relative to model complexes as determined from an EXAFS analysis. Nonallosteric activation using N-ethylmaleimide does not notably affect the band positions in the MCD spectrum and therefore does not perturb the structure of the iron center. However, substrate addition without allosteric activation results in a different six-coordinate distorted octahedral structure as determined by MCD (10Dq = 10\xe2\x80\x89000 cm-1, \xce\x945Eg = 1450 cm-1) and XAS with a greater d\xcf\x80-orbital splitting (\xce\x945T2g = 1050 cm-1). EXAFS analysis indicates a shift in the relative number of ligands from the outer to the inner subshell of the first coordination sphere in the substrate-bound form of the enzyme relative to the resting site, consistent with the increased ligand field strength observed directly from the MCD spectrum. Substrate-induced allosteric activation (\xe2\x88\xbc34 kcal/mol) does not alter the structure of the iron site in the \xe2\x80\x9crelaxed\xe2\x80\x9d form of PAH compared to the substrate-bound \xe2\x80\x9ctense\xe2\x80\x9d state. Thus, while activation is necessary for the enzyme to achieve complete catalytic competence, it does not appear to affect the geometry of the catalytically relevant six-coordinate ferrous active site and only directly influences the surrounding protein conformation. In contrast, substrate addition results in a geometric and electronic structural change at the iron center which may help orient the substrate for completely coupled hydroxylation. "
"We have studied iron porphyrin complex-catalyzed oxygenations of hydrocarbons by several oxidants (i.e., hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA)) in the presence of H218O. In the olefin epoxidation and alkane hydroxylation reactions catalyzed by (meso-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphinato)iron(III) chloride [Fe(F20TPP)Cl], the percentages of 18O incorporated into the oxygenated products were found to be the same in all of the reactions of hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and MCPBA, leading us to conclude that a common high-valent iron oxo complex was the reactive intermediate responsible for oxygen atom transfer. When the epoxidation of cyclooctene by MCPBA and H2O2 was performed at low temperature in the presence of H218O, it was found that there was no 18O-incorporation from labeled water into cyclooctene oxide. We interpreted the lack of 18O-incorporation in these reactions with that an electronegatively-substituted iron porphyrin complex forms a relatively stable (Porp)FeIII\xe2\x88\x92OOR species and this intermediate transfers its oxygen to olefin prior to the O\xe2\x88\x92O bond cleavage at low temperature. As the reaction temperature raised from \xe2\x88\x9278 \xc2\xb0C to room temperature, the amount of 18O incorporated into the oxide product gradually increased in the reactions of cyclooctene epoxidation. This was attributed to the fast conversion of FeIII\xe2\x88\x92OOR to the high-valent iron oxo complex via the O\xe2\x88\x92O bond cleavage at higher temperature. We found, by studying the effects of the olefin and H218O concentrations on the amount of 18O incorporated into the oxide product, that the rate of the oxygen exchange between high-valent iron oxo complex and labeled water was slower than that of the oxygen atom transfer from the intermediate to organic compounds in catalytic oxygenation reactions. Blocking an axial position of iron porphyrin complex with imidazole prevented the 18O-incorporation from labeled water into the oxygenated products, explaining the phenomenon of no oxygen exchange in cytochrome P-450 systems.

"The structure and function of the prototypical dinuclear hydrolase, namely, the aminopeptidase from Aeromonas proteolytica (AAP), was probed by EPR spectroscopy of the mono- and dicobalt(II)-substituted derivatives. A new systematic protocol for the interpretation of Co(II) EPR spectra is described and the S = 3/2 spin states of the Co(II)-substituted forms of the enzyme have been characterized. This protocol allows the simulation of line shape using theoretically allowed geff values corresponding to an isotropic greal value. In addition, the gross distortion of EPR spectra of high-spin S = 3/2 Co(II) ions has been investigated, and the effects of saturation on the line shapes and on simulation-derived spectral parameters are discussed. For [Co-(AAP)], a distinctive EPR signal was observed in which the hyperfine pattern due to 59Co was not centered on the low-field absorption feature, and the signal could not be simulated as a single species. Subtraction of EPR spectra recorded at different temperatures revealed that two species were, in fact, present in samples of [Co-(AAP)]. The first species was a relatively featureless axial signal with geff values of 5.75, 4.50, and 2.50. These values correspond to an Ms = |\xc2\xb11/2\xe3\x80\x89 ground-state transition with greal = 2.57 and E/D = 0.08. The second species had geff values of 6.83, 2.95, and 1.96 and exhibited a characteristic eight-line 59Co hyperfine pattern with Az = 7.2 mT. The observed 59Co hyperfine lines were simulated in both line width as well as signal intensity for the first time. These parameters correspond to the Ms = |\xc2\xb11/2\xe3\x80\x89 ground-state transition with greal = 2.57; however, the signal exhibited marked rhombicity (E/D = 0.28), consistent with a highly distorted tetrahedral Co(II) species. The possibility that the spectrum could be due to contributions from the Ms = |\xc2\xb11/2\xe3\x80\x89 and Ms = |\xc2\xb13/2\xe3\x80\x89 doublets of a single spin system was investigated, but subtraction of spectra recorded at various temperatures clearly indicated that the features at g = 2.95 and g = 1.96 were correlated with the feature at g = 6.83. In addition, at temperatures above 15 K, the signal intensity rapidly decreases and the signal is lost. The EPR spectrum of [CoCo(AAP)] reveals a relatively featureless signal that was simulated as a single species with geff(1,2,3) values of 5.10, 3.85, and 2.19; Ms = |\xc2\xb11/2\xe3\x80\x89; greal = 2.25; E/D = 0.095. The intensity of the observed signal for [CoCo(AAP)] corresponded to 0.13 spin/mol of Co(II). These data strongly suggest that the two Co(II) ions in the active site of AAP experience significant spin\xe2\x88\x92spin interaction and are either antiferromagnetically or ferromagnetically coupled. Perpendicular mode EPR titration of apo-AAP with Co(II) revealed a low-field signal extending out of zero-field in samples with more than 1 equiv of Co(II) added. This type of EPR absorption is indicative of an integral spin system. Coincident with the appearance of the low-field perpendicular mode signal was the appearance of a parallel mode EPR signal with g \xe2\x88\xbc 12. These data represent the first definitive evidence for ferromagnetic coupling between two high-spin S = 3/2 Co(II) ions in a dinuclear center. The effect of pH, added peroxide, and the coordination of the competitive inhibitor 1-butaneboronic acid (BuBA) on the signal both confirm the origin of the signal and provide important mechanistic information for this novel dicobalt(II) active site cluster. Based on the present study and the available literature data, a detailed mechanism of action is proposed for AAP. "
"The preparation and characterization of the [2Ga-2S] analog of the [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin from vegetative cells of the cyanobacterium Anabaena 7120, a prototypical plant-type ferredoxin, is described. The novel metal-substituted analog was obtained through constitution of the apoprotein with Ga(III) and sulfide anion in argon-saturated aqueous buffer. The replacement product migrated identically with the diferric protein on a 15% native PAGE gel and contained 2 atom equiv of gallium and sulfide per mole of protein, according to inductively coupled plasma and colorimetric analysis, respectively. The EXAFS spectrum of the gallium\xe2\x88\x92sulfide constituted protein indicated the presence of a [2Ga-2S] cluster with structural features similar to those of [2Fe-2S] clusters. Cross peaks from nuclei that were not affected by the paramagnetism of the iron\xe2\x88\x92sulfur cluster in two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of the [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin appeared at chemical shifts essentially equivalent to those arising from analogous nuclei in the spectra of the [2Ga-2S] protein. Spectra of the gallium derivative, however, also possessed additional resonances; for example, 19 additional H\xce\xb1\xe2\x88\x92HN cross peaks were observed in the fingerprint region of the DQF-COSY spectrum of the [2Ga-2S] protein taken in H2O at 298 K. Sequential assignment of the resonances confirmed that the additional cross peaks originated from amino acids in the vicinity of the metal\xe2\x88\x92sulfur cluster, which were hyperfine-shifted or broadened beyond detectability in the iron\xe2\x88\x92sulfur protein spectra. Preliminary analysis of the NMR spectra indicated that the structural features of the gallium\xe2\x88\x92sulfide constituted protein possessed many similarities to those of the [2Fe-2S] protein in the crystalline state. Gallium-substituted analogs of iron\xe2\x88\x92sulfur proteins should find utility in characterization of the structural and functional features of the ferric forms of the native iron\xe2\x88\x92sulfur proteins using conventional NMR techniques.

"The molecular mechanism of the \xce\xb1-chlorocyclobutanone transposition to yield cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, as a model of the Favorskii rearrangement, has been theoretically characterized in vacuo by means of ab initio molecular orbital procedures at the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock (HF) level of theory with the 6-31G* and 6-31+G* basis sets. The electron correlation has been estimated at the MP2/6-31G* level and calculations based on density functional theory, BLYP/6-31G*. The solvent effects are included at HF/6-31G* level by means of a polarizable continuum model. The questions related to the two accepted molecular mechanisms, the semibenzilic acid and the cyclopropanone transpositions, as well as the competition between both reaction pathways are addressed in this investigation. The dependence of the geometries of the stationary structures along the corresponding reaction pathways and the transition vectors associated with the transition structures upon theoretical methods is discussed. The analysis of the results shows that the electrostatic solute\xe2\x88\x92solvent interactions modify appreciably the topology of the potential energy surface. The cyclopropanone mechanism is stabilized with respect to the semibenzilic acid mechanism, but this latter remains the energetically favorable reactive channel both in vacuo and in solution. The semibenzilic acid mechanism is a two-step process and the rate-limiting step corresponds to the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl ion on the carbon atom of the carbonyl group belonging to the \xce\xb1-chlorocyclobutanone ring. In the cyclopropanone mechanism three transition structures appear along the energy profile and the rate-limiting step is the dehydration process of the bicyclo[1.1.0]2-butanone intermediate with concomitant ring contraction and formation of the cyclopropanecarboxylic acid product.

"Ab initio MO calculations for the concerted 1,3-silyl migration in allylsilane at Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock and multiconfigurational levels revealed the existence of two transition structures (TS), which lead to retention and inversion of stereochemistry at the silicon. The two structures are pentacoordinate square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal around the silicon atom, respectively. The energy barriers estimated at various levels of calculation, including those with electron correlation effects, indicate that the retention transition structure is ca. 9 kcal/mol more stable than the inversion transition structure, in contrast to the experimental results of Kwart et al. Introduction of a \xcf\x80 system, such as a vinyl group, at the silicon stabilizes the inversion TS more than the retention TS. Similar transition structures and energetics were obtained for 1,3-migration in allylgermane and allylstannane using effective core potentials for Ge and Sn. "
"Polysiloxanes represent an important class of industrial polymers. Traditionally, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) can be prepared by base-catalyzed ring-opening of cyclic dimethylsiloxanes. Ab initio electronic calculations were conducted to examine a reaction path for the KOH catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D3). The overall picture that emerges is initial side-on attack by KOH on a Si\xe2\x88\x92O bond in the D3 ring leading to a stable addition complex with a 5-fold coordinated Si atom. The reacth path leads to a five-coordinate transition state, then to a stable insertion product (KOH inserts into the ring). The relative stability of a ring-opened product HO[Si(CH3)2O]3K is also considered. The energy along the reaction path was modeled both in the gas phase and in a moderately polar solvent (tetrahydrofuran, THF). The solvation energy was calculated using a recent implementation of an electrostatic model, where the solute molecule is placed in a non-spherical cavity in a dielectric continuum. The effect of basis set and electron correlation on the gas-phase energy and the effect of basis set on the solvation energy was studied. Along the solvated reaction path calculated at the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock level (with a 6-31G* basis set for the Si and O atoms), the apparent transition state energy is nearly equal to the reactants energy and is 4 kcal/mol above the addition complex energy.

"The 248-nm laser flash photolysis of methyl isothiocyanate (MeNCS) was used to generate S(3PJ) ground state atoms in acetonitrile solution. The reaction of S(3PJ) atoms with the MeNCS precursor produces molecular diatomic sulfur S2(3\xce\xa3g-) in its ground state, which possesses an absorption at ca. 270 nm. The first-order growth of this absorption was used to monitor the decay kinetics of the sulfur (3PJ) atoms and to measure the rate constants for their reactions with additives. The rate constants obtained for a number of olefins, e.g., 9.7 \xc3\x97 107 M-1 s-1 for ethyl vinyl ether, hydrogen donors, e.g., 3.1 \xc3\x97 109 M-1 s-1 for tributyltin hydride, sulfur atom donors, e.g., 5.0 \xc3\x97 107 M-1 s-1 for carbon disulfide, and nucleophiles, e.g., 1.3 \xc3\x97 109 M-1 s-1 for chloride ions, demonstrate that S(3PJ) atoms behave as reactive, yet very selective, intermediates in solution; the highest reactivity was observed toward nitrogen and phosphorus nucleophiles, e.g., 1.2 and 2.1 \xc3\x97 1010 M-1 s-1 for hydrazine and triethyl phosphite. The comparison with known nucleophilicity constants, e.g., for methyl iodide as electrophile, suggests further that S(3PJ) atoms act as potent but relatively soft electrophiles. The reaction modes between S(3PJ) atoms and the additives are assumed to involve abstractions of single atoms or addition to double bonds or lone electron pairs. The reaction rate constants for atomic sulfur S(3PJ) in solution are compared with previous gas phase data for S(3PJ) atoms and with the data for oxygen (3PJ) atoms in solution. "
"The interactions of various pyrimidines (1,3-dimethylthymine, DMT, 1,3-bis(N4,N4-dimethylcytosin-1-yl)propane, DMC) and their corresponding cis-syn cyclobutane dimers (DMTD and DMCD) with a series of excited-state electron donors were examined with the goal of understanding the energetics and mechanism of UV repair by DNA photolyase. For each substrate there is a good correlation between the excited state oxidation potential (Eox*) and the quenching rate constant (kq). The value for kq increases as Eox* becomes more negative, asymptotically approaching a value that is at or below the solvent diffusion limit. These data all showed good fits to the Rehm\xe2\x88\x92Weller equation. Reduction potentials for each of the substrates could be extracted from this analysis:\xe2\x80\x89 \xe2\x88\x922.20 V (vs SCE) for DMTD; \xe2\x88\x922.14 V for DMT; \xe2\x88\x922.17 V for DMCD; and \xe2\x88\x922.16 for DMC. These values show that the initial electron transfer step in the photolyase mechanism is exergonic by ca. 10\xe2\x88\x9215 kcal/mol. Thus these data support the reductive electron transfer mechanism for DNA photolyases proposed by Jorns et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 1987, 262, 486\xe2\x88\x92491). "
"The available experimental data on the electron donor (D)\xe2\x88\x92acceptor (A) coupling (HDA) for electron-transfer (ET) reactions in proteins are re-examined. In spite of their structural and energetic similarities, the photosynthetic reaction center and other ET protein systems exhibit a marked difference of the exponential decay of HDA with the distance separating D and A. A numerical study shows that this difference is explained in terms of very small variations of the energetics between these two classes of proteins. "
"23Na MAS NMR and synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction methods have been used to study the binding of hydrofluorocarbon-134 (HFC-134, CF2HCF2H) in zeolite NaY. A contraction of the volume of the unit cell is observed on gas adsorption, and the interaction of HFC-134 with the extraframework sodium cations is so strong that extraframework sodium cations in the sodalite cages (site I\xe2\x80\x98) migrate into the supercages. These sodium cations are found on positions close to the site III\xe2\x80\x98 positions of zeolite NaX. Both ends of the HFC molecules are bound to sodium cations, the HFC molecule bridging the site II and III\xe2\x80\x98 cations in the supercages. The strong cation\xe2\x88\x92HFC interaction results in a considerable displacement of the sodium site II cation along the [111] direction into the supercage and an increase in the T\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92T bond angle for the three oxygen atoms coordinated to this cation. A decrease in the 23Na quadrupole coupling constant on HFC adsorption from 4.4 to less than 2.8 MHz, for the sodium cations originally located in the sodalite cages (site I\xe2\x80\x98), is consistent with the sodium cation migrations.

"Ab initio MO calculations at the MP2/6-311G** level of theory show that the thiosulfoxide H2SS is 143 kJ mol-1 less stable than the disulfane HSSH, separated by an activation barrier of 210 kJ mol-1. Using much higher levels of theory, these results are only slighty changed, proving the suitability of the economical MP2/6-311G** scheme for the present purpose. At the same level Me2SS is 84 kJ mol-1 less stable than MeSSMe, with the transition state lying 340 kJ mol-1 above MeSSMe. Thermal isomerization of HSSH or MeSSMe can therefore be excluded, and H2SS and Me2SS should be kinetically stable toward unimolecular isomerization at low temperatures. Vibrational wavenumbers for H2SS and Me2SS are given. The allyl methyl thiosulfoxide MeAllSS is 83 kJ mol-1 less stable than the disulfane MeSSAll, but isomerization of the latter requires only 110 kJ mol-1. The corresponding RSSR and R2SS structures for R = Pr and All have been calculated at the HF/6-31G* level. The bimolecular decomposition of dimethyl thiosulfoxide to dimethyl sulfide and S2 is exothermic but spin-forbidden in the case of triplet S2, and endothermic but spin-allowed when singlet S2 is formed. The reactions of Me2SS with sulfur molecules Sx (x > 2) to give Me2S and Sx+1 are exothermic. "
"The coupling of electron self exchange reactions with physical diffusion has been used to measure electron transfer rate constants in a series of undiluted metal complex molten salts [M(bpy(CO2MePEG)2)3](ClO4)2 where M = Co(II/I) and Fe(III/II) and MePEG is an oligomeric polyether of MW 150, 350, and 550. Physical self-diffusion rates in the melts vary with attached polyether chain length by over 103-fold while the electron transfer rate constants show no strong systematic dependence. The electron transfer rates and activation parameters indicate that the metal complex cores move rapidly within their attached polyether \xe2\x80\x9csolvent\xe2\x80\x9d shells relative to the rates of electron transfers, which are near adiabatic with large activation barriers reflecting the apparent inability of the attached polyether chains to act as a freely mobile \xe2\x80\x9csolvent\xe2\x80\x9d. Ionic conductivities of the melts were measured in order to inspect for ionic and electronic migration effects which are present to minor degrees. Diffusion and heterogeneous transfer rates are also reported for dilute solutions of the cobalt complexes in a polyether solvent. "
"Chemical force microscopy (CFM) was used to probe interactions between ionizable and neutral functional groups in aqueous solutions. Force microscope probe tips and sample substrates have been covalently modified with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) terminating in distinct functional groups. SAMs were prepared by treating Au-coated or uncoated tips and substrates with functionalized thiols or silanes, respectively. A force microscope has been used to characterize adhesive and frictional interactions between probe tips and substrates modified with SAMs that terminate in \xe2\x88\x92NH2, \xe2\x88\x92COOH, \xe2\x88\x92OH, and \xe2\x88\x92CH3 functional groups as a function of solution pH and ionic strength. In general, adhesion and friction forces were observed to depend on the chemical identity of the tip and sample surface and also were found to be highly sensitive to the changes in the ionization state of the terminal functionalities induced by varying the solution pH. Adhesion measurements made as a function of pH (force titrations) on amine-terminated surfaces exhibit a sharp decrease in the adhesion force at pH values below 4.5. The pKa estimated from this drop in adhesion, which is due to the protonation of amine groups on the sample and tip, 3.9, is similar to the value determined by conventional contact angle wetting studies of these same surfaces. The large decrease in the pK of the amine group relative to homogeneous solution was attributed to the relatively hydrophobic environment of the amine group in these SAMs. Adhesion measurements made as a function of pH on \xe2\x88\x92COOH-terminated surfaces exhibited a large drop in adhesion force for pH values greater than 5. The pKa estimated from these data, 5.5, is similar to the free aqueous solution value. In addition, the adhesion force between nonionizable \xe2\x88\x92OH and \xe2\x88\x92CH3 groups was found to be independent of solution pH. The measured adhesive forces were interpreted using a contact mechanics model that incorporated the effects of the double layer free energy. Analyses of repulsive electrostatic forces and adhesion data recorded as a function of ionic strength were used to determine properties of the double layer. The pH dependence of the friction force between tips and samples modified with SAMs terminating in \xe2\x88\x92COOH, \xe2\x88\x92OH, and \xe2\x88\x92CH3 groups was measured as a function of applied load. For a given pH, these data exhibit a linear dependence on load with the slope corresponding to the coefficient of friction. The coefficient of friction for \xe2\x88\x92OH and \xe2\x88\x92CH3 groups was independent of pH, while the friction coefficient for \xe2\x88\x92COOH-terminated surfaces drops significantly at a pH corresponding to the pKa determined by adhesion measurements. The pH-dependent changes in friction forces for ionizable groups were exploited to map spatially changes in ionization state on surfaces terminating in \xe2\x88\x92COOH and \xe2\x88\x92OH functional groups.

"Ab initio calculations have been carried out on the [glycine\xe2\x88\x92Cu]+, [serine\xe2\x88\x92Cu]+, and [cysteine\xe2\x88\x92Cu]+ complexes. Investigation of several types of structures for each complex shows that the preferred binding site of Cu+ involves chelation between the carbonyl oxygen and the amino nitrogen. With glycine, this leads to a complexation energy (best estimate of D0) of 64.3 kcal/mol. Additional chelation with the alcohol group of serine or the thiol group of cysteine leads to larger binding energies, with cysteine binding more strongly than serine, in good agreement with a recent experimental scale of relative Cu+ affinities of all \xce\xb1-amino acids present in natural peptides. Combining this scale to the accurate determination of the Cu+ affinity of glycine from the present work leads to absolute values of Cu+ affinities of all amino acids. Calculations were also carried out on the complexes of Cu+ with water, ammonia, formaldehyde, and hydrogen sulfide. The geometrical and electronic structures of these complexes are used to analyze the binding of Cu+ to amino acids. "
"The thymidine stereoisotopomer, (2\xe2\x80\x98S)-[2\xe2\x80\x98-2H]thymidine, which incorporates deuterium in the S configuration at the furanosyl 2\xe2\x80\x98 carbon, has been synthesized and its vibrational spectra have been recorded and compared with those of normal thymidine. Infrared and Raman spectra were collected from crystalline powders, the latter using 1063- and 514.5-nm excitations; ultraviolet resonance-Raman spectra were collected from aqueous solutions using 244-nm excitation. The results show, remarkably, that virtually all normal modes of thymidine involve some degree of vibrational coupling between the thymine base residue and the deoxyribose moiety. Nevertheless, systematic assignments and correlation of the spectral frequencies of thymidine and (2\xe2\x80\x98S)-[2\xe2\x80\x98-2H]thymidine have been accomplished. A finding of importance for nucleic acid structure applications is that many prominent Raman marker bands of thymidine, assigned previously as thymine ring vibrations, in fact involve appreciable coupling with the C2\xe2\x80\x98 methylene group of the attached sugar. Vibrational coupling between the base and sugar groups implies frequency dependence upon sugar conformation and allows the bands in question to be exploited as markers of deoxyribose ring pucker and glycosyl orientation in Raman spectra of DNA, antiviral drugs, and other thymine-containing nucleoside analogues. The present results also enable unambiguous and novel assignment of spectral bands to specific vibrational modes of the C2\xe2\x80\x98 methylene group of thymidine as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 C2\xe2\x80\x98H2 antisymmetric stretching (2995 cm-1), symmetric stretching (2956 cm-1), scissoring (1404 cm-1), and wagging (1174 cm-1). Additionally, probable assignments are deduced for the C2\xe2\x80\x98H2 twisting (1103 cm-1) and rocking modes (898 cm-1). Normal mode assignments are also proposed for many other vibrational bands of thymidine. "
"The gas-phase conformations of a series of isolated N-phenylamides have been determined from vibrationally resolved electronic spectra obtained by resonant two-photon ionization in a supersonic jet expansion. Both the cis and trans isomers of formanilide were identified, with the cis isomer in 6.5% abundance. The spectral features displayed by this isomer are consistent with a nonplanar geometry which undergoes a large change in the phenyl torsional angle following electronic excitation. The more abundant trans isomer of formanilide adopts a planar structure and is stabilized by 2.5 kcal/mol with respect to the cis isomer. In the excited electronic state the relative stabilities of the two isomers are reversed. Acetanilide, in contrast, is found exclusively as the trans isomer, also having a planar structure. N-Methyl substitution causes a reversal of the relative isomer stabilities found in formanilide and leads to an isomer distribution consisting of approximately 90% E and 10% Z in N-methylformanilide. These experimental observations are compared to previous condensed phase structural determinations as well as to the relative energies and structures predicted from ab initio Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock geometry optimizations.

"The chemistry initiated by C60x+ (with x = 1, 2, and 3) in allene and propyne has been tracked in the gas phase. Reaction rate coefficients and product distributions were measured with the Selected-Ion Flow Tube (SIFT) technique operating at 294 \xc2\xb1 3 K and at a helium buffer-gas pressure of 0.35 \xc2\xb1 0.01 Torr. C60\xe2\x80\xa2+ does not react with allene and propyne under SIFT conditions, but multiple addition was observed with C602+. Multiple addition was also observed in the reaction of propyne with C603+, but allene reacted only by electron transfer with this cation. Up to 16 molecules of allene were observed to add to C602+ with a remarkable periodicity in reactivity:\xe2\x80\x89 even-numbered adducts react approximately 10 times faster than odd-numbered adducts. Multi-collision induced dissociation (CID) experiments demonstrated that the observed multiple-adduct ions have a \xe2\x80\x9cball-and-chain\xe2\x80\x9d structure. Mechanisms are proposed for the sequential addition reactions and for the formation of C6H7+ and C9H12+ which was seen to compete with multiple addition in the reactions of allene with C602+ and of propyne with C603+. The multiple-addition reactions are proposed to occur by chain propagation. The periodicity in the rates of the reactions of allene with C60(allene)n2+ is attributed to differences in charge distribution and stability associated with an alternating formation of acyclic and cyclic structures.

"A systematic analysis of a series of donor- and/or acceptor-substituted tetraethynylethenes (TEEs, TEE = 3,4-diethynylhex-3-ene-1,5-diyne) was conducted by means of electrochemical analysis and ab initio calculations to determine the ability of the conjugated carbon core to promote electronic communication between pendant functionality. The electronic behavior as a function of the degree and pattern of substitution was examined and compared to the theoretical results. Experimentally, the study indicates that the electrochemically generated charges localize, since the presence of one redox center on the TEE core has a minimal effect on the redox characteristics of the other centers. Upon reduction of p-nitrophenyl-substituted TEEs, however, a decrease in bond length alternation in the TEE core and a corresponding increase in the phenyl rings were predicted by ab initio calculations. This cumulenic/quinoid structure was validated experimentally by the electrochemical isomerization of cis-1,6-bis(4-nitrophenyl)-3,4-bis{[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]methyl}hex-3-ene-1,5-diyne to its trans-isomer during cyclic voltammetry. Thus, the findings show that although the multiple p-nitrophenyl redox centers present on the TEE core apparently behave independently from one another in electrochemical reduction steps, delocalization of the incurred charges is effectively conveyed by the alkynes into the carbon framework. This delocalization imparts a sufficiently high single bond character to the central TEE double bond in the dianion to allow rotation and cis\xe2\x88\x92trans-isomerization. "
"A novel cyclic selenenamide 6 was prepared from the corresponding amido-substituted diselenide 5 by brominolysis and treatment with silver triflate. The selenenamide promotes the oxidation of phenylmethanethiol to the corresponding disulfide with tert-butyl hydroperoxide. It functions by reacting with the thiol to afford selenenyl sulfide 8, which undergoes further attack by the thiol to produce dibenzyl disulfide and selenol 9. The latter compound is oxidized by the hydroperoxide to the selenenic acid 10, which in turn reacts with additional thiol, thus regenerating the selenenyl sulfide and forming water as the byproduct. The original selenenamide therefore acts as a procatalyst in this process and is not regenerated, whereas the selenenyl sulfide is the true catalyst. The selenenyl sulfide was isolated in the absence of the hydroperoxide and was fully characterized. The selenol was not observed in the catalytic cycle, but its transient formation was supported by a crossover experiment in which selenenyl sulfide 8 underwent thiol interchange with (4-methoxyphenyl)methanethiol. The catalytic cycle strongly resembles the mechanism by which the selenium-containing enzyme glutathione peroxidase catalyzes the destruction of hydroperoxides in vivo through the concomitant oxidation of glutathione to the corresponding disulfide.

"The effect of various phenols and aromatic amines on the dynamics of the peroxidase-catalyzed aerobic oxidation of NADH was investigated. We demonstrate that several aromatic compounds may substitute for 2,4-dichlorophenol in inducing sustained oscillations and complex dynamics in the reaction. These aromatic compounds can also act as substrates in the classical peroxidase reaction. Since some of the aromatic compounds studied are naturally occurring substrates for peroxidases, we conjecture that oscillations and complex dynamics may well occur in the intact plant. "
"Carbohydrate\xe2\x88\x92protein binding interactions can be greatly amplified using the cluster or multivalent effect. In previous studies, sialylated multibranched l-lysine dendrimers were found to be potent inhibitors of the hemagglutination of human erythrocytes by Influenza viruses. In order to further the understanding of multivalency and its role in carbohydrate\xe2\x88\x92protein interactions, glycoconjugates with differing carbohydrate densities, conformations, and interglycosidic spacings must be prepared. The synthesis and biological testing of structurally similar divergent and tethered \xce\xb1-sialodendrimers are presented herein. \xce\xb1-Thiosialoside-containing dendrimers scaffolded on an orthogonally protected 3,3\xe2\x80\x98-iminobis(propylamine) core were efficiently prepared via Cbz-protecting group and HOBt/DIC coupling strategies. The potential of these sialodendrimers to cross-link and precipitate Limax flavus lectin (LFA) was confirmed by turbidimetric analysis. When tested in enzyme-linked lectin inhibition assays using human \xce\xb11-acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid) as coating antigen and horseradish peroxidase-labeled LFA for detection di- (31), tetra- (32), octa- (33), and hexadecavalent (34) divergent dendrimers showed IC50 values of 176, 11.8, 206, and 425 nM while the tethered structures with valencies of four (14), six (20), eight (25), and twelve (30) exhibited IC50 values of 58.7, 16.9, 17.5, and 8.22 nM, respectively. These data represent 3.5 (34) to 182 (30) fold increases in inhibitory potential over monovalent 5-acetamido-5-deoxy-d-glycero-\xce\xb1-d-galacto-2-nonulopyranosyl azide used as a standard (IC50 1500 nM). The tethered \xce\xb1-sialodendrimers appeared to have structural organizations more suitable than the divergent dendrimers for the solid phase inhibition of the binding of human \xce\xb11-acid glycoprotein to LFA. All \xce\xb1-sialodendrimers are currently being evaluated as inhibitors of human erythrocyte hemagglutination by Influenza viruses. "
"Complexes of the form [Os(NH3)5(L)](OTf)2 (where L = an unactivated arene or polyaromatic hydrocarbon) are readily protonated by triflic acid (HOTf) to generate stable arenium, naphthalenium, and anthracenium cations. A series of substituted anisole complexes were also investigated. The metal stabilizes the hydrocarbon arenium system, in most cases, by coordinating the organic ligand in an \xce\xb73 fashion. Where L = m-xylene, however, NMR data strongly suggest that the arenium ion is essentially dihapto-coordinated, where an allyl cation fragment remains uncoordinated. For the corresponding anisolium systems, NMR data indicate \xce\xb72-coordination. It is likely that \xce\xb72 and \xce\xb73 geometries represent limiting cases for a continuum of distorted allyl (pseudo-allyl) complexes. The pKa values determined for these complexes are dramatically higher than those of the free arenium cations. "
"A study of the hydrolysis of (CO)5CrC(OMe)Ph (1a), (CO)5CrC(OEt)Ph (1b), (CO)5CrC(OMe)CHCHPh (1c), (CO)5WC(OMe)Ph (1d), and (CO)5WC(OEt)Ph (1e) in 50% MeCN\xe2\x88\x9250% water (v/v) at 25 \xc2\xb0C is reported. The reaction occurs in two stages; the first is the formation of (CO)5MC(O-)R or (CO)5MC(OH)R (M = Cr or W, R = Ph or CHCHPh) while the second, much slower stage is the formation of RCHO and (CO)5MOH-. This paper reports a kinetic investigation of the first stage. It is shown that nucleophilic attack by OH- at high pH and by water at low pH, presumably to form a tetrahedral intermediate, is rate limiting; in the presence of buffers general base catalysis of water addition is observed. Kinetic solvent isotope effects of ca. 1 for the OH- and of 3 to 4.7 for the water pathways are also reported. The results lead to insights regarding the following points:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) effect of changing the metal (Cr vs W), the alkoxy group (MeO vs EtO), and the R group (Ph vs CHCHPh) on reactivity; (2) relative reactivity of Fischer carbene complexes vs carboxylic esters; (3) reasons why a tetrahedral intermediate is not detectable even though the equilibrium for its formation is probably favorable at high pH; and (4) reasons why the hydrolysis of Fischer carbene complexes containing an acidic proton such as (CO)5CrC(OMe)CH3 follow an entirely different mechanism.

"The first synthesis of dolastatin 11, a potent antineoplastic agent from the sea hare Dolabella auricularia, confirmed the proposed structure and established the last configuration in this natural product and in dolastatin 12, majusculamide C, and 57-normajusculamide C. "
"In order to study the effects carbohydrates have on glycoprotein structure and function, it is imperative to be able to synthesize the appropriate natural and non-natural glycoprotein variants in a single form. Because the available in vivo techniques provide only heterogeneous mixtures of different glycoforms, enzymatic in vitro methodologies have been pursued. Using the N-glycoprotein RNase B as a model system, the oligosaccharide was removed leaving only the N-acetylglucosamine as a \xe2\x80\x9ctag\xe2\x80\x9d to the site of glycosylation. Glycosyltransferases were then used to build a unique carbohydrate moiety. A new RNase glycoform containing the branched oligosaccharide, sialyl Lewis X or the Hg derivative, was synthesized enzymatically to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. In addition, the monoglycosylated protein was digested into several smaller pieces by subtilisin BPN\xe2\x80\x98. These fragments were religated by subtilisin 8397 to the full length RNase by addition of glycerol; this method points to a new chemical-enzymatic process for the synthesis of glycoproteins using synthetic peptides and glycopeptides as substrates for enzymatic ligation followed by further enzymatic glycosylations.

"It is proposed that members of the family of polycyclic aromatic compounds with an extended phenanthrene-like structural motif be designated as [n]phenacenes, where n is the number of fused benzene rings. [n]Phenacene molecules are related to layers of graphite in the way that ribbons are related to sheets. In order to investigate the properties of [n]phenacenes as materials, methods for the syntheses of these molecules have been developed that involve Wittig reactions and stilbene-like photocyclizations for the construction of carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon bonds. The solubilities of the unsubstituted [n]phenacene molecules decrease dramatically with increasing n; [7]phenacene, the largest known example, melts with decomposition at 565 \xc2\xb0C and is essentially intractable for chemical investigation owing to its extreme insolubility. This solubility problem was solved by incorporating alkyl substituents. 2,13-Di-n-pentyl[7]phenacene, 2,13-di-tert-butyl[7]phenacene, and 15,18-di-n-pentyl[7]phenacene (mp 325, 290, and 235 \xc2\xb0C, respectively) were synthesized and found to be moderately soluble compounds. As a first step in the exploration of the chemistry of larger phenacenes, 2,17,21,24-tetra-n-pentyl[11]phenacene was synthesized. "
"A mixture of equal amounts of CuBr\xe2\x88\x92SMe2, LiBr, and LiSPh in THF at 0 \xc2\xb0C furnished a new soluble copper catalyst that was highly efficient at coupling primary, secondary, tertiary, aryl, vinyl, and allylic Grignard reagents to primary tosylates and primary Grignard reagents to secondary tosylates and mesylates, all with the use of only 1 equiv of Grignard reagent. The new catalyst was shown to be much more reactive than copper catalysts CuBr and Li2CuCl4 and more efficient in the transference of secondary and tertiary alkyl groups than lower order cuprates (Gilman reagents) and demonstrated more reactivity than the lower order cuprates with its ability to couple primary Grignard reagents to secondary sulfonates. The Grignard reagent/catalyst system was compatible with an ester functionalized tosylate, thus proving to be more chemoselective than a Grignard reagent without the catalyst. The catalyst exhibited good reactivity below room temperature, and with the addition of 6% v/v of HMPA to the catalyst solution, excellent yields of coupled product were obtained within a 25\xe2\x88\x9267 \xc2\xb0C temperature range. 1H NMR demonstrated that the catalyst solution consisted of several species that most likely were composed of copper ligated with thiophenol, THF, and LiBr in aggregated forms.

"One-electron oxidation of copper(I) bis(1,4,7-trithiacyclononane), [CuI(TTCN-\xce\xba3)(TTCN-\xce\xba1)]+, 1, a coordination complex with a tetrahedral CuS4 core, to [CuII(TTCN-\xce\xba3)2]2+, 2, with an octahedral CuS6 core, has been studied by pulse radiolysis and electrochemistry in aqueous solution at various pH values. In addition to the geometry change about the metal ion in this oxidation, the nonchelating 1,4,7-trithiacyclononane (TTCN) ligand in 1 changes conformation on becoming chelated in 2. However, pulse radiolysis reveals that this process does not occur intramolecularly but affords a bimolecular reaction in which the oxidized copper incorporates an external TTCN. Evidence for this mechanism is drawn from corresponding experiments with a variety of related CuI complexes in which the monodentate TTCN has been replaced by other sulfur-containing ligands and which have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. From all these studies it is concluded that oxidation of 1 and all these other complexes of CuI is accompanied by immediate loss of the monodentate ligand generating [CuII(TTCN-\xce\xba3)(H2O)3]2+, 3. Transient 3 is characterized by an optical absorption with \xce\xbbmax = 370 nm and \xce\xb5 \xe2\x88\xbc 2000 M-1 cm-1 which depends on pH because this transient participates in three acid/base equilibria. Deprotonation of the three water ligands associated with Cu(II) results in increasingly blue-shifted absorptions. Undeprotonated transient 3 prevails at pH \xe2\x89\xa46, and converts directly into the stable CuII complex 2 via reaction with an unoxidized molecule of 1 or free TTCN. The corresponding bimolecular rate constants are 5.2 (\xc2\xb10.5) \xc3\x97 105 and 8.4 (\xc2\xb11.0) \xc3\x97 105 M-1 s-1, respectively. For the deprotonated forms of 3 this process is increasingly slowed down and at higher pH (\xe2\x89\xa59) the formation of 2 is completely prevented. The formation of transient 3 is also consistent with the pH dependence of the electrochemistry of 1. Under electrochemical conditions the conversion into 2 follows first-order kinetics due to a relatively high TTCN concentration available near the electrode surface after oxidation of 1. All the results require rapid ligand exchange in 1 and a particularly labile monodentate TTCN ligand. This has been corroborated by 1H NMR spectroscopic studies on 1. "
"To characterize the electrostatic complex formed between myoglobin (Mb) and cytochrome b5 (Feb5), we have performed flash photolysis triplet-quenching and electron-transfer (ET) measurements of the interaction between Zn deuteroporphyrin (ZnD)-substituted Mb (sperm whale) (ZnDMb) and Feb5(trypsin-solubilized, bovine) at pH values between 6 and 7.5. For pH values between pH 6 and pH 7.5, the quenching rate constant (\xce\x94k) varies linearly with [Fe3+b5]. The slope (M) obtained from plots of \xce\x94k versus [Fe3+b5] is strongly dependent on pH (M = 140 \xc3\x97 106 M-1 s-1 at pH 6 and M = 2.4 \xc3\x97 106 M-1 s-1 at pH 7.5). The triplet decay profiles remain exponential throughout these titrations. Together, these results indicate that the association constant obeys the inequality, Ka \xe2\x89\xa4 3000 M-1 and that the lower limit for the rate constant for dissociation of the 3DA complex of (koff)min = 106 s-1 at pH 6 and (koff)min = 104 s-1 at pH 7.5. Transient absorption measurements have shown that this quenching of 3ZnDMb by Fe3+b5 can be attributed to intracomplex 3ZnD \xe2\x86\x92 Fe3+P ET and that the transient absorbance changes observed at the 3D/D isosbestic points represent the time evolution of the (D+A-), [ZnD+Mb, Fe2+b5] intermediate, I. The long-time behavior of the progress curves (t \xe2\x89\xa5 20 ms) collected during a titration of Fe3+b5 by ZnDMb (reverse titration protocol) is neither purely second-order nor purely first-order but rather resembles a mixed-order process involving both the (D+A-) complex and its dissociated components. Modeling this data indicates that the D+A- complex product must dissociate with a rate constant slower than that of the precursor, DA, complex. Theoretical studies of the protein pair by Brownian dynamics simulations show that Mb has a broad reactive surface which encompasses the \xe2\x80\x9chemisphere\xe2\x80\x9d that includes the exposed heme edge. The most stable complexes occur when b5 is bound at one of two subdomains within this hemisphere. The kinetics measurements and calculations taken together allow us to discuss the relative importance of global and local electrostatics in regulating protein\xe2\x88\x92protein recognition and reactivity.

"1H-NMR spectral properties of two paramagnetic binuclear copper(II) complexes 1 and 2, which are weakly antiferro- and ferromagnetically coupled, respectively, in the solid state, have been studied in solution; corresponding parameters are compared to a mononuclear copper(II) analogue 1a. Compound 1 exhibits unusually sharp and hyperfine shifted ligand signals (+230 to \xe2\x88\x9214 ppm) that are about 100 times sharper than corresponding signals that could be detected for 1a (+20.4 to \xe2\x88\x9213 ppm). Complex 2 also displays moderately sharp signals, shifted even to a greater magnitude (+272 to 0 ppm). These observations are in contrast with other moderately antiferromagnetically coupled binuclear copper(II) systems where much broader signals are observed in addition to reduced hyperfine chemical shifts. A complete assignment of signals for 1 and 2 was accomplished by a combination of proton relaxation data and two-dimensional correlated spectroscopy (COSY) measurements, while for 1a only partial analysis could be performed because of broadness of its signals. An analysis of the relaxation data and a quantitative comparison among 1a, 1, and 2 show that the unusual spectral features observed for the weakly coupled binuclear copper(II) (S = 1/2) centers is caused by a two orders of magnitude decrease in the electron relaxation (\xcf\x84s = 10-11 s) as compared to \xcf\x84s = 10-9 s for the mononuclear copper(II) species, 1a. Shortening of \xcf\x84s for homobinuclear compounds is not otherwise predicted, and possible mechanisms for the results are discussed. The present findings are significant with respect to the factors determining electronic relaxation in magnetically coupled systems and to the understanding of proton NMR when applicable to binuclear copper(II) metalloproteins.

"A previously developed solid-state route (dimensional reduction) has led to the first molecular clusters containing the face-capped octahedral [Re6(\xce\xbc3-Q)8]2+ core (Q = S, Se). Among these is the protonated cluster [Re6Se7(SeH)I6]3-, whose substitution reactions have been examined in an effort to create a set of site-differentiated precursors for forming multicluster assemblies. Reaction with Et3P under reflux with different conditions of reactant mole ratio and time affords the clusters fac-[Re6Se8(PEt3)3I3]1- (2), trans- (3) and cis-[Re6Se8(PEt3)4I2] (4), [Re6Se8(PEt3)5I]1+ (5), and [Re6Se8(PEt3)6]2+ (6). The synthesis of fully substituted 6 in quantitative yield required the forcing conditions of 20 equiv of phosphine in refluxing DMF for 3 days. Reaction of 4 with AgBF4 in dichloromethane/acetonitrile gave cis-[Re6Se8(PEt3)4(MeCN)2]2+ (7); a similar reaction of 5 yielded [Re6Se8(PEt3)5(MeCN)]2+ (8) and that of [Re6Se7(SeH)I6]3- led to fully substituted [Re6Se8(MeCN)6]2+ (9). The structures of clusters 2\xe2\x88\x929 as Bu4N+ (2), iodide (5), SbF6- (7), or BF4- (6, 8, 9) salts were proven by X-ray crystallography. No significant variance was observed in the face-capped geometry of the core when bound by iodine, phosphine, and nitrile ligands alone or in combination. Terminal Re\xe2\x88\x92P/I/N bond lengths were similarly independent of co-ligands. The combination of ligands of different lability in clusters 2\xe2\x88\x929 should make them of considerable utility in producing linked cluster assemblies/materials wherein labile ligands are displaced by bridging ligands. The simplest of these reactions, the direct coupling of two [Re6Se8]2+ cluster cores, is demonstrated here. When thermolyzed at 180 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h under dynamic vacuum, the compounds [8]X2 (X = BF4-, SbF6-) lose acetonitrile and condense to form two new compounds containing the dicluster [Re12Se16(PEt3)10]4+ (10), whose structure has been established by X-ray methods. This cluster is composed of two [Re6Se8]2+ portions which are centrosymmetrically connected by two Re\xe2\x88\x92(\xce\xbc4-Se) bonds to form a rhomboidal Re2Se2 unit. The bridge bonds are ca. 0.1 \xc3\x85 longer than the Re\xe2\x88\x92(\xce\xbc3-Se) bonds of the remainder of the core; they have the same value as in the bridging rhombs present in the two-dimensional phase Re6Se8Cl2, which is a precursor solid to molecular [Re6Se8]2+ clusters by dimensional reduction. The synthesis of 10 is directed by the structure of 8, which can give only one logical product upon deligation of acetonitrile. The synthesis concept is potentially extendable to other types of oligomerized clusters. "
"Methanolysis of {t-Bu2In[\xce\xbc-P(SiMe3)2]}2 (1) in aromatic solvents gives polycrystalline InP fibers (dimensions 10\xe2\x88\x92100 nm \xc3\x97 50\xe2\x88\x921000 nm) at 111\xe2\x88\x92203 \xc2\xb0C. The chemical pathway consists of a molecular component, in which precursor substituents are eliminated, and a nonmolecular component, in which the InP crystal lattices are assembled. The two components working in concert comprise the solution\xe2\x88\x92liquid\xe2\x88\x92solid (SLS) mechanism. The molecular component proceeds through a sequence of isolated and fully characterized intermediates:\xe2\x80\x89 1 \xe2\x86\x92 [t-Bu2In(\xce\xbc-OMe)]2 (2) \xe2\x86\x92 [t-Bu2In(\xce\xbc-PHSiMe3)]2 (3) \xe2\x86\x92 2 \xe2\x86\x92 [t-Bu2In(\xce\xbc-PH2)]3 (4). Complex 4, which is alternatively prepared from t-Bu3In and PH3, undergoes alkane elimination, the last steps of which are catalyzed by the protic reagent MeOH, PhSH, Et2NH, or PhCO2H. In the subsequent nonmolecular component of the pathway, the resulting (InP)n fragments dissolve into a dispersion of molten In droplets, and recrystallize as the InP fibers. Important criteria are identified for crystal growth of covalent nonmolecular solids from (organic) solution. The outcomes of other solution-phase semiconductor syntheses are rationalized according to the functioning of molecular and nonmolecular pathway components of the kind identified here. "
"Molecular relaxation properties of the monosaccharides (a) d-glucose, (b) methyl \xce\xb2-d-glucopyranoside, (c) methyl \xce\xb1-d-mannopyranoside, (d) d-xylose, (e) d-arabinose, (f) methyl \xce\xb2-d-xylopyranoside, (g) methyl \xce\xb2-d-arabinopyranoside, (h) methyl \xce\xb1-l-(6-deoxy)mannopyranoside, and (i) 1,6-anhydro-\xce\xb2-d-glucopyranoside, all in aqueous solution, have been studied using broad band ultrasonic spectrometry in the frequency range 0.2\xe2\x88\x922000 MHz. Ultrasonic excess absorption with relaxation characteristics near 80 MHz was found for glucose and the methyl glucosides of d-glucose and d-mannose, but no relaxation process was detected for the other monosaccharides in the same frequency range. From structural aspects it is deduced that the most likely process causing the observed relaxation is the rotation of the exocyclic \xe2\x88\x92CH2OH group, placing rotational isomerization on the nanosecond time scale. Relaxation parameters for d-glucose and methyl \xce\xb2-d-glucopyranoside solutions were further investigated as a function of concentration and temperature, in order to confirm the assignment of the relaxation process, and to determine some of its thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.

"Photolysis of para,para\xe2\x80\x98-diazide precursors in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran gives biradical ESR spectra assignable to quinonoidal dinitrenes with excited triplet biradical states. The zero field splitting (zfs) parameters for the biradicals at 77 K are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 1,4-phenylenedinitrene (|D/hc| = 0.169 cm-1, |E/hc| = 0.004 cm-1); 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenyldinitrene (|D/hc| = 0.188 cm-1, |E/hc| \xe2\x89\xa4 0.002 cm-1); 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-stilbenedinitrene (|D/hc| = 0.122 cm-1, |E/hc| < 0.002 cm-1); 1,4-bis(p-nitrenophenyl)buta-1,3-diene (|D/hc| = 0.0865 cm-1, |E/hc| < 0.002 cm-1); 1,8-bis(p-nitrenophenyl)octa-1,3,5,7-tetraene (|D/hc| = 0.0442 cm-1, |E/hc| < 0.001 cm-1). These zfs parameters are inconsistent with simple dipole\xe2\x88\x92dipole analysis of the ESR spectra in localized biradicals, but are reconcilable with a spin-polarized model involving the \xcf\x80-electrons of the biradicals.

"Suitable parameter sets for the CHARMm force field were derived using the Dinur\xe2\x88\x92Hagler energy second-derivative procedure, on the basis of SCF calculations at the 6-31G* level, for the uncommon structural units in poly(phenoxyphosphazenes) [PN, PN, PX (X = aryloxy)]. It is shown that application of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in combination with experimental energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXD) measurements, provide unambiguous structural and conformational information on amorphous polymers. The procedure for the analysis of the EDXD data involves comparison of computed atom\xe2\x88\x92atom radial distribution function (RDF) curve from MD simulations for the various polymer backbone conformations, with the RDF obtained from experimental X-ray scattering data. The applicability of this combined experimental/computational methodology is illustrated on the amorphous poly[di(4-methylphenoxy)phosphazene] (PMPP). The results showed that (i) the backbone conformation is safely [TC]n rather than [T3C]n and (ii) the computed RDFs are best assessed by using a MD simulation technique that avoids assumption of static chain conformation and the needed best fit of the distance dependent parameters sjk. In this method of analysis, the RDF that to be compared with the experimental one is directly calculated from all microstates collected during the entire simulation period. Validation of the polymer model provides a complete picture, otherwise experimentally inaccessible, of the internal fluctuations of the polymeric chains. The computational protocol delineated for analysis of EDXD data is general and its application specifically necessary when highly flexible amorphous polymers are involved. "
"This contribution reports the first X-ray standing wave structural characterization of self-assembled NLO-active chromophoric multilayers (SAMs). These siloxane-based self-assembled stilbazolium multilayers are intrinsically acentric and exhibit very large second-order nonlinear optical responses. The locations of bromide ions within the SAMs were precisely determined using X-ray standing waves generated by total external reflection from mirror surfaces as well as by Bragg diffraction from layered synthetic microstructures. The large coherent fraction (i.e., small Gaussian distribution width) of the Br- ions provides direct evidence for the high structural regularity of these self-assembled multilayers along the surface normal direction. These results are supported by atomic force microscopic (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) studies which probe the structural regularity and chemical composition of SAMs, respectively. The anion surface coverage has also been measured in this study (2.5(5) \xc3\x97 1014 Br-/cm2) and is in excellent agreement with the cation surface coverage measured by second harmonic generation (2(1) \xc3\x97 1014 molecules/cm2). These results clearly demonstrate the utility of X-ray standing wave analyses as a quantitative microstructural probe for self-assembled mono- and multilayers, especially for SAMs with incommensurate structures.

"The conformation of the peptidoglycan monomer (PGM) from Brevibacterium divaricatum was determined in aqueous solution using a combined approach by 2D NMR spectroscopy, restrained simulated annealing, and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. MD simulations in water without experimental constraints provided insights into the structure and dynamics of this glycopeptide. Hierarchical cluster analyses for conformer classifications were performed using a global molecular shape descriptor (CoMFA steric fields). Principal component analysis was subsequently employed to extract orthogonal principal conformational properties. Correlated dihedral angle mobilities were identified using a dynamic cross correlation map. The calculation of radial distribution functions for all polar protons of the molecule leads to additional information about the solvation of PGM in a protic solvent, while autocorrelation functions for dihedral angle fluctuations were used to monitor dynamic processes in different regions. From simulated annealing, a set of 11 conformers was obtained, all characterized by a well-defined extended N-terminal peptide part additionally stabilized by the bound disaccharide; the C-terminal part, on the other hand, exhibits more conformational flexibility in agreement with experimental data and MD simulations. The disaccharide conformation is in agreement with the conformational minimum computed for the model disaccharide 3-O-Me-4-O-\xce\xb2GlcNAc-\xce\xb1MurNAc using various force fields. Not only the interglycosidic bond but also the glycopeptide linkage exists in a single, well-defined conformation, for which no conformational changes can be detected during the MD simulations. In contrast, conflicting experimental data for the N-acetyl group of GlcNAc could be explained using a conformer population analysis based on ROE intensities and coupling constants accounting for a conformational equilibrium with one dominantly populated rotamer.

"Electrostatic alternate adsorption was successfully employed for low-molecular-weight dyes, leading to a large variety of dye\xe2\x88\x92polyion layer-by-layer assemblies. The assembling process of individual dye\xe2\x88\x92polyion layers of Congo Red (CR)\xe2\x88\x92poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) was investigated by using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The in-situ QCM measurement revealed that the dye adsorption occurred at a rate similar to that of conventional polyion adsorption. Successful assembly of the CR layer was confirmed also by increasing intensities in the UV adsorption. The molecular aggregation within the dye layer was inferred from the observed absorption shift in the case of CR\xe2\x88\x92PDDA. Apparently, stable film formation is promoted by dye aggregation in the adsorbed layer, although the extent of film growth was independent of conceivable aggregation in the solution. Successive frequency decreases due to film growth were observed for other representative dyes under optimized conditions. Comparison of the film thickness estimated from QCM frequency shift with the molecular dimension of individual dyes suggests the formation of well-packed monomolecular dye layers that is affected by size, number of charge, and spatial orientation of dye molecules. The alternate layer-by-layer assembly is now extended from linear polyions to other macroions (proteins and inorganic plates) and charged small molecules. Advantages and disadvantages of the alternate assembly were discussed relative to those of the Langmuir\xe2\x88\x92Blodgett technique. "
"Ab initio MP2/6-31G(d,p) methods have been used to examine in detail the structures and relative energies of the conformers of glycolic acid and to investigate the pathways and energy barriers involved in possible conformational interconversions. From the results of these calculations it has been shown that if an adequate volatilization temperature is used then two glycolic acid species, not necessarily the two of lowest energy, should be detectable via free jet expansion microwave spectroscopy. We tested this prediction experimentally. The spectrum of a new species (y) was detected and shown via comparison of the predicted with observed rotational constants, planar moments of inertia, and isotopic substitution coordinates to be most consistent with the trans-carboxyl theoretical conformer {13,18} (see Figure 2). Previous microwave spectroscopy studies had found only one glycolic acid conformer (x). The detection of both (x) and (y) is fully consistent with the relative energy and conformer relaxation predictions from the ab initio calculations. Conformer (y) is similar to a species previously reported from matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy. "
"Ion mobility measurements have been used to examine the geometries of naked BPTI (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) and cytochrome c ions in the gas phase, as a function of charge. For BPTI, the measured cross sections are close to those estimated for the native solution-phase conformation. Furthermore, gas-phase BPTI retains its compact structure when collisionally heated. These results are consistent with the known stability of BPTI, where the three-dimensional structure is partly locked into place by three covalent disulfide bridges. For cytochrome c, geometries with cross sections close to those estimated for the native solution phase structure were observed for the low charge states. For intermediate charge states, the compact geometries are metastable, and when collisionally heated they gradually unfold, through a series of well-defined intermediates. Only extended conformations are observed for the higher charge states, and they become more extended as the charge increases. The gas-phase conformation of a protein ion results from a balance between attractive intramolecular interactions, intramolecular charge \xe2\x80\x9csolvation\xe2\x80\x9d, and Coulomb repulsion. For the low charge states, compact folded conformations have the lowest energy because they maximize intramolecular interactions. For intermediate charge states, elongated conformations, which minimize Coulomb repulsion while maximizing intramolecular interactions and intramolecular charge \xe2\x80\x9csolvation\xe2\x80\x9d, become favored. For the high charge states, the elongated conformations unravel to an extended string as Coulomb repulsion dominates. "
"We have measured the gas-phase electron affinities of indenyl and fluorenyl radicals to be 42.7 \xc2\xb1 0.3 and 43.1 \xc2\xb1 0.3 kcal/mol, respectively, by electron photodetachment spectroscopy, using an ion cyclotron resonance spectrometer to generate, trap, and detect ions. From the electron affinities and literature values for the gas-phase acidities, we derive the bond dissociation energies:\xe2\x80\x89 indene, 81.1 \xc2\xb1 2.4 kcal/mol and fluorene, 81.3 \xc2\xb1 2.4 kcal/mol. We describe a general approach for comparing gas and solution-phase ionic properties. "
"Polyacid cascade dendrimers (generations 1\xe2\x88\x924) are used as a pseudostationary phase for electrokinetic capillary chromatography to separate mixtures of neutral species. Separation of a homologous series of molecules allow the capacity factors and distribution coefficients to be calculated, which in turn allow the standard enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy for solubilization to be evaluated by van\'t Hoff analysis. Comparison of these values to analogous values measured for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles suggests fundamental differences in the thermodynamic quantities associated with solubilization. As the size of the polyacid dendrimer increases, entropy becomes the driving force for solubilization, and enthalpy is disfavored. Gibb\'s free energy values are negative for all of the dendrimer/analyte interactions investigated. The capacity factor is found to increase linearly with increasing concentrations of dendrimer. Thermodynamic parameters are evaluated for several small molecules to show that the technique is not limited to molecules that are part of a homologous series. "
"The stability of bridgehead carbocations has been determined by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance spectroscopy (FT ICR) based on dissociative proton attachment (DPA) of bromides and alcohols. The stability of the ions correlates with the solvolytic reactivity of bridgehead derivatives over a rate range of 23 log units, and with theoretical calculations for hydride transfer of bridgehead hydrocarbons at the MP2/6-311G** level. "
"We present a new method for attachment of self-cooled electrons to gas-phase neutrals of potentially low electron affinity. The cyclotron frequency of electrons in a Penning trap operated at 3 T is sufficiently high that 2 eV electrons injected into the trap from a hot filament cool themselves to room temperature (\xe2\x88\xbc0.02 eV) in \xe2\x88\xbc1 s by classical radiative emission. In fact, we show that radiative cooling can be much more efficient than cooling by electron\xe2\x88\x92neutral or electron\xe2\x88\x92electron collisions. Such cold electrons have high cross-section for attachment to gaseous neutrals of quite low electron affinity (<0.5 eV). Because both electrons and negative ions can be trapped simultaneously in a Penning trap, the negative ions so formed may be detected by FT-ICR mass spectrometry in the same Penning trap. Compared to conventional chemical ionization, the present method for producing negative ions requires no additional chemical reagent and can be conducted at relatively low pressure by use of pulsed-gas introduction of the sample. The method is demonstrated by successful electron attachment to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with electron affinities as low as 0.49 eV (anthracene) and 0.45 eV (pyrene). "
"The unimolecular decompositions of 5-methyl-7-trimethylsilylheptanenitrile (1) and 6-methyl-8-trimethylsilyloctanenitrile (2) complexed to \xe2\x80\x9cbare\xe2\x80\x9d Co+ cations have been investigated by means of tandem mass spectrometry. The Co+-mediated bond activations display a high degree of selectivity in that the major (>90%) neutral product formed is trimethylsilane. Regio- and diastereospecific labeling experiments were conducted to gain further insight into the mechanistic details, in particular, the unique regio- and stereoselectivity of the losses of trimethylsilane from 1/Co+ and 2/Co+, respectively. The reaction follows a clean 1,2-elimination process, in which the building blocks of the neutral HSiMe3 stem exclusively from activation of a C\xe2\x88\x92H bond in the (\xcf\x89 \xe2\x88\x92 1) position and the Si\xe2\x88\x92C bond. The observed regiospecificity can only be accounted for by invoking a metal-ion-mediated cooperation of the SiMe3 and the CN groups in the course of the multistep reaction sequence. The examination of diastereospecifically labeled isotopologues of 1 and 2 reveals a remarkably high diastereoselectivity for the desilylation, and the steric effects (SE) clearly exceed the kinetic isotope effects (KIE) associated with C\xe2\x88\x92H and C\xe2\x88\x92D bond activation, respectively; i.e., KIE = 1.6 \xc2\xb1 0.1 and SE = 4.1 \xc2\xb1 0.2 for 1/Co+, and KIE = 1.5 \xc2\xb1 0.1 and SE = 3.0 \xc2\xb1 0.2 for 2/Co+. These unprecedented examples for stereoselective C\xe2\x88\x92Si bond activations by Co+ in the gas phase can be rationalized in terms of steric interactions in the different conformations of the metallacyclic intermediates.

"Protonation sites in gaseous pyrimidine (1), 2-pyrimidinamine (2), and 4-pyrimidinamine (3) were elucidated by neutralization\xe2\x88\x92reionization mass spectrometry and MP2/6-311G(2d,p) ab initio calculations. Pyrimidine was protonated with NH4+ and t-C4H9+ exclusively at the nitrogen atoms whose proton affinity (PA) was calculated at 879 kJ mol-1 in excellent agreement with the experimental datum. The C-2 and C-5 positions in 1 had PA = 573 and 645 kJ mol-1, respectively. 2 was protonated with t-C4H9+ at N-1 and/or N-3 and the amine group in a statistical 2:1 ratio, consistent with the calculated PA = 909 and 864 kJ mol-1, respectively. 3 was protonated at N-1, N-3, and the amine group, which had PA = 943, 905, and 835 kJ mol-1, respectively. The C-5 positions in 2 and 3 were less basic, PA = 807 and 781 kJ mol-1, respectively, and were not attacked by the gas-phase acids used. The thermodynamic proton affinities of gaseous 1, 2, and 3 followed the order of their basicities in solution. The substituent electronic effects on the topical proton affinities are discussed. Pyrimidinium radicals derived from the tautomers of ring-protonated 1, 2, and 3 were found by MP2/6-311G(2d,p) and B3LYP/6-311G(2d,p) to be stable in their equilibrium geometries and upon formation by vertical electron transfer. An unusual kinetic stability was found for pyrimidinium radicals derived from N-1- and N-3-protonated 3. "
"The bound water associated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) in the lamellar and inverted hexagonal structures is determined directly. Bound water is considered as that water which is unavailable for solvation of the polar solute sucrose. In the fluid lamellar (L\xce\xb1) state of dioleoyl PtdEtn (at 2 \xc2\xb0C), 7.2 water molecules per phospholipid are bound and unavailable as a solvent for sucrose. In the inverted hexagonal structure (16 \xc2\xb0C and 30 \xc2\xb0C), 5.4 and 5.6 water molecules per phospholipid, respectively, are unavailable for solvation. Similar results are obtained for egg PtdEtn (L\xce\xb1, 15 \xc2\xb0C, 7.5 water per lipid; L\xce\xb1, 28 \xc2\xb0C, 6.9; HII, 40 \xc2\xb0C, 5.1). Weakly binding polar solutes (glycine and acetate) yield comparable trends that support a dehydration at the lamellar to inverted hexagonal phase transition of approximately 2 water molecules per PtdEtn. This is the first direct determination of the changes in hydration that occur in the lamellar to inverted hexagonal transition. "
"Emerging chemical and genetic evidence suggests that separate biochemical solutions have evolved to synthesize the four known classes of \xce\xb2-lactam antibiotics. One of these classes contains clavulanic acid (1) and a family of structurally related but antipodal clavam metabolites 2\xe2\x88\x925, 7, and 8 which lack a carboxylate at C-3, have a different oxidation state, and exhibit stereochemical features at C-2. Previous work has demonstrated the incorporation of ornithine/arginine in the identical regiochemical sense in all of these natural products, and has established the common intermediacy of the monocyclic \xce\xb2-lactam proclavaminic acid (12) as well. In this paper the quite advanced bicyclic intermediate clavaminic acid (14) has been synthesized in doubly 13C-labeled form by preparative incubation of recombinant clavaminate synthase. The intact and equally efficient incorporation of 14 into valclavam (7) and 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)clavam (8), together with 18O2-incorporation experiments, has been interpreted to define clavaminic acid as the final intermediate shared in the biosynthesis of clavulanic acid and the antipodal clavams. A mechanistic rationale of this interrelationship and the late stages of the respective biosyntheses is proposed. "
"The kinetics of proton transfer from the C(2\xce\xb1) position of 2-(1-methoxybenzyl)thiazolium salts was studied for the p-H and p-N(CH3)3+ derivatives as models for the protonation of the enamine/C(2\xce\xb1)-carbanion, a key intermediate in many thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymatic reactions. The reactions were studied by rapid mixing of the salts with sodium hydroxide in a stopped-flow instrument while monitoring the progress of enamine formation and decomposition in the visible region of the spectrum. It was demonstrated that under the conditions of the experiments, the thiazolium ring opens to give a product with a characteristic 1H-NMR spectrum consistent with both cis and trans stereochemistry about the amide bond generated in the ring opening. Analysis of the progress curves for the p-trimethylammonium-substituted compound (1) gave the following rate constants (25 \xc2\xb0C):\xe2\x80\x89 21 M-1 s-1 for deprotonation at C(2\xce\xb1), 300\xe2\x88\x92540 s-1 for reprotonation, and 3.4 M-1 s-1 for thiazolium ring opening. For the unsubstituted compound (2), the respective rate constants were 0.019 M-1 s-1, 1 s-1, and 0.5 M-1 s-1. Through comparisons with results for the C(2\xce\xb1)-deuterated form of 1, the primary hydrogen isotope effect on deprotonation of 1 was found to be 4\xe2\x88\x926. The C(2\xce\xb1)-H pKa values were estimated to be 15.0\xe2\x88\x9215.5 for 1 and 15.7 for 2. When compared with the turnover number for benzoylformate decarboxylase catalysis, the rate constant for reprotonation of the enamine derived from 2 leads to an estimate of 4500 M as a minimum effective molarity for the enzyme. "
"We describe an efficient regiospecific method for cyclization of unprotected peptide segments based on intramolecular transthioesterification of unprotected cysteinyl peptide thioesters under the control of ring\xe2\x88\x92chain tautomeric equilibrium in aqueous buffered solutions at pH ranging from 5 to 7.5. The initial cyclization to form an intramolecular thioester under the ring\xe2\x88\x92chain tautomeric equilibrium is reversible and could be performed in relatively high concentrations without observable oligomerization. This method overcomes the limitation of conventional cyclization methods that require high dilutions. The reaction becomes irreversible by a subsequent, spontaneous proximity-driven S- to N-acyl transfer to the adjacent N\xce\xb1-amine of cysteine to form an end-to-end cyclic peptide. The cyclization is regioselective. No side reactions were observed with side-chain functionalities such as the N\xce\xb5-amine of lysine, thiol of internal cysteine, or imidazole of histidine. Since a free thiol group was introduced to the product after cyclization, these cyclic peptides were exploited as building blocks for synthesizing peptides with unusual architectures such as bicyclic peptides containing end-to-end backbones and disulfide bridges as well as cascade branched peptide dendrimers.

"Solvolysis of 1,3-di-tert-butyl-5-methyl-5-cyclopenta-1,3-dienyl trifluoroacetate (15a) occurs with a strong dependence on solvent ionizing power (m = 0.97), and gives products of substitution, allylic and skeletal rearrangement with substitution, and elimination. These results are characteristic of a process involving an intermediate carbocation, and provide the first measurements of the kinetics of formation of a cyclopentadienyl cation, the prototypical 4\xcf\x80-electron carbocation destabilized by antiaromaticity. The reactivity of 15a in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol at 25 \xc2\xb0C is calculated to be lower than those of analogous fluorenyl and indenyl derivatives by factors of 3 \xc3\x97 104 and 4 \xc3\x97 102, and is exceeded by that calculated for 1,3-dimethyl-3-cyclopentenyl trifluoroacetate by a factor of 1014, showing the large carbocation destabilizing effects of antiaromaticity. "
"Prostaglandins (PGs) such as \xce\x9412-PGJ2 and \xce\x947-PGA1 methyl ester that possess a cross-conjugated dienone unit exhibit unique antitumor and antiviral activities independent of intracellular cAMP levels. These compounds are transported reversibly into cultured cells and accumulate in nuclei via covalent interaction, eliciting growth inhibition. PGA1 methyl ester, a simple cyclopentenone analog, is less potent. The unique cellular behavior of the dienone PGs correlates well with their chemical properties. The PGs react specifically with thiol nucleophiles such as glutathione. Michael addition of thiols to \xce\x947-PGA1 methyl ester, an alkylidenecyclopentenone derivative, occurs facilely at the endocyclic C(11) position rather than at the C(7) position. This process is reversible, and in solution phase, the adducts are in equilibrium with considerable amounts of free PG and thiols. However, the reaction of this PG with Sepharose-bound thiols, regarded to be plausible mimics of protein thiols, is irreversible, and the resulting adducts are dissociated only by alkali treatment. On the other hand, PGA1 methyl ester reacts with soluble or polymer-anchored thiols at lower rates than \xce\x947-PGAl methyl ester, but the resulting thiol adducts are substantially more stable than those of the dienone PGs. This tendency of the PGA1 methyl ester causes its equilibrium to shift to the adduct formation. The reversibility of the Michael reaction of PGs with thiols is consistent with their intracellular behavior and biological activities. Since glutathione adducts of PGs have no antiproliferative activities for cancer cells, the intracellular free PGs are presumed to interact with target molecules to cause cell growth inhibition. The involvement of the ATP-dependent glutathione S-conjugate export pump (GS-X pump) in the efflux of PGs is discussed. Thus, the marked difference in potency of the dienone and enone PGs is explained by considering the combined kinetic and thermodynamic properties and the action of the GS-X pump. "
"The catalytic mechanism of dihydrofolate reductase is evaluated with Poisson\xe2\x88\x92Boltzmann electrostatic and quantum chemical vibrational frequency calculations. The results indicate that an elevated pKa of 6.5 associated with the chemical step is due to the formation of the enol tautomer of the substrate\'s pterin ring. The tautomer is induced to form as a result of substrate binding, in which the substrate desolvates the active site and binds to the carboxylate of Asp 27. Although the binding reaction is favorable, burial of the negative charge on Asp 27 is not. Protonation of Asp 27 occurs, concerted with tautomerization of the substrate, resulting in active site electrical neutrality and activation of the substrate for catalysis. These results require a reinterpretation of previous data from Raman spectroscopy studies in which it was proposed that the reactive atom, the pterin N5, is directly protonated. Quantum chemical vibrational frequency calculations demonstrate that the enol tautomer undergoes a Raman active vibrational perturbation at a frequency similar to that observed experimentally. Furthermore, the calculations indicate that direct protonation of the pterin N5 due to classical electrostatic interactions is quite difficult, with the pKa for this residue being shifted from 2.6 in solution to below zero while bound to the protein. The conclusions of this work are independent of the protein dielectric constant in the range of 4\xe2\x88\x9220. "
"The X-ray crystal structures of two self-complementary DNA duplexes with the sequence d(CGCGAAtMe/OHtMe/OHCGCG) containing four 6\xe2\x80\x98-\xce\xb1-methyl (tMe) or four 6\xe2\x80\x98-\xce\xb1-hydroxy carbocyclic thymidines (tOH), respectively, have been determined. Both structures are isomorphous to the native Dickerson\xe2\x88\x92Drew dodecamer duplex [d(CGCGAATTCGCG)]2. The cyclopentane moieties of the modified carbocyclic thymidine residues lacking the deoxyribose 4\xe2\x80\x98-oxygen adopt either C2\xe2\x80\x98-endo or C1\xe2\x80\x98-exo B-DNA type puckers. The dodecamer duplex incorporating 6\xe2\x80\x98-\xce\xb1-methyl carbocyclic thymidines shows an enlarged minor groove relative to both the unmodified duplex and the one with incorporated 6\xe2\x80\x98-\xce\xb1-hydroxy carbocyclic thymidines. The pairing of oligonucleotides containing single or multiple 6\xe2\x80\x98-\xce\xb1-substituted carbocyclic thymidines with complementary DNA is discussed on the basis of the structural data. "
"A general synthetic route to the set of polyhydroxylated agarofurans that comprise the core structures of esters present in plants of the Celastraceae family has been devised. The pathway is exemplified with total syntheses of (\xc2\xb1)-3,4-dideoxymaytol (3), the nucleus of ever-1 (6), and (\xc2\xb1)-euonyminol (4), the sesquiterpenoid core of several cathedulins including K-19 (5). A focal intermediate 19, prepared by Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder addition of 11 to 12, was identified that permitted stereoselective introduction of an isopropenyl substituent via chelation-controlled, conjugate Grignard addition to give 34. Triflic acid-catalyzed cyclization of 39 afforded the agarofuran skeleton of 3, and subsequent epimerization of the hydroxyl substituent at C1 via a reversible aldol sequence gave 41. Sequential reductions using hydride and catalytic hydrogenation yielded 3 and 4-epi-3,4-dideoxymaytol (51). The route from 19 was extended toward 4 via 56, prepared by directed epoxidation of 34. A trifuoroacetic acid-catalyzed \xe2\x80\x9cepoxide-cascade\xe2\x80\x9d cyclization of 56 furnished 61, which was advanced to \xce\xb3-lactone 63 prior to epimerization at C1. Introduction of the 8\xce\xb2 hydroxyl function of 69 was followed by an \xce\xb1-ketol transposition to give 71 which was reduced and protected as polysilyl ether 80. Osmylation and replacement of protecting groups produced euonyminol octaacetate 78 which underwent methanolysis to (\xc2\xb1)-4. "
"The cyclic voltammetric investigation of a series of \xce\xb1-substituted acetophenones allowed the identification of the concerted and stepwise character of the dissociative electron transfer reaction, and, in the stepwise cases, the determination of the cleavage rate constants and the standard potentials for the formation of the anion radical. Analysis of the data, using thermodynamical parameters derived from experiment and from literature points to three mechanism governing factors, the oxidability of the leaving group, the bond dissociation energy of the bond being broken, and the LUMO energy. The first of these factors appears to be largely predominant in many cases in the control of the concerted vs stepwise dichotomy. The fluoro substituent provides a reverse example where the bond strength overcomes the unfavorable effect of the leaving group oxidability. It is also an exception, in terms of anion radical cleavage reactivity, where the strength of the C\xe2\x88\x92F bond significantly contributes to slow down the cleavage as opposed to the other substituents where solvent reorganization appears as largely predominant. In the concerted cases, the estimated lifetime of the anion radical is clearly larger than the time of a vibration. The concerted character of the reaction thus results from an energetic advantage rather than from the \xe2\x80\x9cnonexistence\xe2\x80\x9d of the anion radical intermediate. "
"The conformation of a novel 1,2,5-trisubstituted hexahydro-3-oxo-1H-1,4-diazepine system (DAP) has been investigated by proton and carbon NMR and refined with computer simulations. Four N1-acetyl-5-(N,N-dimethylamino)carbonyl DAP analogues, differing in the chirality and substituents at C2, have been studied:\xe2\x80\x89 2-benzyl-(2S,5S)-DAP (SS-F), 2-benzyl-(2R,5S)-DAP (RS-F), 2-methyl-(2S,5S)-DAP (SS-A), and 2-methyl-(2R,5S)-DAP (RS-A). The NMR spectra for each of the four analogues showed the presence of two configurational isomers slowly interconverting on the NMR time scale; the site of the cis/trans isomerization was identified as the N1-acetyl peptidic bond. The experimental restraints from NMR data consisted of a limited number of interproton distances and well-determined coupling constants; their utilization in distance geometry and distance and angle driven dynamics calculations produced high-resolution structures for three of the analogues. The C2 chirality (R or S) in the seven-membered ring determines the topological projection of the acetyl group with respect to the plane of the ring. The nature of the C2 substituent has only a small effect on the conformation of the ring and overall orientation of the N1 and C5 substituents. No significant structural differences result from the cis or trans configuration at the N1-acetyl peptidic bond. The results presented here indicate that DAP is a useful dipeptidomimetic with structural characteristics distinct from those of the widely used benzodiazepine. "
"The facial diastereoselectivity in the Patern\xc3\xb2\xe2\x88\x92B\xc3\xbcchi reaction of chiral silyl enol ethers and benzaldehyde was studied. The substituents (RS, RL) at the stereogenic carbon atom (\xe2\x88\x92C*HRSRL) attached to the \xce\xb2-position of the silyl enol ether were varied in order to evaluate the influence of steric bulk and electronic effects. The combined yields for the two diastereomeric 3-(silyloxy)oxetanes a and b range between 44% and 76%. In accordance with the 1,3-allylic strain model the facial diastereoselectivity (diastereomeric ratio (dr) = a/b) was best with large (RL = t-Bu, SiMe2Ph) and polar (RL = OMe) substituents at the \xce\xb3-position of the silyl enol ether (dr up to >95/5). Two regioselective ring opening reactions were applied to the product oxetanes 29a, 50, and 51. They furnished diastereomerically pure diols (52, 53) and triols (31) in excellent yields. "
"The first synthesis of the title compound is described. The synthesis features an acetal-vinylsilane cyclization to stereoselectively form the cis-2,7-disubstituted oxepene ring and introduce \xce\x944 unsaturation. Starting with (2R,3S)-2,3-epoxypentan-1-ol (16), mixed acetal 10 is formed in five steps and 72% overall yield. Treatment of 10 with excess BCl3 in CH2Cl2 at \xe2\x88\x9278 \xe2\x86\x92 0 \xc2\xb0C promotes cyclization to afford \xce\x944-oxepene 39 in 90% yield after deprotection of the silyl ether.

"p-Hydroxyphenacyl, a new photoactive, aqueous soluble protecting group is proposed as a second generation \xce\xb1-keto \xe2\x80\x9ccage\xe2\x80\x9d reagent, a phototrigger for the efficient, rapid release of bioactive phosphates, e.g., inorganic phosphate (Pi) and ATP (Givens, R. S.; Park, C.-H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996, 37, 6259\xe2\x88\x926262). p-Hydroxyphenacyl esters 6c and 7 trigger the release of Pi and ATP when irradiated at wavelengths between 300\xe2\x88\x92350 nm also yielding p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (8) from the rearrangement of the intermediate \xce\xb1-keto carbocation or its equivalent. In contrast, unsubstituted and m-substituted phenacyl esters yield only photoreduction and radical coupling products and none of the rearrangement product. Quantum efficiencies of 0.38 \xc2\xb1 0.04 were measured for the disappearance of the p-hydroxyphenacyl phosphate esters 6c and 7; the appearance efficiencies for 8 and ATP were 0.30 \xc2\xb1 0.03. Rates of release of \xe2\x88\xbc107 s-1 or better are observed for these esters with only minor variations in efficiencies and rate constants between these two examples of the p-hydroxyphenacyl phototrigger. Just as was found for the desyl \xe2\x80\x9ccage\xe2\x80\x9d series reported earlier (Givens, R. S.; Athey, P. S.; Kueper, L. W., III; Matuszewski, B.; Xue, J.-y.; Fister, T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 6001\xe2\x88\x926010), the p-hydroxyphenacyl derivatives react via their triplet states. Amino substituents, i.e., p-amino-, p-acetamido-, and p-(carbomethoxyamino)phenacyl phosphates 6f\xe2\x88\x92h, were also investigated, but these analogues proved to be inferior as phototriggers when compared with p-hydroxyphenacyl.

"Photoexcited [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine) can be quenched with [Co(NH3)5Cl]2+ to give [Ru(bpy)3]3+; this photogenerated oxidant (E0 = 1.25 V vs NHE) reacts with horseradish peroxidase isoenzyme c (HRPc) to produce oxidized protein species. Spectra and kinetics measured by laser-flash transient spectroscopy show that oxidation of the trivalent resting state, [PFeIII]+ (P = porphyrin dianion), to ferryl compound II, [PFeIVO], is preceded by generation of a \xcf\x80-cation porphyrin radical intermediate, [PFeIII]\xe2\x80\xa22+. In the interval 7.8 < pH < 9.8, the rate-limiting step for the transformation of the radical intermediate to compound II is the binding of a water molecule to the five-coordinate heme iron, kobsd = (4.1 \xc2\xb1 0.9) s-1; this step is followed by fast proton and electron transfer to give the ferryl species. There is a burst in compound II formation in the pH region (10.3 < pH < 10.8) in which the heme iron changes from a five-coordinate, high-spin species to a six-coordinate, low-spin complex (pKa = 10.9); this burst is attributed to very rapid conversion of a hydroxo-ligated ferric \xcf\x80-cation radical porphyrin to a ferryl species. The rate constant for the porphyrin-centered oxidation of compound II to compound I ([PFeIVO] to [PFeIVO]\xe2\x80\xa2+; k = 1.1 \xc3\x97 108 M-1 s-1) is slightly larger than that for the oxidation of [PFeIII]+ to [PFeIII]\xe2\x80\xa22+ (k = 2.5 \xc3\x97 107 M-1 s-1) at pH 10.3; both porphyrin-centered oxidations are much faster than the conversion of [PFeIII]+ to [PFeIVO] below pH 9.8.

"A pair of cyanide-bridged iron\xe2\x88\x92copper molecular assemblies relevant to cyanide-inhibited heme\xe2\x88\x92copper oxidases has been studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy at both Fe and Cu K-edges. These two complexes, [(py)(OEP)Fe\xe2\x88\x92CN\xe2\x88\x92Cu(Me6tren)]2+ (2) and [(py)(OEP)Fe\xe2\x88\x92CN\xe2\x88\x92Cu(TIM)]2+ (3), contain a unique four-body Fe\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92N\xe2\x88\x92Cu bridge with an Fe\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92N angle of 179\xc2\xb0. They, however, differ significantly in the Cu\xe2\x88\x92N\xe2\x88\x92C angle (174\xc2\xb0 in 2 and 147\xc2\xb0 in 3). These two complexes provide the opportunity to study long-range multiple scattering (MS) interactions between the Fe and the Cu centers. We have calculated theoretical four-body MS signals for the bridge configuration and other four-body pathways in the structures, and performed least-squares fittings of the theoretical signals to the experimental data using the GNXAS programs. A strong long-range Fe\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Cu interaction (4.94 \xc3\x85) has been observed from both the Fe and Cu K-edge data for 2. GNXAS analysis shows that this long-range interaction is attributed to the MS amplitude enhancement from the linear four-body Fe\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92N\xe2\x88\x92Cu configuration. This interaction is not observable from the Fe and Cu K-edge data for 3 where the angle deviates significantly from linearity. An angle-dependence study of MS effects on the Cu\xe2\x88\x92N\xe2\x88\x92C angle shows that there is a large enhancement of MS intensity when the angle approaches linearity, and that this MS effect is negligible when the angle is below \xe2\x88\xbc160\xc2\xb0. Essentially no Fe\xe2\x88\x92Cu interaction is detectable for a configuration with such an angle. Comparisons with three-body MS effects found in Fe\xe2\x88\x92O/O(H)\xe2\x88\x92Cu bridged systems are made. The significance of the findings of this study to the structural definition of the binuclear center in the cyanide-inhibited heme-copper oxidases is discussed. "
"Two-dimensional protein crystallization on lipid monolayers is becoming a powerful technique for structure determination as well as materials applications. However, progress has been hindered by the requirement of a unique affinity lipid for each new protein of interest. Metal ion coordination by surface-accessible histidine side chains provides a convenient and general method for targeting of proteins to surfaces. Here we present the synthesis and characterization of a metal-chelating lipid which has been designed to target proteins to Langmuir monolayers and promote their two-dimensional crystallization based on histidine coordination. The lipid utilizes the metal chelator iminodiacetate (IDA) as the hydrophilic headgroup and contains unsaturated, oleyl tails to provide the fluidity necessary for two-dimensional protein crystallization. The lipid is shown to bind copper from the subphase strongly when incorporated in Langmuir monolayers. In addition, it is possible to form copper-containing monolayers by spreading the premetalated lipid on the subphase in the absence of copper. Fluorescence microscopy reveals the binding and crystallization of the protein streptavidin, promoted by the simultaneous coordination of two surface-accessible histidine side chains to the IDA\xe2\x88\x92Cu lipid.

"The lability of the mononuclear octahedral complex tris(5-methyl-2-(1\xe2\x80\x98-methylbenzimidazol-2-yl)-pyridine)cobalt(II), [Co(2)3]2+, is compared with the dinuclear triple-helical complex tris[bis[1-methyl-2-(5\xe2\x80\x98-methylpyrid-2\xe2\x80\x98-yl]benzimidazol-5-yl]methane]dicobalt(II), [Co2(1a)3]4+. [Co(2)3]2+ undergoes rapid isomerization between mer and fac forms (k298(mer\xe2\x88\x92fac) = 1.6 \xc2\xb1 0.2 s-1) in acetonitrile while the racemization of (\xe2\x88\x92)589-[Co2(1a)3]4+ is roughly 105 times slower (k298 = 1.4 \xc2\xb1 2 10-5 s-1). The pressure dependence of the isomerization of [Co(2)3]2+ suggests a dissociatively activated process. The racemization of (\xe2\x88\x92)589-[Co2(1a)3]4+ is found to be independent of pH above pH 4, and is not affected by added cobalt(II) or a change of solvent. Ligand exchange between [Co2(1b)3]4+ (1b = bis[1-ethyl-2-(5\xe2\x80\x98-methylpyrid-2\xe2\x80\x98-yl)benzimidazol-5-yl]methane) and free 1a may be followed by electrospray mass spectrocopy and establishes the mechanism of formation of the triple helix to be initial formation of mononuclear [Co(1a)3]2+ followed by capping by a second cobalt to give [Co2(1a)3]4+. The slow racemization of (\xe2\x88\x92)589-[Co2(1a)3]4+ is attributed to the very slow dissociation of a cobalt ion from the triple helix. This inertness is attributed to the rigidity of the ligand and the tight pitch of the helix. "
"The hydrothermal syntheses, X-ray crystal structures, and magnetic properties of a family of 3-D chiral framework cobalt phosphates are presented. Two different types of framework structures are described:\xe2\x80\x89 one has the same topology as the well-known zeolite ABW framework and represents the only pure cobalt phosphate framework with a known zeolite topology; the other exhibits a framework connectivity which can be considered as a hybrid of tridymite and ABW frameworks. These new chiral materials were obtained by systematic chemical variation, accurate control of solution pH values, and use of non-aqueous solvents. Synthesis conditions were found which favored the crystallization of Co2+ oxygen tetrahedra in strict alternation with P5+ oxygen tetrahedra from cobalt phosphate solutions in the presence of Na+, K+, NH4+, or Rb+ ions. The transition from one framework type to the other is affected by the size of these extra-framework cations. The two ABW structures (NH4CoPO4-ABW, RbCoPO4) have eight-ring channels along the monoclinic b axis; the three hybrid hexagonal structures (NaCoPO4, KCoPO4, NH4CoPO4-HEX) have six-ring channels along the hexagonal c-axis. The 3-D framework of the hexagonal structures is built from a unique [2.2.2]propellane-like triple four-ring unit. Both the ABW framework and the hexagonal framework can be viewed as layers of hexagonal rings directly interconnected by oxygen bridges. The enantiomorphic purity and crystal twinning habits of these materials are correlated with the cation type and synthesis conditions. Magnetic susceptibility measurements at temperatures above 10 K are consistent with pure paramagnetic tetrahedral Co2+ displaying the Curie\xe2\x88\x92Weiss behavior. At lower temperatures, a ferromagnetic ordering transition is observed with ordering temperatures at or below 3 K. "
"The compound BaBiTe3 was prepared by the reaction of Ba/Bi/Te at over 700 \xc2\xb0C in either K2Te4 or BaTe3 flux and was recrystallized in a Ba/BaTe3 flux.

Number with Fo2 > 3\xcf\x83(Fo)2 3373, number of variables 92, and sin (\xce\xb8/\xce\xbb) < 0.7. The final R/Rw = 4.55/5.61%. The structure is BaBiSe3 type and may be described as layers made up from interdigitating columnar [Bi4Te10(Te2)]\xe2\x88\x9e \xe2\x80\x9cherring-bone\xe2\x80\x9d shaped segments. Ba2+ ions are in distorted tri-capped trigonal prismatic sites between the layers. From band structure calculations, a formal charge distribution taking into account the occurrence of short-bonding Te\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Te contacts in the structure can be written as Ba2+4Bi3+4Te2-8Te1-4. The electrical conductivity, thermopower, thermal lattice conductivity, and infrared absorption properties of this material suggest that it is a narrow gap semiconductor. These results are discussed in the context of the band scheme. "
"The first comparative kinetic study of the addition of the isolobal and isosteric CO and N2 ligands to a spin triplet organometallic compound, i.e. Cp*MoCl(PMe3)2, is reported. A fast and quantitative addition process occurred when interacting Cp*MoCl(PMe3)2 with CO, which is followed by a subsequent slower process involving PMe3 replacement and formation of Cp*MoCl(CO)2(PMe3). The N2 addition, on the other hand, is much slower and proceeds incompletely to an equilibrium position. The temperature dependence of this equilibrium gives the parameters for the reaction \xce\x94H = \xe2\x88\x9222.8 \xc2\xb1 2.1 kcal/mol and \xce\x94S = \xe2\x88\x9267 \xc2\xb1 7 cal\xc2\xb7mol-1\xc2\xb7K-1. The activation parameters for the CO addition are \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 5.0 \xc2\xb1 0.3 kcal/mol and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9235 \xc2\xb1 4 cal\xc2\xb7mol-1\xc2\xb7K-1, while the activation parameters for the N2 addition are \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 14.0 \xc2\xb1 1.0 kcal/mol and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9220 \xc2\xb1 3 kcal/mol. Extrapolation of the rates to 25 \xc2\xb0C indicates a difference of more than three orders of magnitude:\xe2\x80\x89 kCO = 29 \xc2\xb1 3 M-1 s-1 and kN2 = 0.014 \xc2\xb1 0.001 M-1 s-1. Theoretical calculations with full geometry optimization at the MP2 level have been carried out on the model systems CpMoCl(PH3)2 + L (L = CO or N2), the calculated energetics of the system being in agreement with experiment. The 16-electron CpMoCl(PH3)2 molecule is found to be more stable in the spin triplet state, the excited 1A\xe2\x80\x98 state being 10.9 kcal/mol higher in energy. The Mo\xe2\x88\x92L bond formation is calculated to be exothermic by 27.9 kcal/mol for L = N2 and by 60.0 kcal/mol for L = CO. Calculations along the L addition coordinate show an initial ligand rearrangement related barrier for both the spin singlet and the spin triplet surfaces. After overcoming this barrier, the spin singlet curve descends in energy earlier for the CO vs the N2 addition as expected from greater diffuseness of the CO donor and acceptor orbitals. As the N2 ligand continues to approach the metal, the 3A\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 surface becomes increasingly repulsive whereas the addition of CO leads to an attractive interaction and a bound triplet state.

"Interaction of cis-Ptdppp(p-C6H4CN)2 or cis-Ptdppp(p-C2C6H4N)2 with cis-ML2(OSO2CF3)2 (M = Pt or Pd; L = PEt3 or L2 = dppp), in CH2Cl2 or acetone, at room temperature, results in mixed, neutral-charged cyclic tetranuclear, Pt\xe2\x88\x92Pt or Pt\xe2\x88\x92Pd macrocyclic complexes in 90\xe2\x88\x9299% yields via self-assembly.

"The involvement of ground and excited state proton transfer reactions in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) of bradykinin and bovine insulin is examined using a series of p-substituted aniline compounds as matrices. Semiempirical calculations of ground and excited state acidity of the p-substituted aniline and anilinium ions are presented. A linear correlation between log (analyte [A + H]+ ion yield) and matrix acidity is obtained. The behavior of the seven p-substituted anilines is discussed in terms of the relationship between matrix compound structure, reactivity, and ability to act as a MALDI matrix. "
"Classical molecular dynamics simulation is employed to study the photodissociated B-states of carbon monoxymyoglobin. Four independent 10 ps dynamical trajectories of the fully solvated protein, in a box of 2988 water molecules using periodic boundary conditions, were simulated at 300 K starting from the equilibrium deoxymyoglobin structure. Two prototypical protein conformational substates, defined by the conformation of the distal histidine, were sampled from a 1.5 ns trajectory of solvated, room temperature deoxymyoglobin. The structure and ligand vibrational spectral line shapes and frequency shifts were derived from the simulation trajectories. The simulated structure of the ligand\xe2\x88\x92heme complex shows that the ligand is localized under the C-ring of the heme, which is consistent with the low-temperature X-ray crystal structures of the photolyzed state [Schlichting et al. Nature 1994, 371, 808. Teng; \xc5\xa0rajer; Moffat Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994, 1, 701]. The ligand is found to be parallel to the heme \xe2\x80\x9cplane\xe2\x80\x9d and confined to a small region displaced from the heme iron in apparent agreement with the low-temperature X-ray crystal structures and room temperature experimental studies [Lim; Jackson; Anfinrud Science 1995, 269, 962]. Stark shifts in the ligand vibrational frequency, induced by the protein electric field in the heme pocket, are estimated using both atomic point charge models with explicit solvent and finite difference Poisson\xe2\x88\x92Boltzmann calculations. Simulated ligand frequency shifts are compared with those of the experimental spectrum as a test of the accuracy of the simulated electric field in the heme pocket. The magnitudes of the induced ligand frequency shifts are in good agreement with experimental results. The largest contribution to the electric field in the heme pocket is due to the heme and proximal histidines not, as it has often been assumed, the distal histidine. The exact value of the protein electric field experienced by the ligand is well correlated with the conformation of the distal His. The dipole induced in the ligand by the protein electric field is found to make a significant contribution to the total ligand dipole moment and is not necessarily aligned with the ligand bond. The proposal that the ligand \xe2\x80\x9cdocking site\xe2\x80\x9d functions to suppress CO binding is examined. "
"Substituent and solvent effects on the reaction pathway of the Beckmann rearrangement were studied. Energy surfaces of the isolated gas phase systems were mapped out using ab initio MO calculations at the MPn and QCISD(T) levels with basis sets ranging from 6-31G(d,p) to 6-311++G(2df,2p). In the simplest gas phase system, the most favored path is as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 protonation of formaldehyde oxime \xe2\x86\x92 N-protonated species \xe2\x86\x92 O-protonated species \xe2\x86\x92 fragmentation products, in which the 1,2-H-shift connecting both protonated isomers is rate-determining. While both methyl and formyl substituents on C and O of the oxime have only a small effect on the rate-controlling energy barrier, they significantly modify the barrier to fragmentation. The bulk solvent effect which is treated by a polarizable continuum model does affect only marginally the activation parameters with respect to the gas phase values. A combination of both quantum and statistical mechanics was also used to probe the solvent effect. In order to investigate the active role of the solvent, ab initio calculations were carried out within a supermolecule approach. An active participation of one solvent molecule in a reacting supersystem gives rise to a genuine effect. As simple solvent molecules, H2O, H2CO, and HCOOH were studied, the latter being a model for the Beckmann solution (HCl + acetic acid + acetic anhydride). While their involvement as a coreactant considerably reduces the barrier of the 1,2-H-shift by about 50% and hence approaches the experimental results, the effect of the bulk solvent on the reacting supersystem remains small. The calculated results suggest that the Beckmann rearrangement represents a strong case of active solvent participation, which consists in assisting the rate-determining 1,2-H-shift by catching the migrating hydrogen of the substrate and putting it back at the other end; the migration is thereby considerably accelerated.

"(2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-Octaethyl-5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphinato)iron(III) chloride FeIII(OETPP)Cl and (2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octamethyl-5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphinato)iron(III) chloride FeIII(OMTPP)Cl complexes have been synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR and X-ray crystallography. Both molecules are severely nonplanar and assume saddle shapes in solid state. Variable-temperature 1H NMR studies confirm that the conformational distortions are maintained in solution with \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 15.8 and 10.1 kcal/mol for ring inversion for Fe(OETPP)Cl and Fe(OMTPP)Cl, respectively. EPR (g\xe2\x8a\xa5 = 5.2\xe2\x88\x925.3 at 77 K), magnetic moments (\xce\xbceff = 4.7\xe2\x88\x925.2 \xce\xbcB at 300 K), and structural data (Fe\xe2\x88\x92Np = 2.03 \xc3\x85, Fe\xe2\x88\x92Cl = 2.24\xe2\x88\x922.25 \xc3\x85) all indicate that unlike high-spin FeIII(TPP)Cl and FeIII(OEP)Cl (S = 5/2), FeIII(OETPP)Cl and FeIII(OMTPP)Cl these complexes are of the uncommon quantum-mixed S = 5/2, 3/2 intermediate-spin state. Saddle-shaped ring deformations lower the symmetries of the complexes into C2v. Other than the nonaxial symmetric EPR spectra of both complexes, 1H NMR spectrum of FeIII(OETPP)Cl shows large asymmetry to the methylene proton shifts. Certain cytochromes c\xe2\x80\x98 from photosynthetic bacteria reported to be of similar quantum-mixed intermediate-spin and showed EPR signals of rhombic symmetry have been noted to be with saddle-shaped deformations. These anomalous spin states and electronic structure asymmetry are ascribed to the ring deformation of the porphyrin macrocycle. "
"MM3 calculations on the cholesteryl acetate crystal were carried out to study the accuracy of the MM3 force field, and to evaluate previous approximations (Kuchitsu and Cyvin) in the relationships among rg, rz, and r\xce\xb1 bond lengths. It has been found that the previous approximations are good for treating the skeletons of relatively rigid molecules, for chemical bonds not involving hydrogen atoms. However, additional corrections have to be included to interconvert rg, rz, and r\xce\xb1 bond lengths for general purposes. New relationships among rg, rz, and r\xce\xb1 bond lengths have been derived. Using the improved approximations, our MM3 r\xce\xb1 structure for cholesteryl acetate in the crystal agrees well with experimental results (neutron diffraction, 20 K), including for the bonds involving hydrogen atoms.

Allenylsilanes undergo enantioselective intramolecular photocycloaddition reactions with enones and enoates to give adducts in 76\xe2\x88\x9299% enantiomeric excess and 67\xe2\x88\x9290% yield. The silyl-substituted exo-methylenecyclobutane products undergo protodesilylation to give the parent unsubstituted exo-methylenecyclobutane. Optically active allenylsilanes may thus be used in enantioselective photocycloadditions in which the silyl moiety functions as a removable stereochemical controlling group. 
The effects of different amounts of four natural polyamines on the thermodynamics of the thermal denaturation of calf thymus and herring sperm DNA have been studied by means of differential scanning calorimetry. Enthalpy changes and the temperature of the maximum heat effect were determined. The stability of the double helix increases by increasing the polyamine/phosphate ratio and the number of positively charged groups on the polyamine molecule. A combination of Manning\'s polyelectrolyte theory and McGhee and von Hippel\'s multiple-site exclusion approach has been demonstrated to give a very good reproducibility of experimental results. 
"Examination of the pseudorotaxane-like geometries adopted in the solid state by a series of 1:1 complexes revealed significant differences in the hydrogen bonding interactions between oxygen atoms in some hydroquinone-based guests carrying polyether/polyester functions and the acidic hydrogen atoms on the bipyridinium units of the hostcyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene). These differences are reflected directly in the stabilities of the complexes in solution and dramatic changes in the magnitudes of their association constants (Ka values ranging from 130 to 4300 M-1 in MeCN at 25 \xc2\xb0C) are observed upon varying the location of the carbonyl ester function(s) along the polyether/ester chains. A similar effect (Ka values ranging from 5 to 730 M-1 in Me2CO at 25 \xc2\xb0C) was observed in the binding of paraquat as its bipyridinium bis(hexafluorophosphate) salt by analogous macrocyclic hydroquinone-based mono- and bis-lactones. Investigations of the kinetics of hydrolyses of the ester functions revealed thatwhile inert in their free formsthe macrocyclic mono- and bis-lactones undergo hydrolysis when incorporated within [2]catenanes composed of one of these macrocyclic lactones and cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene). Presumably, the enhanced reactivity of the ester functions is a result of [C\xe2\x88\x92H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O] hydrogen bonding interactions involving the ester carbonyl oxygen atoms and the acidic hydrogen atoms on the bipyridinium units, as suggested by single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analyses.

"1-(tert-Butylperoxy)-3,3-dimethyl-1H-1,2-benziodoxoles (2a and 2b) and 1-(tert-butylperoxy)-3,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)-5-methyl-1H-1,2-benziodoxole (2c) were prepared from chloroiodanes 1a\xe2\x88\x92c and tert-butyl hydroperoxide in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran. Products, kinetic data for the decomposition of 2 in cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and acetonitrile (Ea = 31.0 \xc2\xb1 1.0 kcal/mol, log A = 17.0 \xc2\xb1 0.5; 35\xe2\x88\x9270 \xc2\xb0C), and the increased rate of decomposition of 2c in benzene-d6 in the presence of a magnetic field (7 T) indicate that homolytic cleavage of the I\xe2\x88\x92O bond in 2 with the formation of iodanyl (9-I-2) and tert-butylperoxyl radicals is the primary decomposition step. The nearly quantitative formation of iodocyclohexane during the decomposition of 2c in cyclohexane is due to the unexpected reaction of cyclohexyl radicals with 2-(2-iodo-5-methylphenyl)-1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, a primary decomposition product of 2c. The results of a separate study of the deiodination of o-iodocumyl alcohols (3) by cyclohexyl radicals are consistent with an SH2 type mechanism. "
"The preparation and purification of the heterocyclic diradical benzo-1,2:4,5-bis(1,3,2-dithiazolyl) (BBDTA) is described. Crystals of BBDTA, grown by fractional sublimation at 120\xe2\x88\x92180 \xc2\xb0C/10-3 Torr, are monoclinic, space group P21/c, with a = 4.144(2), b = 9.0344(13), and c = 10.7424(16) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 91.11(3)\xc2\xb0, and Z = 2. The crystal structure consists of discrete, unassociated molecules of BBDTA. The molecules form slipped stacks along the x direction, with the mean molecular plane making an angle of 32.4\xc2\xb0 to the x axis. The interplanar separation between consecutive molecules along the stacking direction is 3.49 \xc3\x85. The ESR spectrum of BBDTA is solvent dependent, displaying signals attributable to partially associated materials (not exchange coupled) and to free diradical (exchange coupled). Ab initio molecular orbital calculations suggest a small (ca. 0.5 kcal/mol) separation between the triplet and singlet diradical states. Cyclic voltammetry on BBDTA and the related benzo-1,3,2-dithiazolyl BDTA, coupled with gas phase photoelectron studies on BDTA, establish that both compounds are strong electron donors. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show that BBDTA is essentially diamagnetic up to room temperature; variable temperature single-crystal conductivity measurements provide a band gap of 0.22 eV. The transport properties are discussed in the light of extended H\xc3\xbcckel band structure calculations, which suggest a highly three-dimensional electronic structure for bulk BBDTA in the solid state.

"Hydrogen peroxide and a trace of either ethene or propene initiated the conversion of ethane to propionic acid and its mixed anhydride (CH3CH2CO2H + CH3CH2COOCOCF3) and trifluoromethyl ethyl ketone, CH3CH2COCF3, by trifluoroacetic anhydride at 80 \xc2\xb0C. For a fixed amount of H2O2, the amount of products formed increased with increasing amount of trifluoroacetic anhydride employed and was always higher than the amount of H2O2 added. These products were also obtained when H2O2 was replaced by other radical initiators:\xe2\x80\x89 m-chloroperbenzoic acid, azobisisobutyronitrile, and PbEt4. With PbEt4, ethene or propene was not required for product formation and close to 500 equiv of products was formed for every equivalent of PbEt4 employed! Longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acid anhydrides reacted analogously; however, as the Rf group increased in length, a corresponding increase in mixed anhydride to ketone selectivity was observed. Methane gave very little product under the reaction conditions whereas propane underwent simple stoichiometric oxidation to 2-propanol and acetone by H2O2. The addition of (CF3CO2)2Pd to the ethane reaction resulted in simple oxidation to ethanol and acetaldehyde in amounts lower than that corresponding to the H2O2 present. In complete contrast to the ethane reaction, the yield of products from methane increased significantly (although less than the H2O2 added) upon the addition of (CF3CO2)2Pd, with methanol being the principal product.

The first diffuse reflectance UV-vis-NIR spectra of metal carbonyl clusters have been obtained; spectra of [Ru2(\xce\xbc-H)(\xce\xbc-NC5H4)2(CO)4(NC5H5)2][Ru10(\xce\xbc-H)(\xce\xbc6-C)(CO)23(PPh3)] and [ppn]2[Ru10(\xce\xbc6-C)(CO)24] contain broad absorptions extending to a \xce\xbbonset of 1300 nm with absorption maxima corresponding to those of the solution spectra superimposed. Local density functional (LDF) calculations support the optical spectra assignments and predict a triply degenerate HOMO approximately 1.3 eV below the LUMO. Magnetic susceptibility data for [Ru2(\xce\xbc-H)(\xce\xbc-NC5H4)2(CO)4(NC5H5)2][Ru10(\xce\xbc-H)(\xce\xbc6-C)(CO)23(PPh3)] show a temperature independent susceptibility \xcf\x87m of +1384 \xc2\xb1 10 \xc3\x97 10-6 cm3 mol-1 (diamagnetic correction including decaruthenium valence electrons), arising from Van Vleck paramagnetism; unlike related decaosmium clusters and lower nuclearity ruthenium clusters, no temperature dependent component of the susceptibility exists. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) investigations on three decaruthenium cluster anions reveal a temperature-independent paramagnetic (TIP) signal which does not derive from solid-state packing effects, the nature of the cation, the presence of impurities such as colloids, particles, or oxides, or incipient metallic character (\xe2\x80\x9cmesometallic\xe2\x80\x9d behavior); this EPR signal, the first reported TIP resonance from a carbonyl cluster, is assigned to the presence of radical decaruthenium clusters due to oxidation of the cluster anions.

"This work describes a new method for the preparation of metal-containing catenanes and rotaxanes, using pure coordination chemistry, by stepwise reaction of organic fragments with two different transition metals. The key organic compound contains two terpyridine (terpy) ligands and one diphenylphenanthroline (dpp) moiety and was prepared in high yield by alkylation of 2,9-bis(hydroxyphenyl)-1,10-phenanthroline with 5-(3-methanosulfonyl-1-propyl)-5\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-methyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98:6\xe2\x80\x98,2\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-terpyridine. Reaction of this polyfunctional ligand with 1 equiv of a dpp-containing 30-membered macrocycle and Cu(I) as a template led to a threaded Cu(dpp)2+-type precursor complex (P). Due to the high affinity of Cu(I) for the dpp ligands, the reaction is selective, and no competition of the terpy units for the metal takes place. Thus, this threaded complex contains two free terpy moieties suitable for a further coordination reaction. Ru(II) was used to build the stoppers or to clip the free ligands due to the high stability of Ru(terpy)22+ complexes. Compound P reacts with Ru(DMSO)4Cl2 in 1,2-dichloroethane\xe2\x88\x92EtOH at 70 \xc2\xb0C under high dilution conditions to give the desired catenate in 43% yield. A Cu coordinated rotaxane was obtained by stoppering the free ends of precursor P with 2 equiv of Ru(terpy)(acetone)3(BF4)2. In both cases the intertwined geometry of the dpp units is maintained after Ru(II) coordination. The complexes were characterized by spectroscopic methods, FAB-MS, and cyclic voltammetry. The high stability of the Ru complexes allows for the selective removal of Cu(I). Thus, reaction of the Cu-complexed rotaxane or the catenate with KCN in MeCN\xe2\x88\x92H2O led to the corresponding rotaxane or catenane, respectively, in which the intertwined topography has been destroyed upon liberation of the dpp ligands. This approach opens a new way for the preparation of multicomponent species with promising photochemical properties. "
"A new metastable binary compound and a series of new, metastable ternary crystalline compounds with the skutterudite crystal structure have been prepared through controlled crystallization of amorphous reaction intermediates formed by low-temperature interdiffusion of modulated elemental reactants. Discussed in this paper are La1-xFe4Sb12, FeSb3, Hf1-xFe4Sb12, and Y1-xFe4Sb12. The amorphous reaction intermediate for each system crystallizes exothermically near 200 \xc2\xb0C forming the desired skutterudite structure. At temperatures above 500 \xc2\xb0C, they decompose exothermically forming a thermodynamically more stable mixture of binary compounds and elemental components. We propose that the desired compounds nucleate from the amorphous precursor because slow solid state diffusion rates hinder disproportionation into the more stable mix of binary compounds and elements. This general synthetic approach to prepare new metastable compounds gives control of both the composition and structure of the product compounds. "
"The geometries of two known metastable states of sodium nitroprusside dihydrate, Na2[Fe(CN)5NO]\xc2\xb72H2O, and that of the ground state have been analyzed by X-ray diffraction at 50 K, a temperature at which no decay of metastable-state concentration with time is observed. Data were collected on two laser-excited crystals containing populations of \xe2\x88\xbc37% of metastable state I (MS1) and \xe2\x88\xbc10% of metastable state II (MS2), respectively, using imaging plates and a rotating anode source. For MS1 the apparent geometry changes upon excitation, determined earlier at 138 K (Pressprich, M. R.; White, M. A.; Vekhter, Y.; Coppens, P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994, 116, 5233\xe2\x88\x925238), are confirmed. However, reinterpretation of the diffraction data points to a linear, oxygen-bound isonitrosyl geometry of this species with Fe\xe2\x88\x92O and N\xe2\x88\x92O distances of 1.715(5) and 1.140(7) \xc3\x85, respectively. The diffraction evidence points to a geometry for the MS2 species in which NO is sideways bound (\xce\xb72), with Fe\xe2\x88\x92N, Fe\xe2\x88\x92O, and N\xe2\x88\x92O distances of 1.89(2), 2.07(2), and 1.14(2) \xc3\x85, respectively, compared with 1.6656(7) and 1.133(1) \xc3\x85 for Fe\xe2\x88\x92N and N\xe2\x88\x92O in the ground state. The three geometries correspond to minima in the nondissociative end-over-end linkage isomerization pathway of a diatomic molecule proposed by Armour and Taube for N2 (Armor, J. N.; Taube, H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970, 92, 2560\xe2\x88\x922561). "
"A pseudorotaxane formed in solution by self-assembly of a wire-type electron acceptor (2,7-dibenzyldiazapyrenium dication) and a macrocyclic electron donor (2,3-dinaphtho-30-crown-10) can be unthreaded and rethreaded by chemical inputs. Unthreading can be obtained by addition of stoichiometric amounts of acids or amines. After the unthreading process caused by addition of acid, rethreading can be obtained by addition of amine, and vice versa. The threading/unthreading processes are accompanied (and therefore can be monitored) by strong changes in the fluorescence properties of the system. The input (chemical)/output (fluorescence) characteristics of this molecular-level system correspond to those of an XOR logic gate. "
"Gold nanoparticles, ca. 30 \xc3\x85 in diameter, have been derivatized with specifically deuterated (position 1 and positions 10 to 13) and perdeuterated (positions 2 to 18) octadecanethiols (C18SH). The phase behavior of the octadecanethiolate monolayers chemisorbed onto the colloidal gold surface was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC thermograms show that the C18SH-derivatized Au nanoparticles undergo distinct phase transitions which can be associated with the reversible disordering of the alkyl chains. Despite the highly curved geometry of these Au particles, there is a remarkable degree of conformational order in the alkanethiolate chains and the thermotropic behavior of the thiol-modified gold nanoparticles is very similar to that of conventional, planar self-assembled monolayers. Both the peak maximum temperature and the enthalpy associated with the DSC transition strongly parallel those of the gel-to-liquid crystalline transition of n-diacylphosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer membranes of equivalent chain length. Restricted chain mobility due to covalent bonding of the sulfur head group to the gold surface does not affect the cooperativity of the transition in terms of the transition temperature and enthalpy. Local chain ordering and dynamics in the deuterated C18S/Au nanoparticles have been probed using variable-temperature solid-state deuterium NMR spectroscopy and transmission FT-IR spectroscopy. The temperature dependence of the symmetric CD2 stretching frequency has confirmed that the DSC-detected phase transition involves a thermally-induced change from a predominantly all-trans conformation to a chain disordered state. A comparison of the thermal behavior of d35-C18S/Au and 10,10,11,11,12,12,13,13-d8-C18S/Au shows that disordering originates in the chain terminus region and propagates toward the middle of the chain as the temperature increases. Studies of 1,1-d2-C18S/Au show that the disorder does not extend to the tethered sulfur head group. Deuterium NMR spectroscopy specifically establishes that chain melting arises from an increased frequency of gauche bonds in the alkanethiolate chains. The 2H NMR line shapes further indicate that the tethered alkanethiolate chains are undergoing rapid trans-gauche bond isomerization and axial chain rotation. "
"Evaporation of metals, like W, Mo, V, and In, in the presence of water vapor and subsequent sulfidization has yielded bulk quantities of nested fullerenes, nanotubes, and structures with negative curvature (inorganic fullerene-likeIF). Dissolving alkali-metal salts into the water source afforded alkali-metal intercalation and staging (n = 6) of the IF structures after sulfidization. The intercalated moieties were found to be stable in air and even in water. The intercalated IF structures could be dispersed in alcoholic suspensions, and electrophoretic deposition from the suspensions yielded thin films of the IF particles. The films of intercalated IF showed respectable and time-invariant photoeffects. Furthermore, low adhesion and robust tips for scanning probe microscopy were prepared by depositing intercalated IF film on Si tips. Other applications, which are currently investigated, are briefly mentioned. "
"Ab initio molecular orbital theory at the G2(MP2,SVP) level has been used to study several conformations, defining part of the pseudorotational itinerary, of equatorial 2-oxanol. Half-chair (3H4) and boat (B1,4) transition states lie 23.7 and 14.3 kJ mol-1 above the chair conformation (1C4), respectively, while the twist-boat conformers (3S1 and 5S1) lie 6.9 and 5.9 kJ mol-1 above the chair, respectively. Protonation of the glycosidic oxygen of the chair conformer yields an oxonium ion in the chair conformation. All other conformations collapse to give an oxocarbonium ion\xe2\x88\x92water complex upon protonation. The axial anomer in the chair conformation lies 12.0 kJ mol-1 lower than the equatorial anomer. Protonation of the axial anomer in the chair conformation does not yield a chair, but collapses to the oxocarbonium ion. A clear role is shown for ring distortion in enzymes which perform acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of equatorial glycosides. In addition to avoiding high-energy oxonium ion intermediates, distortion of the ring also reduces the glycosidic bond-stretch energy which delays the transition state and reduces the reaction barrier. Enzymes which hydrolyze the axial anomer do not require ring distortion to achieve a concerted pathway to the oxocarbonium ion. These results are discussed in relation to three enzymes, lysozyme, neuraminidase, and \xce\xb2-amylase. "
"We present the first complete treatment for calculating theoretical estimates of free energies of formation of macromolecule\xe2\x88\x92ligand complexes with molecular dynamics simulations, as the free energy for transforming the ligand into a non-interacting state by gradually diminishing the forces between macromolecule (plus solvent) and ligand. The calculations become possible due to the introduction of a specially designed potential (\xe2\x80\x9cmolecular tweezers\xe2\x80\x9d) which restrains the spatial position and orientation of the ligand molecule and is gradually applied as the transformation proceeds from complexed to non-interacting components. The binding of benzene to a mutant T4 lysozyme (Morton et al. Biochemistry 1995, 34, 8564\xe2\x88\x928575) has been used as a test case. The simulations reproduce the value of the free energy of binding (\xe2\x88\x925.19 kcal/mol if the standard state of benzene is a 1 M aqueous solution) within the sum of experimental and statistical error. Another series of such simulations with rigid protein models provides an estimate of the dependence of the free energy of binding on the protein conformation. The free energy of binding is found to decrease in the series:\xe2\x80\x89 energy-minimized ligand-free protein (\xe2\x88\x923.5 kcal/mol), energy-minimized ligand-containing protein (\xe2\x88\x926.3 kcal/mol), and crystal structure (\xe2\x88\x928.5 kcal/mol). The free energy of binding to a series of snapshots from a protein\xe2\x88\x92ligand dynamics trajectory varies between \xe2\x88\x927 and \xe2\x88\x929 kcal/mol. The \xe2\x80\x9ccratic\xe2\x80\x9d free energy contribution, which corresponds to the loss of translational and rotational freedom of the ligand molecule, was estimated at 7 kcal/mol. It has proved possible to decompose this into translational and rotational components and, from these free energies, estimate the remaining freedom of the benzene in the binding pocket, at 0.6 \xc3\x85 for positional range and 10\xe2\x88\x9215\xc2\xb0 for angular range, in excellent agreement with the motion observed in a dynamics trajectory.

"Photoacoustic calorimetry and steady-state spectroscopic techniques are used to investigate the wavelength-dependent photoreactivity of trans-urocanic acid under representative physiological conditions in vitro. The maxima of the emission and excitation spectra and the value of \xce\x94rH, the reaction enthalpy as determined from photoacoustic measurements, varied as a function of the excitation wavelength. From these data, we are able to confirm that the photolysis of trans-UA at 266 nm (the peak of the absorption spectrum where isomerization is inefficient) generates a long-lived electronically excited triplet state that lies approximately 230 kJ/mol above the ground state. Isomerization does not occur from this triplet electronic state, but bimolecular energy transfer to O2, generating 1\xce\x94g (O2), does occur. Excitation of trans-UA at 308 nm (in the tail of the absorption spectrum) does not lead to triplet state formation. Instead, excitation at this wavelength leads to isomerization. Using measured isomerization quantum yields at this photolysis wavelength (\xce\xa6 = 0.49), we are able to determine that the ground state of cis-UA lies about 40 kJ/mol above that of the trans isomer. Photoacoustic data recorded following the photolysis of cis-UA at 266 and 308 nm show the same trends, supporting the conclusion that the wavelength-dependent chemistry is not due to the presence of multiple ground-state rotamers. The data indicate that the broad structureless absorption spectrum of trans-UA is comprised of overlapping transitions due to at least two distinct electronic states. The different reactivities of these two states result in the wavelength-dependent isomerization yields that have been measured for trans-UA in the UV-B (280\xe2\x88\x92320 nm) range. "
"Rate and equilibrium constants for hydride transfer from a series of 1,3-dimethyl-2-substituted phenylbenzimidazolines to a pyridinium ion, a quinolinium ion, and a phenanthridinium ion have been evaluated. Each oxidizing agent gives a linear Br\xc3\xb8nsted plot with slope, \xce\xb1. The \xce\xb1 values vary systematically with the spontaniety of the reactions. They are in reasonable agreement with the predictions of modified Marcus theory. Their trend is very accurately predicted, showing a parallel (Leffler\xe2\x88\x92Hammond) effect. These results make a multistep mechanism, involving high energy intermediates, very unlikely. "
"Dispersions of monodisperse macroionic spherical particles self assemble into bcc or fcc crystalline colloidal arrays (CCA), which efficiently Bragg diffract light in the near-IR, visible, and UV spectral regions, depending on the lattice constant and the crystal structure. We report here the observation of an anomalously intense \xe2\x80\x9csecondary diffraction\xe2\x80\x9d, which occurs at half the wavelength (\xce\xbbB/2) of light diffracted by the lattice planes with highest particle density (the bcc (110) or the fcc (111) planes). This diffraction is >10-fold more intense than the primary diffraction at \xce\xbbB, and is narrow for light incident normal to the bcc (110) or the fcc (111) planes. This secondary diffraction results from fortuitously superimposed diffraction from numerous lattice planes oriented such that they diffract ca. \xce\xbbB/2 light. We quantitatively modeled the primary and secondary diffraction by using dynamical diffraction theory. This efficient diffraction phenomenon should be useful for optical device fabrication. "
"The mononucleoside, 5\xe2\x80\x98-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-O-isopropylidene isoguanosine (isoG) 2, has a strong affinity for alkali metal cations. Previously, it was shown that isoG 2 self-assembles via hydrogen bonds to give a stable tetramer, (isoG)4 4, in organic solvents (Davis et al. J. Org. Chem. 1995, 60, 4167\xe2\x88\x924176). The isoG tetramer 4 can then coordinate metal cations. In this present study, vapor phase osmometry and further 1H NMR experiments confirmed that isoG 2 self-assembles via complementary hydrogen bonds to form tetramer 4. Molecular models obtained from molecular dynamics and MM2 energy minimization indicate that the isoG tetramer 4 is bowl-shaped, with four C2 oxygens located on the tetramer\'s convex surface. It is likely that these four oxygens on the tetramer\'s convex face coordinate cations. Potassium picrate was used to determine the stoichiometry of the isoG-K+ complex and its K+ binding affinity. Both 1H NMR and UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectroscopic analysis demonstrated that isoG 2 forms an octamer, (isoG)8-K+ (5), in the presence of potassium picrate in CDCl3 and CD3CN. The octamer (isoG)8-K+ (5) has a single set of 1H NMR resonances, even at \xe2\x88\x9290 \xc2\xb0C, consistent with a D4-symmetric head-to-head stacking of two tetramers around the central K+ cation. Analysis of the picrate\'s optical spectra indicated that the picrate salt of (isoG)8-K+ (5) is a separated ion pair in CDCl3, consistent with the K+ being sandwiched between two isoG tetramers. Picrate extraction experiments revealed that (isoG)8 5 is an impressive ionophore, with a K+ association constant (log Ka = 8.2 M-1) approaching that of 18-crown-6 ether derivatives. Indeed, NMR competition experiments for K+ binding between dicyclohexano-18-crown-6 and isoG 2 confirm that the K+ binding constants in CDCl3 for the crown ether and for the self-assembled ionophore are of the same magnitude (Ka = 108 M-1).

"Syntheses and crystal structures of 1,3-bis[(pyrid-2-ylamino)carbonyl]adamantane (1) and its perchlorate salt, copper(II) complex, and 1:1 complexes with a large variety of simple and functionalized 1,\xcf\x89-alkanedicarboxylic acids, HOOC\xe2\x88\x92X\xe2\x88\x92COOH [X = (CH2)n, n = 2, 3, 5, and 8; \xe2\x88\x92CH2\xe2\x88\x92CO (\xce\xb1-ketoglutaric acid); CHCH (maleic acid)] are described. The molecule 1 exhibits remarkable adaptability with respect to the conformation of its two hydrogen-bonding subunits to suit the requirements of the assembling partners so as to generate persistently one-dimensional motifs, for example, infinite zig-zag ribbons with perchlorate ions and chains with both Cu(II) ions and dicarboxylic acids.

"Ribonucleotide reductases are enzymes that catalyze the conversion of ribonucleotides to 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyribonucleotides. This important reaction is initiated by the generation of a C-3\xe2\x80\x98 nucleotide radical and subsequent loss of the 2\xe2\x80\x98-hydroxyl group. In order to model certain steps in this mechanism, selenol ester 23 was prepared and photolyzed providing the first selective chemical access to the 3\xe2\x80\x98-adenosyl radical. From product analysis it could be shown that elimination of the 2\xe2\x80\x98-OH function readily takes place under general base catalysis. The rate coefficient for this reaction was determined by competition kinetics to be 1.5\xc2\xb7106 s-1 in the presence of 1 M triethylammonium acetate buffer at pH 7. Without catalyst the elimination rate is about 103 times slower. It can be concluded that a similar mechanism is also feasible for the key steps of the enzyme catalyzed reaction. "
"Precursors for the selective generation of C-2 glyceryl radicals were synthesized, and the chemical behavior of the corresponding radicals was investigated by ESR spectroscopy, product analysis, and kinetic measurements. It was found that cleavage of the \xce\xb2-C,O bond proceeds rapidly, if a hydroxyl group is present at the radical carbon center. The rate constant for the elimination of a \xce\xb2-acetoxy group from radical 30 was dependent on the solvent (kE = 4 \xc3\x97 105 s-1 in methanol, kE = 2 \xc3\x97 107 s-1 in toluene). With these results and ab initio calculations a concerted elimination mechanism is suggested. \xce\xb1-Methoxy-substituted C-2 glyceryl radicals 42 and 43 showed heterolytic \xce\xb2-C,O bond cleavage under formation of radical cations. With ester-substituted radicals 24 and 35 no elimination could be observed. To demonstrate the biological significance of these findings, C-2 lysolecithin radical 53 was generated, which led to fast \xce\xb2-elimination. "
"The 48-electron cluster Cp*IrCp2Co2(CO)3 has two known isomers, one with a terminal carbonyl ligand and two edge-bridging carbonyls (1) and the other with three edge-bridging carbonyls (2). The rate of their interconversion is dramatically dependent on the number of electrons in the cluster. NMR studies establish that 2 is the thermodynamically favored isomer and that the isomerization is slow at ambient temperatures in the 48 e- complex (kisom \xe2\x89\x88 10-6 s-1 at 298 K). In contrast, isomerization proceeds very rapidly (kisom = 400 s-1) through the 47-electron monocation as part of an efficient electron-transfer-catalyzed process. Cyclic voltammetry and square-wave voltammetry were used to measure the isomerization rate of the monocation. The catalytic nature of the anodically-induced isomerization was diagnosed by theoretical modeling of the electrode responses and by infrared spectroelectrochemistry using a fiber-optic probe of an electrolysis solution. Reductions of the cluster isomers give 49-electron monoanions. The anion 1- isomerizes over the period of a bulk electrolysis to 2-, setting the limits of kisom between 10-1 and 10-3 s-1 for 1-. The relative rate of the cluster isomerization increases, therefore, in the order 48 e- \xe2\x89\xaa 49 e- \xe2\x89\xaa 47 e-, with relative rates of 1:\xe2\x89\x88104:108. Rate enhancements are rationalized in terms of changes in occupancies involving redox orbitals either bonding or antibonding with respect to the trimetallic framework. The results constitute a rare example of the determination of a reaction rate through three oxidation states of a complex. "

Self-assembled supramolecular structures in water strongly depend on whether n is even or odd, which respectively give rise to fibrous assemblies or planar platelets as well as amorphous solids. In connection with this even\xe2\x88\x92odd effect of the hydrocarbon links, internal molecular arrangements of the solid fibers were investigated using FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and crystal analyses, and transmission electron microscopy. The oligomethylene groups of the Glc-NC(12)CN-Glc pack in a monoclinic or an orthorhombic mode in the fiber.

"The lithium salts of [bis(diisopropylamino)thioxophosphoranyl]diazomethane (2) and [(diisopropylamino)(dicyclohexylamino)thioxophosphoranyl]diazomethane (5) react with the (diisopropylamino)(dicyclohexylamino)chlorophosphine (3) and bis(diisopropylamino)chlorophosphine (6), leading to the nitrilimines 4 (63% yield) and 7 (69% yield), respectively. The lithium salt of 2 also reacts with the bis(dicyclohexylamino)phosphenium ion, affording nitrilimine 9 in 51% yield. Using the presence of a chiral substituent either at the carbon or at the nitrogen terminus of the CNN skeleton, variable-temperature solution NMR studies of nitrilimines 4 and 7 demonstrate that they possess a bent allenic structure. The free energy of activation for racemization is ca. 30 kJ mol-1. Ab initio/DFT studies performed on nitrilimine with C-P(S)H2 and N-PH2 substituents 10 show that the most likely pathway for the racemization process is inversion at the carbon atom, followed by rotation of the PSR2 fragment. Bis(trityl)nitrilimine 17 reacts with (R)-\xce\xb1-(acryloxy)-\xce\xb2,\xce\xb2-dimethyl-\xce\xb3-butyrolactone, leading to diastereomeric pyrazolines 18a,b (3/1 ratio) in 60% total yield; this is the first example of a diastereoselective [3 + 2]-cycloaddition reaction involving a nitrilimine.

"Upon ionization in argon matrices by X-irradiation, o-vinylbenzaldehyde (VBA) partially undergoes transfer of the formyl hydrogen atom to the vinylic CH2 group, thereby forming a quinoketene radical cation of the type previously described (Bally, T.; Michalak, J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. A:\xe2\x80\x89 Chem. 1992, 69, 185). This process does not manifest itself clearly in the optical spectra because the transitions of the quinoketene cation coincide with the much more intense ones of VBA\xe2\x80\xa2+ and are mostly obscured by those. However, the IR spectra show unambiguously that the rearrangement occurs rather efficiently. Also they show that in the course of the X-irradiation, the tautomerized cations are reneutralized to from the quinoketene tautomer of VBA in good yield. The quinoketene and its radical cation were independently obtained from 2-methylbenzocyclobutenone which undergoes spontaneous ring-opening on photolysis and/or ionization. The optical spectra of the radical cations are assigned on the basis of CASPT2 calculations and the different species involved in this study are characterized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. "
"Photolyses of 2,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)-substituted methylenecyclobutenones 22\xe2\x88\x9226 give essentially quantitative conversion to the allenylketenes 28\xe2\x88\x9232 which have been isolated as long-lived species at room temperature. As predicted by molecular orbital calculations, the methylenecyclobutenones 22 and 26, with carbethoxy and hydrogen substitution on the methylene group, respectively, undergo thermal equilibration with the corresponding allenylketenes 28 and 32 with equilibrium constants [22]/[28] = 1.0 and [26]/[32] = 0.029, at 100 \xc2\xb0C. The X-ray structure of the phenyl-substituted allenylketene 29 confirms the anti-planar conformation as predicted by calculation. The bis(allenylketene) 35 has been made by an analogous procedure. Hydration rates of the allenylketenes show acceleration by the CO2Et substituent, but in all cases these are modestly less reactive than the 1,2-bisketene (Me3SiCCO)2. "
"Solution equilibria and optical spectra of several metallooctaethylporphyrin \xcf\x80-cation radicals have been examined in methylene chloride solution. The several \xcf\x80-cation radical species, [M(OEP\xe2\x80\xa2)]Y (M = Cu, Ni, Zn, Pd, or VO; Y = ClO4- or SbCl6-), are found to dimerize to form [M(OEP\xe2\x80\xa2)]22+. These dimeric species are characterized by the appearance of a new, strongly concentration-dependent near-infrared absorption band. This band is found in the region of 900\xe2\x88\x92960 nm for all compounds except for the vanadyl complex which absorbs farther to the red at 1375 nm. The equilibrium constants for the dimerization reaction (2[M(OEP\xe2\x80\xa2)]+ (KD) [M(OEP\xe2\x80\xa2)]22+) have been evaluated from multiple-wavelength, concentration-dependent absorption data. Equimolar solutions of these \xcf\x80-cation radicals and their analogous neutral M(OEP) derivatives react to form new binuclear species, [M(OEP\xe2\x80\xa2/2)]2+, in which the single radical electron is delocalized over both porphyrin rings. These new species, for which we suggest the term \xe2\x80\x9cmixed-valence\xe2\x80\x9d \xcf\x80-cation radical and which bear a formal relationship to the oxidized special pair of photosynthetic reaction centers, also display a near-infrared absorption band. The near-IR band is however distinctly different from that of the \xcf\x80-cation radical dimers. Equilibrium constants for the formation of these new species (M(OEP) + [M(OEP\xe2\x80\xa2)]+ (KMV) [M(OEP\xe2\x80\xa2/2)]2+), have also been determined. The values of KMV are 10\xe2\x88\x92100-fold larger than the analogous dimerization constant KD. Values of \xce\x94H and \xce\x94S have been obtained for both equilibrium processes. The variations in KMV and KD values are largely the consequence of entropy differences that probably result from a much stronger solvation of the \xcf\x80-cation radical compared to the neutral porphyrin.

"The synthesis and characterization of four Lewis base-free, \xcf\x83-bonded lithium aryls are reported. This work was undertaken in order to provide a model for the solid-state structure of phenyllithium, which is currently unknown. Nondonor hydrocarbon solubility of the four lithium aryls (LiC6H3-3,5-t-Bu2)6 (1), (LiC6H4-4-t-Bu)n (2), (LiC6H4-4-n-Bu)n (3), and {LiC6H4-4-SiMe2(t-Bu)}n (4) was achieved by the incorporation of meta- or para-substituents on the aryl rings. This permitted 13C NMR spectroscopy and crystal growth using their solutions. It is proposed that the absence of bulky ortho-substituents allows association of the lithium aryls to occur in a manner similar to that of phenyllithium itself. The 13C NMR data for the ipso-carbon atoms suggest an association number of at least four or, more probably, six in solution. These data are in agreement with the X-ray crystal structure of 1, which is hexameric, with a distorted octahedral (trigonal antiprismatic) array of lithium ions. Six of the eight Li3 faces are capped by an aryl group that interacts primarily through the C(ipso) atom. Weaker Li\xe2\x88\x92C(ortho) interactions are also apparent.

"The quantitative photoreactivities in solution of Roussin\'s red salt (RRS, Na2[Fe2S2(NO)4]) and of Roussin\'s black salt (RBS, NH4[Fe4S3(NO)7]) are described. Photolysis of the red Roussinate anion Fe2S2(NO)42- in aerobic aqueous solution leads to quantitative formation of the black Roussinate anion Fe4S3(NO)7-. The quantum yield for disappearance of Fe2S2(NO)42- (\xce\xa6I = 0.14) is independent of excitation wavelength over a broad range (313\xe2\x88\x92546 nm). Real time detection of nitric oxide by electrochemical sensors in the photolysis solution demonstrated the release of NO with a quantum yield of 0.07. The black Roussinate anion is much less photoactive (\xce\xa6II = 1.1 \xc3\x97 10-3) but does undergo photodecomposition in aerobic solution to give, eventually, ferric precipitates plus NO. These studies were initiated with the goal of developing photochemical strategies for delivering NO to biological targets on demand. In this context, the photolability of Fe2S2(NO)42- was examined as a possible candidate for exploiting the known nitric oxide sensitization of \xce\xb3-radiation induced cell killing in V79 cell cultures (Mitchell, J. B.; et al. Cancer Res. 1993, 53, 5845\xe2\x88\x925848). Hypoxic cell cultures treated with RRS solution (1.0 mM) and then subjected to \xce\xb3-radiation (15 Gy) demonstrated strikingly lower survival rates when simultaneously exposed to white light irradiation than did control systems treated identically but in the dark. The black salt was similarly probed, but its greater toxicity and lower quantum yields for NO release make this a less likely candidate for such photochemically induced radiation sensitization. "
"Diffusion of triethylamine into an ethanol solution containing 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) and zinc(II) nitrate hexahydrate yields crystalline Zn2(BTC)(NO3)\xc2\xb7(H2O)(C2H5OH)5, which was formulated by elemental microanalysis, solid-state NMR, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction [cubic, P213, a = 14.728(2) \xc3\x85, V = 3195(2) \xc3\x853, Z = 4]. This compound possesses a 3-D structure with nearly 44% of the framework represented by an extended channel system having a 14 \xc3\x85 cross-section, where highly mobile ethanol and water guest molecules reside. The multidentate functionality of BTC imparts rigidity to the structure, consequently allowing the guests to be removed or exchanged without destruction of the porous framework. X-ray powder diffraction, solid-state NMR (13C CP MAS and static), gas chromatography, and thermogravimetry analyses reveal that this material is highly selective to alcohols because of the coordination environment adopted by Zn(II) within its framework. Other molecular inclusions such as tetrahydrofuran, methyl ethyl ketone, acetonitrile, and acetone are not permitted into the channels, due to the specific electronic demands of the Zn(II) center and its ability to direct the inclusion process even in cases where incoming molecules have the appropriate shape and size for inclusion.

"The intermetallic compound Na49Cd58.5Sn37.5 was obtained in nearly 100% yield after fusion of the elements in stoichiometric proportions in a Nb container and quenching of the mixture. The structure was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (rhombohedral, R3\xcc\x84m, Z = 3, a = 16.034(1) \xc3\x85, c = 50.64(1) \xc3\x85; R, Rw(F) = 3.3%, 4.2%). The covalently-bonded part of the structure is a network of cadmium and tin that contains the following:\xe2\x80\x89 (a) the first empty icosahedra built without atoms of an element of group 13; (b) 12-bonded 18-atom closo-deltahedra, the largest closo-deltahedron ever made; (c) 20-atom spacers. The sodium cations are located between the clusters and also center the 18-atom cluster. Band calculations on the network and molecular orbital calculations on the 12-bonded 18-atom cluster show that the latter is hyperelectronic with 2n + 4 skeletal electrons, and also that its six lone-pair orbitals are not occupied. Magnetic measurements show small temperature-independent paramagnetism. "
"Transition structures, activation energies, and reaction energies were calculated by ab initio quantum mechanical methods for the Claisen rearrangements of five hydroxy-substituted allyl vinyl ethers. The RHF, DFT(Becke3LYP), and CASSCF methods with the 6-31G* basis set were carried out. There is good agreement with activation energies measured for alkoxy-substituted compounds. The activation energies were separated into thermodynamic and intrinsic effects using Marcus theory as adapted by Murdoch for pericyclic reactions. Intrinsic effects were analyzed by frontier molecular orbital theory. The deuterium kinetic isotope effects calculated at the CASSCF/6-31G* level for the 2-OH allyl vinyl ether are in good agreement with the experimental results for the 2-OSiMe3 derivative, and these calculated isotope effects show much more bond-breaking and less bond-making than those at both the RHF/6-31G* and Becke3LYP/6-31G* levels.

"Ab initio calculations of the vibrational frequencies of W(CO)5NH3 in its ground electronic 1A1 (b22e4) and lowest excited state 3E (b22e3a11) have been performed at the HF level. The calculated frequencies of the \xce\xbd(CO) bands are in agreement with observed data on experimentally studied W(CO)5(amine) molecules. The optimized geometries of the ground and the excited states show that the W\xe2\x88\x92N, W\xe2\x88\x92Ceq, W\xe2\x88\x92Cax, C\xe2\x88\x92Oeq bonds lengthen and the C\xe2\x88\x92Oax bond shortens on excitation. Our results resolve an apparent disagreement between the fast time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopy and the preresonance Raman (PRR) spectroscopy. The unexpected simultaneous lengthening of both W\xe2\x88\x92Ceq and C\xe2\x88\x92Oeq is due to C\xe2\x88\x92Oeq antibonding character in the a1 orbital which more than offsets its loss from the e. In addition a new band, predicted but as yet unresolved in the TRIR, accounts for the C\xe2\x88\x92Oax shortening as expected from the PRR W\xe2\x88\x92Cax lengthening. "
"The [3,2]- and the [1,2]-phosphatoxy rearrangements have been studied in the 2-(phosphatoxy)ethyl radical, the 2-(dimethylphosphatoxy)ethyl radical, and the 2-(phosphatoxy)propyl radical with the Becke3LYP/6-31G(d) density functional method. Barriers have also been calculated through single-point energy calculations at the B3LYP/ 6-311+G(d,p), PMP2/6-31+G(d,p), and, in part, QCISD/6-31G(d) levels of theory. In contrast to acyloxy rearrangements in otherwise identical systems, the [1,2]-shift pathway is slightly preferred in phosphatoxy rearrangements. The degree of charge separation is much more significant in the [3,2]- than the [1,2]-shift pathway. Barriers for phosphatoxy and dimethylphosphatoxy shifts are rather similar for both pathways. Introduction of a methyl group adjacent to the radical center lowers the barrier quite significantly. The effect is larger for the [1,2]- than for the [3,2]-shift. Inspection of the charge and spin density distributions indicates that this effect is composed of steric as well as polar contributions. On the basis of these results, the experimentally found ratio of [1,2]- to [3,2]-phosphatoxy rearrangements should be strongly dependent on solvent polarity as well as substrate substitution pattern. The syn-1,3-elimination of phosphate has been described as a novel reaction type. The barrier for this process is significantly lower than for syn-1,2-elimination of phosphate from closed shell substrates, but somewhat above the barriers for 1,2-phosphatoxy rearrangements. "
"Published kinetic results for the FNO3 system suggest that some reactions of FO2 + NO and FO + NO2 may proceed through an FOONO intermediate. This molecule, an isomer of fluorine nitrate, FONO2, has received no experimental and essentially no theoretical study. The present work employs the quadratic configuration interaction method to investigate the structure, vibrational frequencies, and stability of FOONO. Computations at the QCISD(T)/6-311G(3df)//QCISD(T)/6-311G(2d) level of theory lead to (FOONO) = 23.5 \xc2\xb1 4 kcal mol-1. "
"An electronic structural study of the complete valence shell of [1.1.1]propellane is reported. Binding energy spectra were measured in the energy regime of 3.5\xe2\x88\x9246.5 eV over a range of different target electron momenta, so that momentum distributions (MDs) could be determined for each ion state. Each experimental electron momentum distribution is compared with those calculated in the plane wave impulse approximation using both a triple-\xce\xb6 plus polarization level SCF wave function and a further 13 basis sets as calculated using density functional theory. A critical comparison between the experimental and theoretical momentum distributions allows us to determine the optimum wave function for [1.1.1]propellane from the basis sets we studied. In general, the level of agreement between the experimental and theoretical MDs for this optimum wave function for all of the respective valence orbitals is fair. The determination of this wave function then allows us to derive the chemically interesting molecular properties of [1.1.1]propellane. A summary of these results and a comparison of them with those of other workers are presented with the level of agreement typically being good. In particular, we note that we confirm the existence of the C1\xe2\x88\x92C3 bridging bond with a bond order of 0.70. "
"The chemical changes that occurred in two copper-based catalysts (Cu-ZSM-5 and Cu-Al2O3) during the selective reduction of NO with propene in the presence of oxygen were studied using in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). For the quantitative analysis of the XANES spectra, a mathematical procedure based on evolving factor analysis (EFA) has been applied. Correlation with catalytic data shows that copper is fully oxidized in both systems when the conversion of propene is complete and the conversion of NO to N2 reaches its maximum value. The XANES analysis together with comparison of the catalytic behavior of Cu-ZSM-5 with Cu-Al2O3 and Cu-SiO2 systems indicates that the rate limiting step of the reaction takes place on cupic oxides (although other species may also participate). This conclusion is of general significance because it establishes the physical basis for the role of Cu in selective catalytic reduction of NO by hydrocarbons; this explains the recently recognized fact that zeolitic supports do not play an essential role in the reaction and that the mechanism may not involve a Cu2+/Cu1+ redox cycle or, if it does, the cycle is dominated by the oxidized species. In situ XANES analysis coupled with EFA is demonstrated to be a useful technique to obtain information about the active sites present on a catalyst during reaction. "
"A procedure is described for probing changes in 15N T1 relaxation rates and nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) with viscosity as a function of temperature. The large freezing-point depression and high viscosities of 8.8 M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)\xe2\x88\x92water solutions allowed study of the molecular motions of several ammonium salts, amides, and heterocycles on the pico- to nanosecond time scale. Dipole\xe2\x88\x92dipole interactions provide the dominant form of relaxation for the ammonium salts, but chemical-shift anisotropy (CSA) also plays a significant role in the relaxation of amides and heterocycles. For pyridine, CSA is a particularly important mechanism and the shielding anisotropy of pyridine in 8.8 M DMSO\xe2\x88\x92water is estimated to be on the order of 325 ppm. The 15N NOE of NH4Cl is greater than the theoretical maximum for intramolecular dipolar relaxation at high viscosities, and can be accounted for either by significant intermolecular contributions operating on a different time scale or by rapid motional averaging.

"A flash-quench method has been developed to probe oxidative damage to DNA. A photoexcited Ru(II) intercalator is quenched in DNA by a weakly bound, electron-transfer quencher to generate Ru(III), a powerful ground-state oxidant. Once generated, \xce\x94-Ru(phen)2(dppz)3+ bound to poly(dG-dC) rapidly oxidizes guanine within the DNA duplex. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicates rapid formation of the neutral guanine radical within the DNA duplex. Permanent damage resulting from the flash-quench experiment is monitored by gel electrophoresis of synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes. Oxidative damage, visualized by treatment with piperidine, occurs selectively at the 5\xe2\x80\x98-G of 5\xe2\x80\x98-GG-3\xe2\x80\x98 sites and at the 5\xe2\x80\x98- and central G of 5\xe2\x80\x98-GGG-3\xe2\x80\x98 triplets; enzymatic digestion in the absence of piperidine treatment shows formation of 8-oxo-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine with Ru(NH3)63+ as quencher. The yield of base damage is, furthermore, modulated by the choice of electron-transfer quencher. Quantum yields for damage vary in the order Ru(NH3)63+ < methyl viologen2+ < Co(NH3)5Cl2+ and correlate with the instability of the reduced quencher. The flash-quench method, combining spectroscopy and product analysis, offers a novel and tunable approach to explore electron transfer chemistry on double helical DNA. "
"Photoexcitation of chloranil (CA) produces initially the excited singlet state 1CA*, as demonstrated for the first time by time-resolved spectroscopy on the femtosecond/picosecond time scale. Electron transfer from aromatic donors (D) to singlet chloranil leads to short-lived (ca. 5 ps) singlet radical-ion pairs, 1[D\xe2\x80\xa2+, CA\xe2\x80\xa2-]. This ultrafast quenching process competes with intersystem crossing (kISC \xe2\x89\x88 1011 s-1) to generate the triplet excited state, 3CA*. The follow-up electron transfer from D to 3CA* yields triplet radical-ion pairs, which are distinguished from their singlet analogues by their long (nanosecond) lifetimes. The competition between electron transfer and intersystem crossing on the early picosecond time scale also pertains to a wide variety of other photoexcited quinones related to chloranil. Electron transfer to singlet quinone as established here adds a new dimension to the generally accepted mechanisms which proceed from the triplet state, and the inclusion of reactions on both the triplet and the singlet manifolds provides a complete picture of photoinduced electron transfer to various quinone acceptors. "
"Through a comparative analysis of the reactivity and DNA cleaving activity of neocarzinostatin (NCS) chromophore (1) and the corresponding aglycon (2), we show that the carbohydrate residue (aminoglycoside) of 1 both accelerates the rate and improves the efficiency of DNA cleavage versus the aglycon (2), but does not appear to be a major determinant of the base specificity of DNA cleavage by 1. This stands in contrast to earlier findings with another enediyne antibiotic, calicheamicin \xce\xb31, where the carbohydrate residue was found to be a major determinant of the sequence specificity of DNA cleavage, in addition to playing a functional role in the reductive activation step. Thiol addition experiments with NCS aglycon (2) provide further evidence that the carbohydrate amino group of 1 functions as an internal base in the first step leading to DNA cleavage, thiol activation. Evidence is also presented supporting the proposal that NCS aglycon (2) is bound tightly and reversibly by the neocarzinostatin binding protein (apo-NCS) and that this binding stabilizes the aglycon in solution.

"The stereochemical course of reduction of crotonyl CoA by the novel crotonyl CoA reductase (CCR) of Streptomyces collinus was determined using a radiochemical assay. The reaction was shown to proceed with transfer of the hydrogen from the pro-4S position of NADPH to the Re face of the \xce\xb2-carbon of crotonyl CoA. This transfer represents the first exception to the observation that enoyl thioester reductases catalyze transfer of the pro-4S hydrogen of NADPH to the Si face of the substrate. The observation of addition of solvent hydrogen to the Re face of the \xce\xb1-carbon in the reaction catalyzed by CCR demonstrated that the overall reduction of crotonyl CoA proceeds in an anti fashion. The overall stereochemical outcome of the reaction catalyzed by CCR is different to the four stereochemical outcomes that have previously been observed for enoyl thioester reductases. It is significant that the predicted amino acid sequence of CCR has also been shown to be unrelated to other enoyl thioester reductases. Based on these observations it is proposed that the stereochemical course of an enoyl thioester reduction serves no mechanistic function but merely reflects the pedigree or ancestral lineage of the enzyme. Any two enoyl thioester reductases which exhibit different stereospecificities are, therefore, predicted to have different pedigrees and unrelated amino acid sequences. An evaluation of all the enoyl thioester reductases where both the stereochemical course of reduction and the predicted amino acid sequence are known is shown to be entirely consistent with these predictions.

"The excited-state photophysics of the light induced antiviral agent, hypericin, are compared with those of its methylated analog, hexamethoxyhypericin. This comparison is instructive in understanding both the ground- and the excited-state properties of hypericin. That the hexamethoxy analog has no labile protons that can be transferred, that it cannot protonate its own carbonyl groups, that it has a reduced fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime with respect to hypericin, and that it exhibits no stimulated emission or, more specifically, rise time in stimulated emission completely support our emerging model of the hypericin photophysics. The results are consistent with the presence of intramolecular excited-state proton transfer in hypericin but not in its methylated analog. "
"Gas-phase ion mobility measurements have been used to characterize the conformations of the +4 to +22 charge states of apomyoglobin. For the +8 to +10 charge states, generated by electrospraying pH \xe2\x89\x883 solutions, two relatively compact conformations were resolved which may reflect the state of the protein in solution. These relatively compact conformations unfold into more extended conformations when collisionally heated. Only extended conformations are observed for the high (>+10) charge states, and they become more extended as the charge increases. Proton stripping of the higher (>+7) charge states to produce the +4 to +7 charge states results in spontaneous collapse into partially folded conformations. Further folding is observed upon collisional heating of the collapsed structures, indicating the presence of an activation barrier for protein folding in the gas phase. The barrier probably results from Coulomb repulsion and the reorganization of secondary structure. For the lower (<+7) charge states, the most stable conformations appear to be slightly more compact than the native protein in solution. The collision cross sections per residue for the extended conformations of apomyoglobin and cytochrome c are similar. The cross sections for the compact folded conformations of these proteins also scale with the number of residues. This suggests that different proteins share common structural motifs in the gas phase, as they do in solution. "
"We report here measurements of the orientational and frequency dependence of the anomalously large second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) susceptibilities observed in guest\xe2\x88\x92host DANS [4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-4\xe2\x80\x98-nitrostilbene]/PMMA [poly(methyl methacrylate)] films poled in an \xe2\x80\x9cin-plane\xe2\x80\x9d electrode configuration. The resonant response is sharply peaked (fwhm decreases by a factor of 4) in comparison to identical samples poled by standard corona field techniques. Additionally, these anomalous susceptibilities, which are oriented normal to the electric poling field, exhibit unusually strong features at long wavelengths where the linear absorption is low. We also report the first direct experimental EPR evidence for nitrogen-centered cation radicals, hence the creation of charged chromophores trapped in the polymeric matrix by charge injection from the poling electrodes. These observations are in qualitative agreement with the very large NLO response magnitudes and distinct spectral features predicted by sum-over-states perturbative calculations performed for positively charged centrosymmetric chromophore dimers and provide strong computational evidence that the observed anomalous NLO response is due to charged chromophore aggregates. "
"This contribution presents a quantum chemical investigation of the nonlinear optical response of charged centrosymmetric aggregates of the archetypical chromophore p-nitroaniline using an ab initio supermolecular approach. Localized hole states, responsible for aggregate nonlinearity, are predicted to be more stable than delocalized states. The calculated aggregate hyperpolarizabilities are consistently larger than in the isolated chromophore, and the mechanism giving rise to the nonlinearity is essentially \xe2\x80\x9cintramolecular\xe2\x80\x9d in nature. The aggregate formation is predicted to stabilize the positive charge and to enhance the nonlinearity. Moreover, the calculations reveal that a (formally) centrosymmetric charged aggregate can possess a substantial dipole moment the principal axis of which is oriented perpendicular to the principal hyperpolarizability tensor; the dipole moment arises because electron localization breaks the charge distribution symmetry. These results explain a number curious features of chromophoric polymer films which are electric field poled with an \xe2\x80\x9cin-plane\xe2\x80\x9d electrode geometry. "
"A model of the interaction of substrates and inhibitors with xanthine oxidase (XO) based on similarity concepts and molecular modeling is introduced and discussed, and previous literature is reexamined in the light of recent insights into the mechanism and structure of XO. Use is made of quantum-chemical calculations with the inclusion of solvent effects, molecular superimposition with least-squares fitting algorithms, and molecular electrostatic potentials. First, the relative stabilities of the tautomeric forms of the physiological substrates, xanthine and hypoxanthine, are calculated both in vacuo and in water in order to select the most abundant form(s) at physiological pH:\xe2\x80\x89 the two substrates prove to be stable in their lactam forms, with a dominance of the N7-H tautomer for xanthine and of N9-H for hypoxanthine. The structures of xanthine and hypoxanthine are then superimposed, and their relative orientation with respect to the molybdenum center of XO is suggested. The criteria used for superimposition reflect the importance of functional groups of xanthine and hypoxanthine, as inferred from experimental work. In particular, the carbonyl oxygen common to the two substrates is given special consideration on account of its determinant role. The results show that the most important functional groups of the two substrates can be successfully superimposed by means of a rotation that exchanges the five-membered with the six-membered rings of xanthine and hypoxanthine with respect to molybdenum. The close similarity of the electrostatic potentials of the two superimposed molecules adds weight to the proposed orientation of the substrates in the binding site. The model of interaction is then tested and further developed using a series of previously-synthesized dimensional analogs of xanthine and hypoxanthine. The results confirm that the correct positioning of the carbonyl group is essential if a productive interaction with XO is to be achieved and allow us to map the dimensions of the active site starting from the superimposition of the physiological substrates. Two hypotheses regarding the amino acid residues interacting with the important carbonyl oxygen of the substrates are then put forward on the basis of spectroscopic and biochemical evidence:\xe2\x80\x89 they are postulated to be one lysine or one protonated glutamic acid residue. In an attempt to unify the binding of substrates and inhibitors, the model is extended to the inhibitors of XO by superimposing the most interesting inhibitors developed by Robins on xanthine and hypoxanthine. This allows us to define the most suitable location of the phenyl rings of these inhibitors with respect to the superimposition of the substrates. Intriguingly, the superimpositions of the most active inhibitors are consistent with a unique location of their phenyl rings, even though they are in different positions on the purine ring. Finally, the flavone, which is a potent inhibitor of XO and is currently under investigation by the authors, is accounted for by these findings and successfully included in the model. This model incorporates many important insights into XO and can be of general interest. Moreover, it represents a clear-cut alternative to a previous model developed by Robins on the basis of the coordination of substrates and inhibitors to molybdenum. "
"Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Au(111) formed by microcontact printing of dodecanethiol and investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and wettability measurements have, under certain conditions, characteristics indistinguishable from SAMs formed from solutions of dodecanethiol in ethanol. The monolayer product of microcontact printing demonstrates a sensitivity to the concentration of thiol used to ink a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) stamp needed to make the print and an insensitivity to its duration of contact, for times >0.3 s, with the gold substrate. The wettability of the SAM, the distribution of domains within the monolayer, their size and organizational state, and the pattern of depressions on the surface each are reproducibly controlled by simply changing the concentration of dodecanethiol applied to the stamp. The inferred mode of growth of printed SAMs shares many features of monolayer formation through the gas phase of a thiol and corresponds to a highly controlled and self-limiting delivery of thiol from the interior parts of the PDMS. Our study shows that printed SAMs provide a wonderful opportunity to change controllably the order in monolayers at the nanometer scale and to examine its effects on microscopic and macroscopic properties of these films.

"{5-[[[2\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-Bis[(4\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-(n-(perfluoroalkyl)alkoxy)benzoyl)oxy]benzyl]oxy]carbonyl]bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene}s were polymerized by ring-opening metathesis polymerization in THF at 40 \xc2\xb0C using Mo(CHCMe2Ph)(N-2,6-iPr2Ph)(OtBu)2 as the initiator. 2,5-Bis[(4\xe2\x80\x98-(n-(perfluoroalkyl)alkoxy)benzoyl)oxy]toluenes mimic both the phases formed by the poly{5-[[[2\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-bis[(4\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-(n-(perfluoroalkyl)alkoxy)benzoyl)oxy]benzyl]oxy]carbonyl]bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene}s and the general temperatures of their transitions, and are therefore excellent models of the polymers. In contrast to their hydrocarbon analogs which exhibit only nematic mesophases, all of the polymers and their low molar mass model compounds exhibit smectic C and smectic A mesophases. In both cases, all of the transition temperatures decrease with increasing hydrocarbon length and increase with increasing fluorocarbon length. "
"A general means for enhancing the extent to which squarate esters enter into cascade processes involving a dianionic oxy-Cope rearrangement as the key step is presented. Adoption of this sigmatropic process requires that the two alkenyllithium reagents being introduced add cis to each other, a kinetic bias which can be realized simply by the proper incorporation of ethereal oxygen substituents in the first organometallic reagent. Structural reorganization occurs via boat-like transition states such that stereoinduction manifests itself with high fidelity. "
"The synthesis, characterization, and electrochemistry of a series of Rh(I) bis(phosphine), \xce\xb76-arene, piano-stool complexes are reported. The study reported herein elucidates several of the important factors which lead to the stabilization of Rh(II) in this coordination environment. From the electrochemical data for a series of complexes of the type [Rh(\xce\xb72-dppe)(\xce\xb76-C6H6-nXn)]BF4 (X = CH3, n = 0\xe2\x88\x926) (1\xe2\x88\x927) it was shown that the addition of methyl groups to the arene ligand kinetically stabilize the Rh(II) center and thermodynamically stabilize the Rh(II) species by 16 mV per added methyl group. Furthermore, complexes which contain chelation to the arene ligand, such as [Rh(\xce\xb76:\xce\xb71-Ph(CH2)3PPh2)(\xce\xb71-Ph(CH2)3PPh2)]BF4 (12), kinetically stabilize the Rh(II) form, presumably from ligand substitution based decomposition reactions. The electrochemical studies of five isostructural and isoelectronic complexes, [Rh(\xce\xb72-dppe)(\xce\xb76-C6H5CH3)]BF4 (2), [Rh(\xce\xb71-n-BuPPh2)2(\xce\xb76-C6H5CH3)]BF4 (8), [Rh(\xce\xb72-dppp)(\xce\xb76-C6H5CH3)]BF4 (9), [Rh(\xce\xb72-dppb)(\xce\xb76-C6H5CH3)]BF4 (10), and 12 show that those complexes which contain bidentate, bis(phosphine) chelation with an ethyl or butyl bridge, 2 and 10, thermodynamically destabilize the Rh(II) form relative to those complexes which contain a less restricted bis(phosphine) chelate or no bis(phosphine) chelation. Using single-crystal X-ray data and extended H\xc3\xbcckel calculations, these counterintuitive electrochemical trends were explained in terms of not only the properties of the Rh(I) complex but also, in terms of the structural changes which are likely to occur upon oxidation of the metal center from Rh(I) to Rh(II).

"Adenosylcobinamide (AdoCbi+) plus N-methylimidazole (N-MeIm), [AdoCbi\xc2\xb7N-MeIm]+BF4-, has been studied with the goal of providing a chemical precedent for the benzimidazole base-off, protein histidine base-on form of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl, also coenzyme B12) found in the recent X-ray crystallographic structural study of methylmalonyl-CoA (MMCoA) mutase. Specifically, the axial-base binding Kassoc and associated \xce\x94H and \xce\x94S thermodynamic parameters for [AdoCbi\xc2\xb7N-MeIm]+BF4- have been obtained as well as its Co\xe2\x88\x92C thermolytic cleavage products and kinetic parameters. The thermodynamic studies reveal that imidazole is unique among the aromatic nitrogenous bases tested, with a more favorable \xce\x94H = \xe2\x88\x927.8 \xc2\xb1 0.4 kcal/mol but a compensatingly less favorable \xce\x94S = \xe2\x88\x9228 \xc2\xb1 1 eu when binding to AdoCbi+. A stronger, shorter Co\xe2\x88\x92N (N-MeIm) bond is implied for [AdoCbi\xc2\xb7N-MeIm]+ (i.e., vs pyridine as the axial base). The product studies reveal that imidazole changes the mode of Co\xe2\x88\x92C cleavage from \xe2\x89\xa598% homolysis (for the appended 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole in AdoCbl) to \xe2\x88\xbc50% homolysis and \xe2\x88\xbc50% abiological heterolysis for [AdoCbi\xc2\xb7N-MeIm]+. The kinetic studies demonstrate that both Co\xe2\x88\x92C homolysis and heterolysis are accelerated by the record amounts of 8- and 350-fold, respectively, vs the reference point of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole base-on AdoCbl (and by a record 870- and 30\xe2\x80\x89700-fold, respectively vs the reference point of the solvent ethylene glycol as the axial base, [AdoCbi\xc2\xb7ethylene glycol]+). The biological significance of these findings is discussed, notably (i) that the MMCoA mutase subclass of B12-dependent enzymes must either (a) utilize or (b) prevent Co\xe2\x88\x92C heterolysis and (ii) the expectation that a long, \xe2\x80\x9cideal\xe2\x80\x9d length Co\xe2\x88\x92N(imidazole) is one key way the enzyme can inhibit Co\xe2\x88\x92C heterolysis as well as accelerate Co\xe2\x88\x92C homolysis. Also discussed are the steric and electronic differences of imidazole vs pyridine axial-ligands, including the literature of imidazole\'s \xcf\x80-bonding interactions. Finally, a brief summary of the needed [AdoCbi\xc2\xb7base]+ and [Co(II)Cbi\xc2\xb7base]+ structural, computational, and other additional studies is presented. "
"A new tris(ZnII\xe2\x88\x92cyclen) (Zn3L3), which has three ZnII\xe2\x88\x92macrocyclic tetraamine (cyclen) complexes connected through a 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene spacer, has been synthesized as a novel receptor for organic phosphate dianions in aqueous solution (cyclen = 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane and L3 = 1,3,5-tris(1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecan-1-ylmethyl)benzene). The design of Zn3L3 was based on X-ray crystal structure analysis of the 1:3 complex of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (NPP2-) with ZnII\xe2\x88\x92cyclen (ZnL1) complex. The potentiometric pH titration of Zn3L3\xc2\xb73H2O revealed the deprotonation constants of the three ZnII-bound H2O molecules to be 6.1 (pK1), 7.3 (pK2), and 8.6 (pK3) at 25 \xc2\xb0C with I = 0.1 (NaNO3). These three stepwise deprotonations and 1H NMR spectra changes at various pD values in D2O suggest that strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds link each adjacent ZnII\xe2\x88\x92OH2 (or ZnII\xe2\x88\x92OH-) at neutral pH in aqueous solution. At higher pH (>9), the hydrogen bond network disrupts. The 31P NMR titration of Zn3L3\xc2\xb73H2O with phenyl phosphate dianion (PP2-) in D2O confirmed the formation of a 1:1 complex (Zn3L3\xe2\x88\x92PP2-). By potentiometric pH titrations, the 1:1 complex affinity constants, log Kaff (Kaff = [phosphate complex]/[ZnII complex][phosphate] (M-1)), were determined to be 5.8 with NPP2-, 6.6 with PP2-, 7.0 with \xce\xb1-d-glucose-1-phosphate, and 7.9 with phenyl phosphonate in aqueous solution. The tris(ZnII\xe2\x88\x92cyclen) complex is found to be a much better host toward phosphates than the parent ZnII\xe2\x88\x92cyclen (ZnL1) (log Kaff = 3.3 for ZnL1\xe2\x88\x92NPP2-) or a bis(ZnII\xe2\x88\x92cyclen) linked with a m-xylene spacer (Zn2L2) (log Kaff = 4.0 for Zn2L2\xe2\x88\x92NPP2-).

"The migratory insertion reaction of NO into the Co\xe2\x88\x92CH3 \xcf\x83-bond in the cobalt cyclopentadienyl complex CpCo(NO)(CH3) (2), both with and without the assistance of an incoming ligand (PH3, 1), has been studied using ab initio molecular orbital and density functional theory (DFT) methods. The insertion without PH3 association (Mechanism I) occurs with an activation energy of 10\xe2\x88\x9220 kcal/mol, and the intermediate, CpCoN(O)CH3 (3a), forms with an endothermicity of 8\xe2\x88\x9217 kcal/mol at the DFT-B3LYP and coupled cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD) levels of theory. The overall reaction to the product, CpCoN(O)CH3(PH3) (5b), was exothermic by \xe2\x88\x9210 to \xe2\x88\x9216 kcal/mol depending on the level of theory. An alternative mechanism II which begins with PH3 association and NO bending is endothermic by 16\xe2\x88\x9218 kcal/mol and is immediately followed by a NO insertion barrier of 19\xe2\x88\x9234 kcal/mol for an overall barrier of 35\xe2\x88\x9252 kcal/mol. Therefore, Mechanism I is the favored pathway. This result is in very good agreement with the kinetic experiments of Weiner and Bergman. Charge density and Laplacian analysis at the RHF level and the MO analysis from extended H\xc3\xbcckel calculations reveal that the Co center plays a dual, electron acceptor and donor, role in the migratory insertion for both Mechanisms I and II. For Mechanism I the better acceptor and donor character of the metal center results in a lower activation energy as it cycles from a d8 (18e-) complex at 2 to a d8 (16e-) intermediate at 3 and back to a d8 (18e-) product at 5. In contrast, for Mechanism II the original \xcf\x83Co-C orbital must rise to high energy before it can transfer charge density to the dxz orbital of the product as it cycles from a d8 (18e-) complex at 2 to a d6 (18e-) intermediate (4) and back to a d8 (18e-) complex at 5, a cycle which consequently requires a greater activation energy.

"The crystal structure of the cumyl cation (1; 2-phenyl-2-propyl cation) has been determined at \xe2\x88\x92124 \xc2\xb0C (as hexafluoroantimonate, 1\xc2\xb7SbF6; R1 = 0.0502, wR2 = 0.1054). The cation 1 is nearly planar and has a short C+\xe2\x88\x92Cipso bond (1.41(2) \xc3\x85) and bond lengths in the phenyl ring which agree with strong benzylic delocalization. The weak but distinct shortening of the C+\xe2\x88\x92CH3 bonds by 0.025(12) \xc3\x85 indicates weak C\xe2\x88\x92H hyperconjugation. Nearly all H atoms are involved in H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7F contacts to SbF6 anions, and one close C+\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7F contact (3.11(2) \xc3\x85) is observed. The phenyl rings form infinite stacks and are shifted against each other in the stack. "
"Statistical theory is used to calculate the F- + CH3Cl \xe2\x86\x92 FCH3 + Cl- rate constant versus relative translational energy Erel and CH3Cl temperature T. The calculations are performed on a potential energy surface derived from MP2 and QCISD(T) ab initio calculations with the 6-311++G(2df,2pd) basis set. At best, statistical theory only qualitatively reproduces the dependence of the experimental rate constant on translational energy and temperature. Using the height of the central barrier with respect to the pre-reaction complex as an adjustable parameter, the experimental rate constant at Erel = 0.9 kcal/mol and T = 296 K may be fit by statistical theory with a central barrier 3 kcal/mol higher than that determined from the QCISD(T) calculation. The calculation of the SN2 rate constant is insensitive to whether the unified statistical model or standard RRKM branching ratio expression is used. Also, including anharmonicity for the F--\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89-CH3Cl complex does not affect the calculated rate constant. A comparison of statistical rate constants with parametrized trajectory capture rate constants suggests that, during the entrance channel capture dynamics, the F- + CH3Cl relative translation and CH3Cl rotation motions are strongly and weakly coupled at low and high Erel, respectively.

"A variety of plausible mechanisms for methane hydroxylation in methane monooxygenases (MMO) have been tested by high-level quantum chemical methods on model systems with simple ligands chosen on the basis of the MMO crystal structure and the available biophysical data. One pathway survives the present level of tests in having intermediates with plausible energies and structures and a low-energy transition state for C\xe2\x88\x92H abstraction. In this proposed pathway, the Fe2(II,II) dinuclear iron site of the reduced form of MMO reacts with O2 to give two different Fe2(III,III) peroxo species and, after O\xe2\x88\x92O bond cleavage, an Fe2(IV,IV) bis-\xce\xbc-oxo species probably directly analogous to \xe2\x80\x9ccompound Q\xe2\x80\x9d of MMO. As a result of the large Jahn\xe2\x88\x92Teller distortions in the d4 bis-\xce\xbc-oxo species, the Fe\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92Fe bridges are highly asymmetric, allowing the system to open up easily to a key FeIII\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92FeVO intermediate that is shown to be capable of reacting with methane via a low-energy transition state. This intermediate is shown to be better regarded as having the structure FeIII\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92FeIV\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x80\xa2, with radical character at the terminal oxo group. After H atom abstraction from methane, the methyl radical recombines very rapidly with the Fe center via a weak Fe\xe2\x88\x92CH3 bond. With the loss of CH3OH, an FeIII\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92FeIII dimer is formed that requires reduction to form the Fe2(II,II) starting species. In addition to the work on the dinuclear species, results on a number of relevant mononuclear Fe(III) and Fe(IV) species are also reported. "
"The electronic spectrum of the unnatural nucleic acid base 2-aminopurine is important in order to understand the spectroscopy and photophysics of the normal DNA bases. Knowledge of transition moment directions and effective absorption components is also a prerequisite for the interpretation of emission spectra of 2-aminopurine incorporated into DNA as a probe of nucleic acid base motion or excitation energy transfer processes. Using linear dichroism, fluorescence anisotropy, and ordinary and magnetic circular dichroism techniques, the near-UV spectrum of 2-aminopurine is resolved into contributions from five electronic transitions. Four moderately strong \xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* transitions (I, III, IV, and V) are observed, polarized at +53\xc2\xb0 (I), \xe2\x88\x9272\xc2\xb0 (III), \xe2\x88\x9277\xc2\xb0 (IV), and +57\xc2\xb0 or \xe2\x88\x9267\xc2\xb0 (V) relative to the short molecular axis. In addition, one weak n \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* transition (II) polarized perpendicular to the molecular plane has been identified. Semiempirical INDO/S calculations support these assignments. "
"The dispersion of the water 1H longitudinal relaxation rate in the frequency range 2\xe2\x88\x92100 MHz has been measured in aqueous solutions of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and a mutant protein (G36S) lacking one of the four internal water molecules. The 1H relaxation dispersion has also been measured for BPTI in a series of H2O/D2O mixtures. The quantitative analysis of these data resolve the major controversies in the interpretation of water 1H relaxation data from protein solutions and has implications for medical magnetic resonance imaging. Three principal conclusions are drawn. First, as previously found for the water 2H and 17O dispersions, the BPTI \xe2\x88\x92 G36S difference 1H dispersion can be quantitatively accounted for by a single, fully ordered, internal water molecule (W122). The intrinsic relaxation rate of these water protons is ca. 70% intramolecular, with the intramolecular dipole coupling constant as in ice, and ca. 30% intermolecular, with significant dipole couplings to many BPTI protons. Second, exchanging protons in the protein make a substantial contribution to the observed water 1H relaxation rate. This contribution should be dominant even at neutral pH for most proteins. Third, the effect of intermolecular dipole couplings with protein protons is additive, and cross-relaxation effects are negligible. A theoretical analysis of dipole relaxation in a multispin system undergoing chemical exchange with an abundant bulk phase shows that this conclusion holds generally within the regime of motional narrowing theory.

"Formation of a new class of layered, microcrystalline polymers from a simple hydrolytic polycondensation of n-alkyltrichlorosilanes in water is demonstrated. The structure of the polymeric condensate, determined from a combination of spectroscopic, diffraction, and thermal analysis techniques, consists of highly uniform, pillared microcrystallites in which the inorganic siloxy backbones are present in periodic layers, each containing a monomolecular layer of intercalated water, separated by crystalline assemblies of alkyl chains. The alkyl-chain organization shows a remarkable resemblance to that in highly organized, self-assembled monolayers formed from the precursor silane molecules on hydrophilic substrates and this parallel lends support to the critical importance of water in monolayer self-assembly of silanes. "
"A new series of nonlinear optical molecules are described where the ground state polarization is predominantly zwitterionic when the molecules are dissolved in solution. The molecules, which are derived in general from facile reactions between tertiary amines and tetracyano-p-quinodimethane (TCNQ), are of a type where the stabilization of the charge-separated ground state is favored by an increase in aromaticity over the neutral, quinoidal forms of the molecules. The measured second-order optical nonlinearity of one in the series has been measured by hyper-Rayleigh scattering and a figure of merit value, \xce\xbc\xce\xb2(0), being the product of the dipole moment and static first hyperpolarizability, is found to be 9500 \xc3\x97 10-48 esu. This value, which is higher than most other reported values, is taken from studies in chlorinated solvents of relatively low polarity, but the discussion emphasizes the evolution of \xce\xbc\xce\xb2(0) with solvent polarity, showing that even higher values could be expected with only modest increases in the polarity of the surrounding medium. The analysis of experimental data taken during dipole moment studies is thoroughly examined, and it is concluded that full account must be taken of the molecular shape to correlate the results with theoretical calculations. An ellipsoidal reaction field model is preferred for these highly one-dimensional molecules having strongly anisotropic polarizabilities. "
"Mono- and polyhydroxytropolones are potent competitive inhibitors of inositol monophosphatase. Modeling studies indicate that this inhibition occurs most probably through a novel mode of action involving the chelation of the two magnesium ions in the active site. This is consistent with experimental data. Inhibition occurs when at least three oxygen atoms are present on the seven-membered ring, and only if they are contiguous to one another. In addition, those oxygens should not be protected. The corresponding six-membered rings showed no activity. Other bimetallic enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase (APase) or dopamine \xce\xb2-monooxygenase (DBM) are also inhibited (in a competitive or uncompetitive manner) by hydroxytropolones. "
"The solution and solid structure of Boc-l-Val-\xce\x94Phe-\xce\x94Phe-\xce\x94Phe-l-Val-OMe, containing three consecutive \xce\x94Phe residues, have been determined by X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance, and circular dichroism methods. The crystals grown from aqueous methanol are orthorhombic, space group P212121, a = 11.624(2), b = 17.248(2), c = 21.532 \xc3\x85, V = 4216 (1) \xc3\x853, Z = 4. In the solid state, the peptide exhibits a left-handed 310-helical conformation, in spite of the presence of two l-Val residues. NMR and CD studies in different solvents also support the crystal structure data, suggesting that the solid state structure is maintained in solution as well. This is the first report of a dehydropeptide containing three consecutive \xce\x94Phe residues and exhibiting left-handed 310-helical conformation, which demonstrates the remarkable conformational consequences produced by consecutive occurrence of \xce\x94Phe residues in a peptide. "
"To help determine how amino acid sequence can influence ionic conduction properties in \xce\xb1-helical structures, we have synthesized and studied three closely related, channel-forming peptides. The sequences are based on a 21-residue amphiphilic Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Leu-Ser-Leu heptad repeat motif and differ in having either neutral, negatively, or positively charged N-termini. The channels formed by the neutral peptide are modestly cation selective and exhibit asymmetric current-voltage curves arising from the partial charges at the ends of the \xce\xb1-helix. Addition of a negatively charged Glu residue converted the channel to a completely cation-selective structure and essentially eliminated its rectification. Addition of a positively charged Arg residue near the N-terminus of the peptide reduced this channel\'s cation selectivity and increased the extent of rectification. These effects on channel ionic conductance can be explained by a theoretical electrostatic model and provide insights into the workings of more complex channel proteins. "
"Ethyl-, n-propyl- and [(trimethylsilyl)methyl]niobium (4e)-alkyne complexes Tp*Nb(Cl)(CH2R)(PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeCR\xe2\x80\x98) (Tp* = hydrotris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate; R = Me, R\xe2\x80\x98 = Me (2a), Et (2b), n-Pr (2c); R = Et, R\xe2\x80\x98 = Me (3a), Et (3b); R = SiMe3, R\xe2\x80\x98 = Me (4a)) exhibit \xce\xb1-agostic structures in solution (1H and 13C NMR) and in the solid state (X-ray structure at 173 K for 4a). The phenylpropyne complexes 2a, 3a, and 4a undergo a thermally induced rearrangement which yields niobium methyl complexes Tp*Nb(Cl)(Me)(PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeCEt), Tp*Nb(Cl)(Me)(PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeC\xe2\x88\x92n-Pr), and Tp*Nb(Cl)(Me)(PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeCCH2SiMe3), respectively. This reaction follows a first-order rate law. The rate decreases with increased steric bulk of the alkyl group in the starting complex. For 2a, a full kinetic analysis yields a high enthalpic barrier and an entropy of activation close to zero. Heating a toluene solution of Tp*Nb(Cl)(n-Pr)(PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeCEt) (3b) establishes a 1:1 equilibrium between 3b itself and Tp*Nb(Cl)(Et)(PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeC\xe2\x88\x92n-Pr) (2c). Heating a solution of Tp*Nb(Cl)(Et)(PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeCEt) (2b) and PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeCMe yields the \xce\xb71-alkenyl (4e)-phenylpropyne complex Tp*Nb(Cl)(\xce\xb71-CPhCEt2)(PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeCMe) (6), demonstrating that alkyl migration is a key step of the rearrangement. Under pseudo-first-order conditions, this reaction does not depend on the phenylpropyne concentration. Potential 2e-donor ligands fail to act as efficient traps. Accordingly, a successful trapping experiment involves dinitrogen extrusion from N3P(N\xe2\x88\x92i-Pr2)2 in the presence of 2b which yields an unprecedented (phosphinoimido)niobium complex:\xe2\x80\x89 Tp*Nb(Cl)(\xce\xb71-CPhCEt2)[N-P(N\xe2\x88\x92i-Pr2)2] (7). The crystal structure of 7 confirms the \xce\xb71-alkenyl formulation and reveals a formal Nb\xe2\x88\x92N triple bond, a linear Nb\xe2\x88\x92N\xe2\x88\x92P link, and a pyramidal P. Deoxygenation of propene oxide and desulfurization of ethylene sulfide gives, respectively, the oxo and sulfido \xce\xb71-alkenyl complexes Tp*Nb(Cl)(\xce\xb71-CPhCEt2)(X) (X = O (8), S (9)). The observed thermal rearrangements are unique examples of reversible migratory insertion/\xce\xb2-alkyl elimination in transition metal alkyl alkyne complexes. In the absence of efficient trapping agent, the unsaturated \xce\xb72-alkenyl intermediate that is first generated reversibly ring opens and ring closes. This realizes the intramolecular C\xe2\x88\x92C bond activation which leads to the observed alkyl switch. Kinetic and trapping data indicate that the migratory insertion of the alkyl group on to the alkyne is the rate-determining step of the whole process. "
"Hemicarcerands 1\xe2\x88\x929, composed by coupling through four O(CH2)4O or four 1,3-(OCH2)2C6H4 bridging units in different pair combinations of three tetrol bowls (varying spanners, O(CH2)nO, n = 1, 2, or 3), have been examined for their abilities to incarcerate a variety of organic guest compounds of widely differing structures. When the conformationally flexible tetrol bowl (spanners = O(CH2)3O) was coupled lip-to-lip to either of two rigid bowl units (spanners = OCH2O or O(CH2)2O), the rigid units tended to impose their shapes on the mobile units in the resulting hosts (1H NMR spectral and crystal structure evidence). Complexes were formed by heating to high temperatures host dissolved in a large excess of guest. High structural recognition in complexation was observed for the 1,3-(OCH2)2C6H4-bridged hosts to favor binding of 1,2-disubstituted as compared to 1,3- and 1,4-disubstituted benzenes as guests. Three new crystal structures of hemicarceplexes identical except for their spanner lengths are compared, and a fourth new structure allows comparison of identical hosts with different guests. Decomplexation rates are compared in some cases. Interesting new kinds of restricted rotations of guests with respect to hosts were observed. Three examples of trace impurities in guests being scavenged by the host were encountered. "
"The activity and substrate specificity of subtilisin-catalyzed acylation of nucleosides in organic solvents can be controlled by lyophilizing the enzyme from an aqueous solution containing the substrate. This \xe2\x80\x9cmolecular imprinting\xe2\x80\x9d technique was examined using thymidine as a model nucleoside, and the resulting subtilisin preparation was up to 50-fold more reactive toward thymidine acylation in nearly anhydrous tetrahydrofuran than subtilisin lyophilized from aqueous buffer in the absence of the nucleoside. Although several compounds lyophilized with subtilisin, including thymine and ribose, improved the rate of thymidine acylation, the thymidine-imprinted enzyme was the most efficient catalyst for this reaction. Furthermore, it was possible to alter the substrate selectivity of subtilisin by lyophilizing the enzyme in the presence of a different nucleophilic substrate. For example, imprinting made possible the discrimination between structurally different (i.e., sucrose versus thymidine) as well as structurally similar (i.e., thymidine versus deoxyadenosine) nucleophiles. Molecular modeling studies of the interaction of thymidine or the unrelated sucrose with subtilisin revealed that structural changes upon imprinting in the serine protease\'s catalytic triad may be responsible for the observed activation and selectivity changes. Further use of molecular dynamics indicated that structural changes in the catalytic triad occur during imprinting, and that these changes may be the major factor that contributes to imprinting-induced substrate selectivity. This contrasts with the previously held notion that imprinting influences mainly substrate binding. "
"Theory predicts that cyanine dyes and related linear systems undergo symmetry collapse and bond localization at long chain lengths. Beyond this \xe2\x80\x9ccyanine limit\xe2\x80\x9d, the properties of these systems do not extrapolate from their shorter counterparts. To test this prediction, dipyridocyanines have been synthesized and shown to undergo such symmetry collapse with chain lengths as short as 13. "
"Recent reports from this laboratory have revealed that highly fluorinated 4- and 5-membered-ring enols are comparable in stability to, or more stable thermodynamically than, the corresponding ketones, even in non-Lewis-basic media. Work on perfluorinated keto\xe2\x88\x92enol systems has now been extended to 2H-perfluorocyclohexanone plus its enol and to a series of acyclic analogues. In carbon tetrachloride, KE/K = 0.33 (22 \xc2\xb0C) for the six-ring system, but only enol is detectable in Lewis-basic solvents. This shift is attributable to strong hydrogen-bond formation between the enol and Lewis base. A perfluoroenol has been shown to form significantly stronger hydrogen bonds than the potent hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol. Acyclic systems (e.g., 3H-perfluoro-2-butanone and its enol) contrast sharply with the cyclic, as no enol is detectable at equilibrium even in powerfully Lewis-basic media. Ab initio quantum mechanical calculations indicate that it is principally the enols, not the ketones, that are responsible for the difference between the two types of keto\xe2\x88\x92enol systems, i.e. acyclic perfluoroenols are strongly destabilized relative to cyclic counterparts. "
"The effects of perfluorination of cyclic and acyclic alkenes have been examined. Quantum mechanical calculations and experimental data show that vicinally substituted acyclic alkenes are strongly destabilized by fluorination. Quite surprisingly, the destabilization is much smaller for cyclic analogs. This difference has dramatic consequences for the relative stabilities of double bond isomers in cyclic and acyclic systems, including keto\xe2\x88\x92enol systems. The reasons for the contrast are discussed in detail. "
"The deuterium distribution observed in isobutane recovered after short contact times with the DF\xe2\x88\x92SbF5 superacid at 0 \xc2\xb0C shows that a very fast reversible protonation of all C\xe2\x88\x92H bonds occurs before ionization of the alkane, in accord with the Olah \xcf\x83-basicity concept. Comparison of the amounts of hydrogen with the amount of tert-butyl ions generated during ionization shows that the reaction is purely protolytic in HF containing up to 20 mol % SbF5, but becomes oxidative at higher concentrations.

"In the high-intensity laser-jet (LJ) photolysis of 9-(phenoxymethyl)anthracene (1a) and 9,10-bis(phenoxymethyl)anthracene (1b) multiple-photon chemistry was observed. Thus, while the [4 + 4] photodimer 8a was formed as the one-photon product in the low-intensity conventional photolysis of monoether 1a, the high-intensity irradiation in the laser-jet yielded 1,2-bis(9-anthracenyl)ethane (3a), lepidopterene (4a), biplanene (5a), 9-(chloromethyl)anthracene (6a), and 9-(methoxymethyl)anthracene (7a) as main products. The product distribution depended on the solvent used:\xe2\x80\x89 after C\xe2\x88\x92O homolysis of the ether 1a, for which at least two photons are required, the resulting arylmethyl radical 2a dimerizes in benzene, in methylene chloride it engages in photoinduced electron transfer, while in methanol it undergoes photoionization. With the help of time-resolved laser-flash photolysis of the monoether 1a it was confirmed that the homolysis of the C\xe2\x88\x92O bond leads to the 9-anthracenylmethyl radical 2a. The authentic radical 2a was generated independently by time-resolved pulse radiolysis and laser-flash photolysis of 9-(bromomethyl)anthracene. Analogous to the monoether 1a, the bisether 1b gave under the high intensity conditions of the laser-jet irradiation tetrabenzo[2.2]paracyclophane (3b), its photodimer (5b), 9,10-(bischloromethyl)anthracene (6b), and 9-(chloromethyl)-10-(phenoxymethyl)anthracene (9b); their distribution depended also on the solvent used. Mechanistic pathways are offered for these multiple-photon processes. "
"A range of tertiary amines was constructed using a \xe2\x80\x9ctraceless\xe2\x80\x9d linker on a polystyrene resin (REM resin), starting from secondary amines, primary amines, and resin-bound \xe2\x80\x9cammonia\xe2\x80\x9d. The methodology is characterized by three essential steps conducted under ambient conditions:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) coupling of the starting amine (Michael addition) to the resin, (2) activation (quaternization), and (3) cleavage of the product amine (Hofmann elimination). The linker is compatible with both acid and base sensitive protecting group strategies. The nature of the chemistry ensures that the tertiary amine products are obtained in consistently high purity (95% or greater). After cleavage of the product, REM resin is regenerated and can be reused for repeat syntheses. The yield and purity of repeat batches is maintained over 5 cycles, allowing the automated synthesis of >0.5 g quantities of pure tertiary amine. "
"Three approaches for the synthesis of dendrimers with poly(p-phenylene)-PPP derived cores are described. The respective limitations of these approaches are assessed in view of the goal of this research:\xe2\x80\x89 to make available structurally perfect, high molecular weight polymers with a dense sequence of sterically demanding dendrons.

"Iron salts catalyze the allylic amination of alkenes by arylhydroxylamines in moderate to good yields and with high regioselectivity resulting from double-bond transposition. The iron-catalyzed reaction of phenylhydroxylamine with representative alkenes in the presence of 2,3-dimethylbutadiene, an effective PhNO trap, produces allyl amines exclusively, excluding the intermediacy of free PhNO in the amination reaction. The reaction of FeCl2,3 with PhNO or PhNHOH produces a novel azo dioxide iron complex, {Fe[Ph(O)NN(O)Ph]3}[FeCl4]2 (1a), whose structure has been established by X-ray diffraction. The structure of 1a features essentially tetrahedral Fe(III)Cl4- anions and a novel six-coordinate dication having iron(II) bound through the oxygens of three azobenzene N,N-dioxide ligands. Evidence that 1a is the active aminating agent in the catalytic reactions includes (1) its isolation from the catalytic reaction; (2) its facile reaction with alkenes to produce allyl amine in high yield and regioselectivity; (3) its amination of alkenes without the intervention of free PhNO; and (4) its efficient catalysis of amination by PhNHOH. The reaction of 2-methyl-2-pentene (2-MP) with 1a (dioxane, 70 \xc2\xb0C) was examined kinetically; the appearance of allylamine was found to be first order in 1a and first order in alkene. Rate constants determined for the reactions of 1a with a set of para-substituted \xce\xb1-methylstyrenes lead to a Hammett \xcf\x81 value of \xe2\x88\x923.0. A small kinetic D-isotope effect, 1.4 \xc2\xb1 0.2, is found for the intermolecular amination of \xce\xb1-(trideuteriomethyl)styrene by 1a. Low-temperature reactions of 1a with 2-MP, \xce\xb2-methylstyrene, and styrene produce isolable alkene adducts 3a\xe2\x88\x92c. Thermolysis of 3a in dioxane gives the corresponding allyl amine while treatment of 3a\xe2\x88\x92c with nitrosoarenes regenerates the respective alkenes. IR, NMR, and UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectroscopic data also support the formulation of 3a\xe2\x88\x92c as alkene complexes. Evidence that azo dioxide complex 1 transfers a PhNO (rather than PhN) unit to alkene, producing an intermediate allylhydroxylamine which is subsequently reduced to the ultimate allyl amine, is provided from model reaction studies and GC/MS monitoring. Various mechanistic pathways are presented and analyzed. The mechanism most consistent with all of the accumulated evidence involves alkene coordination to 1 via dechelation of an azo dioxide ligand, intramolecular RNO transfer to coordinated alkene to produce the allylhydroxylamine, reductive deoxygenation of the allylhydroxylamine to allylamine, and regeneration of azo dioxide complex 1 by oxidation of another PhNHOH molecule by iron(III).

"The complexes (dppe)M{S2C2(2-quinoxaline)(R)}, where dppe = (diphenylphosphino)ethane, M = Ni, Pd, and Pt, and R = H and Me, have as their lowest-energy band an intraligand charge transfer transition (ILCT). Excitation of deaerated solutions of (dppe)Pt{S2C2(2-quinoxaline)(R)} lead to emissions from an 1ILCT* and an 3ILCT*. The lifetimes of these excited states (\xcf\x84) and the quantum yields for the emissions (\xcf\x86) for (dppe)Pt{S2C2(2-quinoxaline)(H)} in CH3CN are 1\xcf\x84 = 0.16 ns,1\xcf\x86 = 0.005 and 3\xcf\x84 = 3.3 \xce\xbcs, 3\xcf\x86 = 0.01, respectively. The 3ILCT* of these quinoxaline-substituted complexes can undergo a diverse suite of excited state reactions, including electron, proton, and hydrogen atom transfers. The second order rate constants (kq) for the quenching of the 3ILCT* emission by acids increases with the thermodynamic driving force for the excited state proton transfer, an observation consistent with excited state electron and hydrogen atom transfers. Dihydroquinone and p-methoxyphenol are substantially better quenching agents than excited state proton transfer would predict and thermodynamic calculations suggest that they quench the 3ILCT* by hydrogen atom transfer.

"A study of the redox behavior of the cobalt complex of octaethylbilindione (H3OEB), a biliverdin analog, reveals that coordination of the ligand allows its complexes to undergo reversible, one-electron transfer processes, whereas the free ligand itself undergoes an irreversible two-electron oxidation. Thus, the four-membered electron transfer series involving [Co(OEB)]n with n = +1, 0, \xe2\x88\x921, \xe2\x88\x922 has been observed electrochemically. The most highly oxidized member of this series has been isolated in the form of its triiodide salt, [CoII(OEBOx)]I3\xc2\xb70.5CH2Cl2, and characterized by X-ray diffraction. The structure involves helical coordination of the linear tetrapyrrole ligand about the cobalt with all four nitrogen atoms coordinated with Co\xe2\x88\x92N distances falling in the narrow range, 1.898(7)\xe2\x88\x921.926(7) \xc3\x85. The triiodide ion, which is disordered over three orientations, is ion paired to the complex. The Co\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7I distance (2.818 \xc3\x85 in the predominant orientation) is much longer than expected for a Co\xe2\x88\x92I covalent bond. In the solid state, pairs of [CoII(OEBOx)]I3 crystallize about a center of symmetry so that two identical tab/slot arrangements, which involve CH\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O hydrogen bonds, occur. These supramolecular arrangements involve hydrogen bonding between the lactam oxygen of one complex and methine and two methylene protons of an adjacent complex. Similar hydrogen bonded motifs are found in other complexes derived from octaethylbilindione and may occur for biliverdin IX derivatives as well. "
"A low-temperature (ca. 12 K) cubic (Pa3\xcc\x84) to orthorhombic (Pbca) phase transition of the \xce\xb2-alum CsTi(SO4)2\xc2\xb712H2O has been characterized by High Resolution Powder Neutron Diffraction and EPR measurements. Single crystal Raman spectra of the corresponding rubidium alum, RbTi(SO4)2\xc2\xb712H2O, show that a phase transition from the \xce\xb2-alum structure also occurs over the temperature range 5\xe2\x88\x9215 K, with the spectroscopic changes remarkably similar for the caesium and rubidium salts. The structural instability of the titanium(III) alums is not evident in the corresponding salts of larger or smaller tervalent cations and hence is interpreted in terms of the electronic structure of [Ti(OH2)6]3+. It is proposed that in the high-temperature cubic phase the S6 site symmetry lifts the degeneracy of the t2g (Oh) orbitals to leave the eg (S6) orbital set lowest lying. The resultant 2Eg (S6) ground term is subject to Jahn-Teller coupling with Eg phonon modes. The phase transition is interpreted as arising from a long-range interaction between the Jahn-Teller centers in the lattice giving rise to a cooperative Jahn-Teller effect. The proposed electronic structure of [Ti(OH2)6]3+ in CsTi(SO4)2\xc2\xb712H2O is consistent with the framework used to describe other tervalent aqua ions but is at variance with the current interpretationof 40 years standingwhich was based on the premise that the site symmetry of the tervalent cation is retained at all temperatures. The long-standing problem of the anomalous ground state g values of [Ti(OH2)6]3+ in CsTi(SO4)2\xc2\xb712H2O (g\xe2\x88\xa5 = 1.25 and g\xe2\x8a\xa5 = 1.14) is shown to arise as a consequence of the low symmetry distortion which results from a lowering of the site symmetry of [Ti(OH2)6]3+ from S6 (Pa3\xcc\x84) to Ci (Pbca).

"The formation of \xce\xb2-lactone through Lewis acid-promoted [2 + 2] cycloaddition is studied using semiempirical (AM1/RHF and AM1/CI) and ab initio (HF/6-31G* and MP2/6-31G*) calculations. After a preliminary semiempirical study of the BF3-catalyzed parent reaction through two distinct reaction paths, ab initio and/or semiempirical studies on solvent and Lewis acid (BH3 and BF3) effects concentrate on the mechanism involving the prior formation of the C\xe2\x88\x92C bond. At the HF/6-31G* level of theory the introduction of BF3 induces a reduction of the activation energy from 40.8 to 11.9 kcal/mol, and calculations performed with AM1/COSMO showed that the introduction of a solvent results in the formation of an earlier transition state. The case of BH3 is somehow more complicated since the studied system induces, both at the semiempirical and ab initio levels, a hydride transfer leading to a very stable product. "
"Recent density functionals and a variety of basis sets were employed in the study of three electronic states of the succinimidyl radical in C2v symmetry:\xe2\x80\x89 2A1 (\xcf\x83N), 2B1 (\xcf\x80N), and 2B2 (\xcf\x83O). The lowest energy \xcf\x83O state is a genuine (local) minimum, as demonstrated by the harmonic vibrational analysis; the stationary points corresponding to the two remaining states are higher-order saddle points on the potential energy surface. Similar results were obtained with the M\xc3\xb8ller\xe2\x88\x92Plesset method, while the complete active space calculations predict that the \xcf\x80N state has the lowest total energy. The ring-opening reaction from the \xcf\x83O state is symmetry allowed and was calculated with the density functional theory to proceed via a true transition state. The \xce\xb2-scission process was found to exhibit a large secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effect, with kH/kD = 1.2. The infrared spectra of the open forms of the radical that result from \xce\xb2-scission reaction were calculated and compared to the calculated spectrum of \xce\xb2-bromopropanoyl isocyanate. "
"In an attempt to understand the dramatic difference in reactivity between phenylnitrene (1a) and pentafluorophenylnitrene (1b), the ring expansion reactions of several fluorinated arylnitrenes have been studied computationally at the CASPT2N/cc-pVDZ//CASSCF(8,8)/6-31G* + ZPE level of theory. The nitrenes considered include 2,6-difluorophenylnitrene (1c), 3,5-difluorophenylnitrene (1d), 4-fluorophenylnitrene (1e), and 2-fluorophenylnitrene (1f). In all cases ring expansion of the open-shell singlet nitrenes (1) to the ketenimines (3) was calculated to occur via the same two-step mechanism as that predicted for the parent system (1a), with the first stepcyclization to the azirines (2)being rate-determining. The calculated barrier of 13.4 kcal/mol for cyclization of 1c is 3.5\xe2\x88\x924.5 kcal/mol higher than the corresponding barriers for nitrenes 1e and 1f, and for 1a. For nitrene 1f, the calculated barrier of 13.0 kcal/mol for cyclization toward fluorine is 3 kcal/mol higher than the barrier for cyclization away from fluorine. These calculated differences in barrier heights are consistent with known experimnental data for nitrenes 1a\xe2\x88\x92f and are attributed largely to steric repulsion in the transition state when the nitrogen atom cyclizes toward fluorine. This steric explanation is based on an analysis of the optimized geometries of the transition states and is supported by calculations on the cyclization reactions of 2-chlorophenylnitrene (1h) and 2-methylphenylnitrene (1j).

"The infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) of the two isomers, M(1,3-butadiene)+ and M(C2H2)(C2H4)+ (M = Fe, Co, or Ni), was investigated. For the butadiene system, FeC4H6+ was observed to give three products, CoC4H6+ four products, and NiC4H6+ only one product. The observation of four products has not been previously seen in IRMPD studies of ions and suggests a fortuitous balance of several factors. Interestingly, the IRMPD of M(butadiene-1,1,4,4-d4)+ was observed not only to give one product for M = Fe, Co, or Ni but also to proceed with a decreased photodissociation rate. For the M(C2H2)(C2H4)+ system, IRMPD suggests that D\xc2\xb0(Co+\xe2\x88\x92C2H2) \xe2\x88\xbc D\xc2\xb0(Co+\xe2\x88\x92C2H4). Also, SORI and/or competitive CID indicate that D\xc2\xb0(M+\xe2\x88\x92C2H2) > D\xc2\xb0(M+\xe2\x88\x92C2H4) by 0.5\xe2\x88\x922 kcal/mol for M = Fe or Ni. On the basis of these observations, we assign D\xc2\xb0(Fe+\xe2\x88\x92C2H2) = 36 \xc2\xb1 2 kcal/mol, D\xc2\xb0(Co+\xe2\x88\x92C2H2) = 43 \xc2\xb1 2 kcal/mol, and D\xc2\xb0(Ni+\xe2\x88\x92C2H2) = 45 \xc2\xb1 2 kcal/mol. These results are compared to recent theoretical and experimental findings. "
We report photorefractivity in nematic liquid crystals doped with electron donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor molecules that undergo intramolecular photoinduced charge separation. We show that subsequent intermolecular electron transfer from the intramolecular ion pairs to neutral donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor molecules is responsible for the charge migration over macroscopic distances that is required to produce photorefractivity. The results are compared to nematic liquid crystals doped with identical unlinked donors and acceptors that can achieve charge separation only through intermolecular electron transfer. We find that the liquid crystals doped with molecules that first undergo intramolecular charge separation exhibit superior photorefractivity when compared to the same liquid crystals doped with unlinked donors and acceptors. The differing mechanisms for charge generation and charge transport in these liquid crystal composites are analyzed. 
"The electronic structure of donor/acceptor polyenes (merocyanines) is studied by means of electroabsorption (Stark) spectroscopy. Molecules belonging to this class exhibit an extreme variability of their linear and nonlinear optical properties. Depending on the nature of the donor and acceptor end groups and the polarity of their solvent environment they can adopt ground state molecular structures between limits with mostly localized double bonds (polyene-like) or fully delocalized double bonds (cyanine-like). By comparing the results obtained for the change in dipole moment, \xce\x94\xce\xbc, and change in polarizability, \xce\x94\xce\xb1, upon optical excitation of 12 donor/acceptor polyenes with theoretical predictions, each molecule\'s location in between these limits can be assigned. The results demonstrate that this position can be understood by considering only the relative electron donating and accepting strengths of the end groups. The solvent dependence of the electronic structure is also studied by measuring Stark spectra for two compounds in different frozen solvents. The results are consistent with a change of the molecule\'s ground state toward more dipolar structures in polar solvents. Taken together, the donor, acceptor, and solvent dependences of the electronic structure of donor/acceptor polyenes can be described by a simple model based on the gradual change of the molecule\xe2\x80\x99s ground state between polyene-like and cyanine-like structures.

"The one-pot double deoxygenation of simple alkyl- and polyether-tethered aromatic dialdehydes to give macrocyclic allenes has been accomplished in extraordinarily high yield without the need for slow-addition techniques, using a Ti(IV)-substituted ylide reagent and bis(trimethylsilyl)amide bases. Diastereoselective allene formation occurs when a binaphthyl unit is present in the substrate backbone, and the resulting cyclic allene is characterized by X-ray diffraction. Highly efficient cyclization is proposed to be the result of a combination of preorganization about the amide base counterion and a low concentration of the immediate precursor to Wittig-style olefination ring closure.

"In this contribution we demonstrate that Bizelesin can translocate along the minor groove of DNA from a kinetically favored monoalkylation site to a thermodynamically favored cross-linking site. This translocation is prevented in compounds that have a charged guanidino linkage substituting for the ureadiyl linkage. Furthermore, the manipulative interplay of Bizelesin and the target sequence 5\xe2\x80\x98-TAATTA (Seaman, F. C.; Chu, J.; Hurley, L. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 5383\xe2\x88\x925395) that is required to produce a suitably rearranged product for cross-linking is prevented by the substitution of a guanidino for the ureadiyl linkage. A structural basis involving hydrogen bonding of the guanidino linkage with phosphates on the backbone of DNA is proposed to account for the absence of translocation, the slow conversion of monoalkylated to cross-linked species, and the non-rearranged cross-linked product.

"The design, synthesis, and characterization of a family of peptides modeled after the zinc finger domains, which has led to the production of a fluorescent peptidyl sensor for divalent zinc with enhanced oxidative stability, are reported. The chemosensor design comprises a synthetic peptidyl template and a covalently attached fluorescent reporter which is sensitive to metal-induced conformational changes in the polypeptide construct. The modular synthetic approach employed for the construction of these chemosensors allows independent modification of the metal coordination sphere and the fluorescent reporter group. The structural, fluorescence, and zinc binding properties of these peptides and the effects of integrating various environment sensitive fluorophores, 4-(dimethylamino)benzamide, 5-(dimethylamino)naphthalenesulfonamide, and 3-carboxamidocoumarin, are described. Manipulation of the ligand sphere, by removal of one of the pair of thiolate ligands, was undertaken to enhance the oxidative stability of the chemosensor. For each of these peptides, the apparent dissociation constant of the peptide\xe2\x88\x92zinc complex has been determined by spectroscopic methods. High-affinity binding, with dissociation constants ranging from 7 pM to 65 nM, is observed. "
"Adducts of the zwitterionic (ZW) form of merocyanine (MC) of five photochromic spirooxazines (SO) and spiropyrans (SP) have, for the first time, been prepared photochemically or thermally through a trapping reaction of metastable MC with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) in dichloromethane. The adducts (ZWAs) form easily and are obtained in almost quantitative yields. X-ray diffraction analysis of ZWA of spirooxazine 2 shows that in the adduct the planes of the indolyl and naphthyl moieties form a ca. 29\xc2\xb0 angle. The adduct crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n with a = 22.663(4) \xc3\x85, b = 8.234(1) \xc3\x85, c = 14.455(2) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 104.72(1)\xc2\xb0, V = 2637.4(7) \xc3\x853, and Dcalcd = 1.1476 Mg/m3 for Z = 4. Least-squares refinement of the model based on 1986 reflections (F > 4\xcf\x83(F)) converged to a final R = 0.066 and Rw = 0.068. ZWAs form through an unprecedented, clean, and regioselective Michael-type 1,6-addition of TMSCN to either a strongly polarized quinoidal MC form or its charge-separated zwitterionic limit structure. No evidence for the more common 1,2- and/or 1,4-addition has been found. The observed high reactivity of SOs and SPs with nucleophiles may contribute to the reported limited durability of these classes of photochromes. "
"A benzothiazolium styryl azacrown ether dye (1) and its complexation with Ba2+ and Na+ cations in acetonitrile solution have been studied by UV-vis absorption and emission spectroscopy. trans-1 is found to act as a normal chromoionophore for Ba2+ and Na+ at high concentration (\xe2\x89\xa510-2 M) by complexation with the azacrown and as a light-controlled, transient chromoionophore specific for Ba2+ at low concentration (10-5\xe2\x88\x9210-3 M). A quantitative analysis of the complexation and thermal reactions following photolysis has enabled a detailed mechanism to be proposed:\xe2\x80\x89 trans-1 photoisomerization produces cis-1, which is stabilized in the presence of Ba2+ by dual intramolecular complexation of the cation with both azacrown and sulfonate groups.

"A general total synthesis of mycobactins, represented by a mycobactin S, was achieved by a convergent approach. Two hydroxamic acid residues, 28 and 40b, were prepared from commercially available N\xce\xb1-Cbz-l-lysine via dimethyldioxirane oxidations. Cyclization of hydroxylamine 34 to a seven-membered hydroxamic acid, 35, was mediated by DCC, DMAP, and DMAP\xc2\xb7HCl. The use of a [2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methyl group as a hydroxyl protecting group for N\xce\xb1-Cbz-N\xce\xb5-hydroxy-N\xce\xb5-palmitoyl-l-lysine methyl ester (28) was critical for this synthesis. Biological tests indicated that the synthetic mycobactin S was a potent growth inhibitor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, though it differs in only one stereogenic center from mycobactin T, the siderophore growth promoter of M. tuberculosis.

"This work examines the influence of ions in solution on electroosmosis inside a fused silica capillary using capillary electrophoresis; it thereby examines \xe2\x80\x9cshielding\xe2\x80\x9d at charged interfaces. Theories are reviewed that model ionic solutions as continuous dielectrics:\xe2\x80\x89 the nonlinear form of the Poisson\xe2\x88\x92Boltzmann equation gives rise to the simplified, more commonly used Debye\xe2\x88\x92H\xc3\xbcckel (DH) equation. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is used to measure the rate of electroosmotic flow as a function of the concentration of different monovalent and divalent cations in aqueous solution. These data are used to test three specific predictions of DH theory:\xe2\x80\x89 this theory does not describe these data adequately. The central reason behind the inadequacy of DH theory here is its inability to account for details at the level of individual ions other than by mean-field electrostatics:\xe2\x80\x89 that is, chemical characteristics of ionsfor example, polarizability, hydrated size, energy of hydration, ability to coordinate other ions by chelationare not accounted for. A model (the \xe2\x80\x9cdissociation model\xe2\x80\x9d) is described that treats the interactions between cations in solution and negatively charged groups on a surface in terms of discrete association equilibria with characteristic dissociation constants, Kdeff. CE is then used as a tool to measure values of Kdeff for different cations. These dissociation constants follow patterns that are consistent with ones that are familiar from studies in solution. "
"Single-crystal neutron diffraction analyses of 2- and 3-aminophenols have been performed. In addition to O\xe2\x88\x92H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N and N\xe2\x88\x92H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O hydrogen bonds, both these structures contain previously unidentified N\xe2\x88\x92H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xcf\x80 and C\xe2\x88\x92H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O hydrogen bonds. This unusual mutual recognition pattern is not found in 4-aminophenol and other related systems. Its presence hints that the optimization of the herringbone interactions, rather than the formation of N\xe2\x88\x92H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O hydrogen bonds, is the primary packing effect in these compounds. Our observations on these simple isomeric aminophenols indicate that it may not always be realistic to expect straightforward correspondences between molecular and crystal structure. The definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9csupramolecular synthon\xe2\x80\x9d recognizes this inadequacy and attempts to provide a more reliable basis for the description of crystal structures. "
"A series of myoglobin active site analogues (1\xe2\x88\x926) has been synthesized and characterized. These synthetic models differ in their cavity dimensions, and have been designed to demonstrate the effects of steric factors on O2 and CO binding affinities. Quantitative gas titrations were employed to measure these affinities, yielding M values that are strikingly lower than those reported for hemoglobin and myoglobin. The 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-capped porphyrin 1 has about 1200 times the CO affinity but only about 10 times the O2 affinity of the cyclam-capped porphyrin 2, suggesting a more open gas binding cavity for 1. The cavity dimensions and conformation of 2 were determined by single-crystal X-ray structural analysis of the Zn analogue 7. This paper unequivocally demonstrates that steric effects can control the ratio of O2/CO binding constants. "
"The sodium amalgam (2 Na per M) reduction of hydrocarbon solutions of the chloro, aryl oxide compounds [M(OC6H3Pri2-2,6)2Cl3]2 (1) and [M(OC6H3Pri2-2,6)3Cl2] (2) (a, M = Nb; b, M = Ta) in the presence of 1,3-cyclohexadiene leads to formation of the \xce\xb74-cyclohexadiene derivatives [M(OC6H3Pri2-2,6)2Cl(\xce\xb74-C6H8)] (3) and [M(OC6H3Pri2-2,6)3(\xce\xb74-C6H8)] (4). Spectroscopic studies of compounds 3 and 4 show in all cases a strongly bound cyclohexadiene ligand which does not readily undergo displacement (NMR) with added reagents such as PMe2Ph and cyclohexene. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses of 3a and the isomorphous pair 4a and 4b show in all three cases a geometry about the metal center best described as three-legged piano stool. Compound 4a will catalyze the disproportionation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene into cyclohexene and benzene as well as the hydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene into cyclohexane. Mechanistic studies clearly show that cyclohexene is not released during the conversion of 1,3-cyclohexadiene to cyclohexane catalyzed by 4a. In contrast, solutions of 3a will convert 1,3-cyclohexadiene slowly to cyclohexene prior to conversion to cyclohexane. The addition of 1,3-cyclohexadiene to the trihydride compounds [Ta(OC6H3Cy2-2,6)2(H)3(PMe2Ph)2] and [Ta(OC6HPh2-3,5-Cy2-2,6)2(H)3(PMe2Ph)2] leads to the interesting products [Ta(OC6H3Cy2-2,6)2(\xce\xb71-C6H10-\xce\xb74-C6H7)] (5) and [Ta(OC6HPh2-3,5-Cy2-2,6)2(\xce\xb71-C6H10-\xce\xb74-C6H7)] (6) which, based upon structural studies of 5 contain a partially hydrogenated non-Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder dimer of 1,3-cyclohexadiene. The addition of 1,3-cyclohexadiene to the dihydride compounds [Ta(OC6H3Pri2-2,6)2(Cl)(H)2(PMe2Ph)2] and [Ta(OC6H3But2-2,6)2(Cl)(H)2(PMe2Ph)] leads to the dehydrogenation product [Ta(OC6H3Pri-\xce\xb72-CMeCH2)(OC6H3Pri2-2,6)(Cl)(PMe2Ph)2] (7) and the cyclohexyl compound [Ta(OC6H3But-CMe2CH2)(OC6H3But2-2,6)(Cl)(C6H11)] (8), respectively.

"This paper is devoted to the determination of the spin density in the ferrimagnetic ground state of the bimetallic chain compound MnCu(pba)(H2O)3\xc2\xb72H2O, with pba = 1,3-propylenebis(oxamato). The crystal structure, previously determined at room temperature through X-ray diffraction, was redetermined at 10 K through unpolarized neutron diffraction (orthorhombic system, space group Pnma, a = 12.727(11) \xc3\x85, b = 21.352(19) \xc3\x85, c = 5.153(3) \xc3\x85, Z = 4). The experimental spin density has been deduced from polarized neutron diffraction data recorded at 10 K under 50 kOe. Positive spin densities were observed on the manganese side and negative spin densities on the copper side. The delocalization of the spin density from the metal centers toward the oxamato bridging ligand was found to be more pronounced on the copper side than on the manganese side, so that the nodal surface (of zero spin density) is closer to manganese than to copper. The experimental spin distribution has been compared to the theoretical distributions deduced from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, using both DGauss and DMol programs. The experimental results for the title chain compound have also been compared to the spin distribution for the binuclear compound [Mn(Me6-[14]ane-N4)Cu(oxpn)](CF3SO3)2 with Me6-[14]ane-N4 = (\xc2\xb1)-5,7,7,12,14,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane, and oxpn = N,N\xe2\x80\x98-bis(3-aminopropyl)oxamido, recently reported. The most striking difference between pair and chain compounds concerns the positive P+ and negative P- spin populations carried by the manganese and copper sides, respectively. For the pair compound P+ was found as 4.67(8) \xce\xbcB, and P- as \xe2\x88\x920.67(8) \xce\xbcB while for the chain compound these values are 5.05(7) \xce\xbcB and \xe2\x88\x921.05(10) \xce\xbcB, respectively. The spin distribution for the ferrimagnetic chain compound is very close to a Neel state (P+ = 5 \xce\xbcB and P- = \xe2\x88\x921 \xce\xbcB). "
"The title compound proves to be an effective and efficient catalyst for the Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reaction when the dienophile is an \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated ketone or aldehyde. It is especially effective in water. Equal amounts of any such dienophile and any of six representative dienes (isoprene, 2-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, cyclopentadiene, 1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene, and 1,3-cyclohexadiene) were used, along with 1% MTO. The reactions gave usually >90% isolated yield of the cycloaddition product except for the larger dienophiles. Nearly exclusively, there was formed one product isomer, the same one that usually predominates. The reactions were often run in chloroform (mostly) and in other organic solvents. A select number were carried out in water, where the reactions gave a greater product yield in a considerably shorter time. Water, itself, is known to enhance the rates of Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reactions, but MTO exerts an additional accelerating effect. Kinetics studies were carried out to show that the rate is proportional to the catalyst concentration. The products do not inhibit the reaction. The desirability of MTO as a Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder catalyst stems from a combination of favorable properties:\xe2\x80\x89 the inertness to air/oxygen, the tolerance for many substrates, the use of an aqueous medium, and the absence of product inhibition. The initial step appears to be the (weak) coordination of the carbonyl oxygen to the electropositive rhenium center. Steric crowding around rhenium inhibits reactions of the larger dienophiles. "
"Several anionic and paramagnetic [CpCr(NO)X2]- complexes (X = I [1], O3SCF3 (OTf) [2], Br [3], Cl [4]) have been prepared as potential precursors to neutral CpCr(NO)X2 species. Reaction of [CpCr(NO)I]2 with [NBu4]I provides [NBu4][1], and halide abstraction from [NBu4][1] with 2 equiv of AgOTf affords [NBu4][2]. The weakly-bound OTf- ligands of [NBu4][2] are readily displaced by Br- to produce [NBu4][3]. The dichloro complexes [NEt4][4] and [PPN][4] are obtained by treating [CpCr(NO)Cl]2 with [NEt4]Cl and [PPN]Cl, respectively. Use of acetonitrile as reaction solvent allows generation of the requisite [CpCr(NO)Cl]2 directly from CpCr(NO)(CO)2 and PCl5, a marked improvement over previous synthetic routes to this dimer. Similar halogenations of Cp*Cr(NO)(CO)2 in NCMe provide access to the previously unknown [Cp*Cr(NO)I]2 (5), and [Cp*Cr(NO)Cl]2 (6), halo-bridged, and dimers. The solid-state molecular structure of [PPN][4]\xc2\xb7CH2Cl2 has been established by single-crystal X-ray crystallography to be a normal three-legged piano stool. The one-electron oxidation of [4] has been investigated both chemically (by reaction with [Cp2Fe]+) and electrochemically (by cyclic voltammetry). These studies suggest that upon oxidation a high-spin CpCr(NO)Cl2 complex is initially formed which then rapidly releases NO. Extended H\xc3\xbcckel molecular-orbital calculations have been performed on [4], [CpCr(CO)3]-, and [CpCrCl3]-, three CpCr-containing anions with ligands of varying \xcf\x80-bonding capabilities. Correlations between their orbital energies and electron occupancies and a rationale for the lability of the NO ligand in neutral CpCr(NO)Cl2 are provided. "
"Reaction of either (n-Bu4N)2[Mo5O13(OMe)4(NO){Na(MeOH)}]\xc2\xb7xMeOH or (n-Bu4N)3[Mo6O18(NO)] with various reducing agents, including N2H4\xc2\xb72HCl, in methanol or in a mixture of methanol and acetonitrile, yields reduced nitrosyl decamolybdates, among which (n-Bu4N)[Mo10O25(OMe)6(NO)] ((n-Bu4N)II) and two forms of (n-Bu4N)2[Mo10O24(OMe)7(NO)] ((n-Bu4N)2IVa and (n-Bu4N)2IVb) have been crystallographically characterized. IVa,b are diastereoisomers that differ in the location of methoxo groups. The molecular structures of II and IV are closely related to that of [W10O32]4-, the so-called decatungstate Y, and consist of two halves of five edge-sharing octahedra connected through four quasi-linear Mo\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92Mo bridges. Besides the four electrons essentially residing at the Mo(II) center bearing the nitrosyl ligand, II and IV further accommodate two and four delocalized \xe2\x80\x9cblue\xe2\x80\x9d electrons, respectively. II and IV thus contain molybdenum atoms in three different oxidation states, Mo(II), Mo(V), and Mo(VI). On the basis of their optical spectra, they are best described as class II mixed-valence complexes according to the classification of Robin and Day. Their intimate electronic structure has been further investigated by means of extended H\xc3\xbcckel calculations on the model compound [Mo10O26(OH)6]. The composition of the HOMO clearly demonstrates that the \xe2\x80\x9cblue\xe2\x80\x9d electrons are circulating among the eight equatorial molybdenum sites, the delocalization being strongly favored by the quasi-linear M\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92Mo bridges.

"The reduction of rhodium(III) porphyrins in polar aprotic solvents is a two-electron irreversible reaction yielding directly the Rh(I) complex. The cause of this irreversibility is not the metal\xe2\x88\x92metal dimerization of the initially formed Rh(II) complex as believed earlier but rather deligation which generates a secondary Rh(II) species easier to reduce than the starting Rh(III) porphyrin. This is confirmed by the fact that sterically encumbered porphyrins, such as those bearing cross-trans basket-handle superstructures which forbid the approach of two molecules at bonding distance, exhibit the same behavior as simple rhodium porphyrins. The occurrence of such an ECE\xe2\x88\x92disproportionation process, seldom observed in the redox chemistry of metallo-porphyrins or similar complexes, is probably related to the tendency of the rhodium atom to shift out of the porphyrin plane, particularly at the Rh(I) oxidation state. It is remarkable that strong and soft ligands, e.g., tertiary phosphines, annihilate the disproportionation of the rhodium(II) complex. "
"Black Pt effected the hydrogenation of Ru(COD)(\xce\xb73-C3H5)2 (1; COD is 1,5-cyclooctadiene) by dihydrogen gas (pressure \xe2\x88\xbc1 atm) at \xe2\x88\x9210 \xc2\xb0C in hexanes. The hydrogenation resulted in adsorption of Ru adatoms by the surface of Pt with concomitant formation of propane, cyclooctane, and small amounts of cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane and n-octane. Compound 1 did not react with dihydrogen gas under these conditions in the absence of Pt. The total amount of cyclooctane, bicyclo[3.3.0]octane, and n-octane in solution was equal to the amount of 1 consumed at all stages of the hydrogenation. The lifetimes of the organic fragments on the surface were short on the time scale of the hydrogenation. It was therefore possible to observe in real time both the stoichiometry and the activity of the evolving Ru\xe2\x88\x92Pt surface by monitoring the concentrations of either 1 or the C8 product hydrocarbons in solution. There was a kinetic burst during the initial stages of the hydrogenation that ended after deposition of 0.2\xe2\x88\x920.5 equiv of Ru versus Ptsurface (Ptsurface is an active site on black Pt). The rate decreased after the burst and then increased as more Ru was deposited on Pt to reach a maximum, constant rate after deposition of 1.5\xe2\x88\x921.8 equiv of Ru. Cyclic voltammograms recorded in 1.0 M H2SO4 of the bare surface, of the surface after adsorption of a monolayer of carbon monoxide, and of the surface in the presence of methanol showed that coverage of Pt by Ru was essentially complete after the maximum, constant rate was achieved during hydrogenation of 1. The surface area of a Ru surface resulting from hydrogenation of 2.7 equiv of 1 was 67% that of the original Pt surface according to the charge associated with oxidation of an adsorbed monolayer of carbon monoxide. Anodic stripping of Ru showed that the total of C8 hydrocarbon products in solution after hydrogenation of 1 equaled the amount of Ru deposited on Pt. A catalyst surface resulting from hydrogenation of 0.11 equiv of 1 was up to \xe2\x88\xbc14 times more active than bare Pt for the potentiodynamic oxidation of methanol ([MeOH] = 1.0 M, [H2SO4] = 0.5 M, 40 \xc2\xb0C, sweep rate 5 mV/s). A catalyst surface resulting from hydrogenation of 0.33 equiv of 1 oxidized methanol potentiostatically at 0.158 V (vs SCE, [MeOH] = 0.5 M, [H2SO4] = 0.5 M, 25 \xc2\xb0C) for 45 min with \xe2\x88\xbc13 times the activity of Pt under the same conditions. A catalyst surface resulting from deposition of 0.8 equiv of Ru oxidized methanol potentiostatically at 0.256 V (vs SCE) under the above conditions for a total of 1.5 h with negligible dissolution of Ru into the electrolyte.

"For the first time [3 + 2] 1,3-cycloaddition of an ionized carbonyl ylide has been observed in gas phase ion\xe2\x88\x92molecule reactions of +CH2OCH2\xe2\x80\xa2 (1) with several carbonyl compounds. The reaction, which competes with electrophilic addition that leads to net CH2\xe2\x80\xa2+ transfer, occurs across the CO double bond of acetaldehyde and several acyclic ketones yielding ionized 4,4-dialkyl-1,3-dioxolanes as unstable cycloadducts. Rapid dissociation of the nascent cycloadducts by loss of a 4-alkyl substituent as a radical leads to the observed products, that is cyclic 4-alkyl-1,3-dioxolanylium ions. Cycloaddition of 1 with cyclic ketones yields bicyclic spiro adducts, which also undergo rapid dissociation. Cyclobutanone yields ionized 1,3-dioxaspiro[4,3]octane, which dissociates exclusively by neutral ethene loss to ionized 4-methylene-1,3-dioxolane. Ionized 1,3-dioxaspiro[4,4]nonane is formed in reactions with cyclopentanone, and its rapid dissociation by loss of C3H6 and C2H5\xe2\x80\xa2 yields the ionized 4-methylene-1,3-dioxolanylium and the 4-ethenyl-1,3-dioxolanylium product ions, respectively. A systematic study of this novel reaction and characterization of the product ions carried out via pentaquadrupole (QqQqQ) multiple stage (MS2 and MS3) mass spectrometric experiments provide experimental evidence for the cycloaddition mechanism. The dissociation chemistry observed for the cycloaddition products correlate well with their proposed structures and was compared to that of both isomeric and reference ions. Ab initio MP2/6-31G(d,p)//HF/6-31G(d,p) + ZPE potential energy surface diagrams for the reactions of 1 with acetone, fluoroacetone, and 1,1,1-trifluoroacetone support the operation of the two competitive reaction pathways, that is CH2\xe2\x80\xa2+ transfer and [3 + 2] 1,3-cycloaddition/dissociation, and show that the cycloaddition process is favored by electron-withdrawing substituents.

"The conformations of cytochrome c ions (+8 through +18) in the gas phase are examined by simultaneous ion-mobility and hydrogen\xe2\x88\x92deuterium exchange measurements. By varying the voltage used to inject ions into the drift tube it is possible to study H/D exchange of specific conformers observed in the ion-mobility spectra:\xe2\x80\x89 either very diffuse structures that are favored for all charge states at high injection voltages or compact structures that can be favored for the +8, +9, and +10 charge states at low voltages. The number of exchangeable hydrogens for the diffuse conformer is independent of charge state, with an average value that is quite low:\xe2\x80\x89 only 63 \xc2\xb1 2 of a possible 198. The compact conformers observed for the +8 through +10 charge states exchange fewer hydrogens (\xe2\x88\xbc46), consistent with the idea that compact structures protect some hydrogens in the gas phase. Many sites that rapidly exchange in solution appear to be restricted for exchange in the gas phase, even for very open conformers. "
"The molecular structure of N,N-dimethylactamide, (CH3)2NC(O)CH3, was determined by gas electron diffraction (GED). A rigid model results in a vibrationally averaged structure with nonplanar configuration at nitrogen and with the sum of the nitrogen bond angles \xe2\x88\x91\xce\xb1N = 354.1(17)\xc2\xb0. The GED intensities can be fitted equally well with a dynamic model with either a quartic potential (planar equilibrium structure) or a very flat double-minimum potential (pseudoplanar structure) for the out-of-plane motion. Theoretical calculations predict either planar (HF/3-21G and B3PW91/6-311G(2d)) or slightly nonplanar equilibrium structures (HF/3-21G(*), MP2/6-31G*, and MP2/6-311G*). The following skeletal parameters (uncertainties are 3\xcf\x83 values) were derived from the GED analysis:\xe2\x80\x89 C1O = 1.226(3) \xc3\x85, C1\xe2\x88\x92C2 = 1.527(6) \xc3\x85, N\xe2\x88\x92C1 = 1.368(5) \xc3\x85, N\xe2\x88\x92C3 = N\xe2\x88\x92C4 = 1.453(3) \xc3\x85, N\xe2\x88\x92C1=O = 121.0(7)\xc2\xb0, N\xe2\x88\x92C1\xe2\x88\x92C2 = 115.9(9)\xc2\xb0, C1\xe2\x88\x92N\xe2\x88\x92C3 = 123.8(13)\xc2\xb0, C1\xe2\x88\x92N\xe2\x88\x92C4 = 117.8(11)\xc2\xb0 (C3 and C4 are anti and syn to oxygen, respectively, and the N\xe2\x88\x92C3 and N\xe2\x88\x92C4 bond lengths were assumed to be equal).

"While exo-exo-[1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)allyl]lithium (15) and [1-(trimethylsilyl)allyl]lithium (16) were previously shown to be contact ion pairs containing delocalized carbanions, the corresponding species with a pendant ligand at the 2-position, [2-[[bis(2-methoxyethyl)amino]methyl]-1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)allyl]lithium (14) and [2-[[bis(2-methoxyethyl)amino]methyl]-1-(trimethylsilyl)allyl]lithium (12), respectively, appear from their 13C NMR shifts and the first observation of 13C lithium spin coupling in an allylic lithium to be partially delocalized with detectable C\xe2\x88\x92Li covalence. In proposed structures 12 and 14, lithium is tridentately complexed. N and Li lie within the allyl carbon plane with the two oxygens normal to it on opposite sides. NMR line shape analysis and 13C1 of signal averaging of the 13C\xe2\x88\x926Li coupling of 12 provides dynamics of intermolecular C\xe2\x88\x92Li bond exchange with \xce\x94He\xe2\xa7\xa7 and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 of 11.6 kcal/mol and \xe2\x88\x9211.5 eu, respectively. Inversion at the lithium-bound carbon of 12 averages nonequivalent ligand shifts. Line shape analysis gives \xce\x94Hi\xe2\xa7\xa7 and \xce\x94Si\xe2\xa7\xa7 of 8 kcal/mol and \xe2\x88\x9210 eu, respectively. Line shape changes observed for the methylsilyl (13C and 1H) resonances as well as of the terminal 13C\'s of 14 due to a 1,3 Li sigmatropic shift yield activation parameters \xce\x94Hs\xe2\xa7\xa7 and \xce\x94Ss\xe2\xa7\xa7 of 18 kcal/mol and +15 eu. These results show that electronic structure of nominally conjugated organolithium compounds can be significantly altered by changing the stereochemistry of solvation, by use of pendant ligands, producing structures previously described in other systems as transition states for allylic rotation.

"We report the first confirmed fluorescence lifetime measurement for a diazirine. We have obtained time-correlated single-photon counting fluorescence decays for adamantyldiazirine in a variety of solvents, over a wide range of temperatures (77\xe2\x88\x92320 K) and across the diazirine absorption band (330\xe2\x88\x92371 nm). The fluorescence lifetime of the primary decay component is on the order of 240 ps at ambient temperature and increases at lower temperatures. Arrhenius treatment of the fluorescence lifetime data indicates that the rate-limiting barrier for activated processes in the diazirine excited state is between 2.7 and 2.9 kcal/mol. Adamantyldiazirine\'s fluorescence lifetime appears to be unaffected by deuteration of the solvent, solvent polarity, or excitation energy. We also report and discuss the steady-state absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of adamantyldiazirine in a variety of solvents, as well as the infrared spectrum (KBr). We interpret the spectra with the help of ab initio (RHF/6-31G* and CIS/6-31G*), density functional (B3LYP/6-31G*), and semiempirical (PM3) calculations. The fluorescence quantum yield of adamantyldiazirine at ambient temperature was calculated to be \xe2\x88\xbc0.0012. Analysis of our data in the light of previous research leads us to conclude that little or no intermolecular chemistry is attributable to photoexcited adamantyldiazirine in solution at ambient temperature. Rather, fluorescence competes with one or more intramolecular photochemical processes. "
"The distribution of negatively charged colloidal particles near a like-charged glass plate was investigated using a confocal laser scanning microscope and video imagery. It was found that the number of particles about 5 \xce\xbcm from the glass surface was higher than that inside the dispersion and decreased gradually with distance. At shorter distances, such as 1 \xce\xbcm, there were no particles due to an electrostatic repulsion between the glass plate and the particles. The \xe2\x80\x9ccondensation\xe2\x80\x9d near the glass surface was observed at low ionic strengths in the dispersion, such as NaCl concentrations of 10-5 M or lower, and the peak in the particle distribution profile as a function of distance from the glass surface disappeared at 10-4 M. The peak height increased with the number of surface charges on the particles and with the surface \xce\xb6-potential of the plate. The greater the number of charges on the plate and particles, the more pronounced became the condensation. The dependencies of the peak height indicated that the driving force for the condensation was an electrostatic attractive interaction between the like-charged plate and particles, though such an interaction is not predicted by the conventional DLVO theory.

"Multinuclear (2H, 13C, 29Si, 81Br) magnetic resonance spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, and polarized optical microscopy techniques have been used to investigate molecular and mesoscopic organization in silicate\xe2\x88\x92surfactant lyotropic liquid crystals with hexagonal and lamellar morphologies under highly alkaline conditions. Such systems cooperatively self-assemble following the addition of a basic aqueous solution containing anionic silicate oligomers (e.g., double-four-ring species) to an isotropic micellar solution of cationic surfactant molecules (e.g., cetyltrimethylammonium bromide). Important similarities and differences are shown to exist between multicomponent silicate\xe2\x88\x92surfactant and conventional binary lyotropic liquid crystals. Under highly alkaline conditions, the silicate\xe2\x88\x92surfactant systems possess the characteristics of ordinary lyotropic liquid crystalline systems, though the balance of forces underlying their self-assembly is complicated by the richness of the aqueous silicate chemistry. This is the first comprehensive description of lyotropic silicate\xe2\x88\x92surfactant liquid crystalline behavior, from which detailed insight is obtained into the molecular factors governing inorganic\xe2\x88\x92organic mesophase formation in aqueous media.

"Density functional calculations were carried out on a series of oligomers of polyphosphazenes to characterize molecular structures and conformational properties of the polymers in isolation. Polyphosphazenes are found to have alternating P\xe2\x88\x92N bond lengths in the planar cis\xe2\x88\x92trans backbone conformation. The magnitude of the alternation is in the range of 0.03\xe2\x88\x920.07 \xc3\x85, depending on the substituents. The P\xe2\x88\x92N bond alternations are not present in the optimized helical chains. Rotation around the P\xe2\x88\x92N bond is very flexible; the barrier height to rotation of the P\xe2\x88\x92N bond in monophosphazene is about 2 kcal/mol. Systematic study of conformational properties of the oligomers suggests that isolated polyphosphazenes prefer twisted helical structures. The energy differences between the twisted and planar cis\xe2\x88\x92trans chains are ca. 5 kcal/mol per repeat unit. Intramolecular electrostatic interactions are found to be the dominant forces which determine the conformational states. The impact of different side chain substituents (halogen and organo side groups) was also studied. A study of the electronic structures of phosphazene suggests that the P\xe2\x88\x92N bonding consists of an ionic \xcf\x83 bond and a \xcf\x80 bond mainly induced by negative hyperconjugation:\xe2\x80\x89 \xcf\x80(N) \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x83*(P\xe2\x88\x92X). The new bonding model supercedes earlier ones and explains the structural and conformational properties reported in this and previous work on phosphazenes. "
"The specificity of neomycin B and related aminoglycoside antibiotics in their interaction with the Rev responsive element (RRE) of HIV-1 mRNA has been studied by directly observing the aminoglycoside\xe2\x88\x92RNA complexes using surface plasmon resonance. Several different RNA sequences, each with a biotin tag, have been prepared using T7 RNA polymerase-catalyzed transcription of synthetic DNA templates and have been immobilized on a streptavidin-coated surface for the binding study. The results indicate that neomycin B is not specific for the G-rich bubble region in RRE. Rather, it appears to interact with three different sites, each with a submicromolar dissociation constant, within the 67-nucleotide domain II of RRE. Further analysis of neomycin B binding with three short synthetic RNA hairpins showed binding with submicromolar affinity and 1:1 stoichiometry in each case. This suggests that neomycin B may generally bind with this affinity to regular A-form RNA or hairpin loops. The approach described here is generally useful for understanding the fundamental interactions involved in the specific recognition of nucleic acids by small molecules which is the basis of rational drug design.

"Peptide dimers of the basic leucine zipper protein with non-native monomer arrangements were synthesized by using C2 chiral templates as a synthetic dimerization module. The amino acid sequence of the peptide is derived from the DNA contact region of the basic leucine zipper protein GCN4. These peptide dimers are designed to possess different geometrical constraints from that of native GCN4 with respect to the orientation of two DNA-contacting peptides. Peptide dimers constrained at the 6th position from N-terminus recognized novel palindromic DNA sequences in which the polarity of each half-site of the parent GCN4 binding sequence is reversed. This is in contrast with dimers that are constrained at the N-terminus which failed to recognize the reversed DNA sequences. Sequence-specific recognition of these palindromic DNA sequences was confirmed by DNase I footprinting. Circular dichroism spectral analyses revealed that dimers constrained at the 6th position bind in the helical conformation to the reversed palindromic sequences, whereas the dimers constrained at the N-terminus bind the same sequence with less helical contents. The stability of specific binding complexes was not affected by the differences in the chirality of the template. However, the stability of the half-specific complex was dramatically affected by the particular enantiomer of the template. "
"Bleomycin A2 (BLMA2, a clinically used drug) and tallysomycin A (TLMA) are two closely related anticancer antibiotics activated by O2 reaction with their Fe(II) complexes. Fe(II) can be modeled by Zn(II). Evidence obtained that the disaccharide and metal-binding domains of ZnTLMA and ZnBLMA2 are superimposable includes the following very similar NMR features:\xe2\x80\x89 the 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts, the 1H and 13C chemical shift changes upon Zn(II) binding, and the NOESY spectra. We evaluated several ZnTLMA structural models with four and five ligating donor atoms from TLMA by using 2D NMR, NOESY back-calculation methods, and restrained molecular mechanics/molecular dynamics calculations. Our results are most consistent with ligation by five N donors, the \xce\xb2-aminoalanine (ALA) amines (NC2 and NC3), the pyrimidinylpropionamide (PRO) pyrimidine (NC10), and the \xce\xb2-hydroxyhistidine amide (NC12) and imidazole (NC29). Metal complexation to TLMA or BLMA2 creates newly stable chiral centers (the metal and the ALA secondary amine, NC3); for the first time, an extensive analysis of the chirality of both centers has been performed. A cross-peak between a PRO H and a disaccharide mannose H is clearly present in the low mixing time NOESY spectrum of ZnTLMA and in the published spectrum of ZnBLMA2. This cross-peak has led us to discover a novel square pyramid (sp) basket arrangement of the drug donor atoms, with PRO NC10 at the apex and SS chirality. A close variant, with donors adopting a trigonal bipyramidal (tbp) arrangement, gave results almost as satisfactory. Our findings raise interesting aspects relevant to drug activation. The literature suggests that the activated form is HO2Fe(III)BLMA2; the five N donors are in an SS-sp I arrangement, with the ALA primary amine (NC2) at the apex. If the Fe(II) form of the drugs had the SS-sp basket or SS-tbp arrangement, addition of O2 could yield products with the drug in an SS-sp I arrangement. Models with RR chirality, such as proposed previously for ZnBLMA2, are energetically unfavorable, cannot account for the NMR results, and cannot readily convert to the SS-sp I geometry. Unlike in RR models, the carbamoyl group of the mannose cannot bind to the metal in SS models. Instead, in our model the disaccharide covers the sixth binding site. "
"It has been known that oxo amide crystals made up of achiral molecules can be photochemically converted into optically active \xce\xb2-lactams by irradiation with a high pressure mercury lamp. Although the oxo amide crystal belongs to an enantiomorphic class D2, its optical activity could not be detected so far. We successfully measured the components of the gyration tensor of the oxo amide crystal by using the HAUP (high accuracy universal polarimeter) method:\xe2\x80\x89 g11 = \xe2\x88\x923.5 \xc3\x97 10-4 (\xe2\x88\x9279\xc2\xb0/mm), g22 = \xe2\x88\x921.4 \xc3\x97 10-4 (\xe2\x88\x9232\xc2\xb0/mm), g33 = \xe2\x88\x923.0 \xc3\x97 10-4 (\xe2\x88\x9268\xc2\xb0/mm) at 305 K, where the optical rotatory powers are indicated in parentheses. It has been proved by direct experiments that the optical activity of the reactant and the product in this reaction system remains unchanged over the photocyclization process. "
"The secondary \xce\xb1 deuterium and heavy atom kinetic isotope effects found for two different SN2 reactions suggest that the magnitude of secondary \xce\xb1 deuterium kinetic isotope effects can be determined by the length of only the shorter (stronger) reacting bond in an unsymmetrical SN2 transition state rather than by the usual nucleophile\xe2\x88\x92leaving group distance. Although this means the interpretation of these isotope effects is more complex than has been recognized, the results suggest that they can be used to determine whether an SN2 transition state is symmetrical or unsymmetrical.

"Our current theories on crystal lattice control of organic photochemistry were subjected to studies of type-B rearrangement of bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-3-en-2-ones. A first finding was that the solid state photochemistry differed dramatically from that in solution. One of our past observations in this bicyclic photochemistry in solution was that the six-membered ring, type B, zwitterion was a ubiquitous intermediate. This intermediate invariably underwent a preferential migration of an aryl group to carbon-2 relative to carbon-4 with formation of a 2,3-disubstituted phenol, a result deriving from electronic effects. In contrast, the crystal lattice photochemistry revealed a regioselectivity depending on the surrounding lattice rather than electronics. Perhaps an even more dramatic difference was an observation of the dependence of reactant stereochemistry. Thus, in solution, for 6,6-disubstituted bicyclics with two different groups at C-6, a common zwitterion is formed and the same photoproduct is formed independent of reactant stereochemistry. In crystal lattices the endo and exo stereoisomers of the 6,6-disubstituted bicyclics react differently and the group originally endo tends to migrate after three-ring opening to the zwitterion. The experimental results were paralleled with a theoretical analysis. This consisted of generation of a \xe2\x80\x9cmini crystal lattice\xe2\x80\x9d with sufficient lattice molecules to completely surround a central, reacting electronically excited state molecule. Then computational extraction of the central molecule and replacement by a transition structure afford a model of the reacting excited state inside the crystal lattice. Overlap of this species with the lattice neighbors and energy computations are then possible. These permit prediction and understanding of excited state crystal lattice reactivity on a quantitative basis. "
"Synthesis of novel nucleoside bicyclic trisanhydrides 7 in the reaction of nucleoside-5\xe2\x80\x98-methylenebis(phosphonate)s (4) with DCC is described. They were obtained by P1,P3- and P2,P4-dehydration of initially formed P1,P2,P3,P4-bismethylenetetraphosphonate 6. Reaction of 7 (N = 2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-O-isopropylideneadenosin-5\xe2\x80\x98-yl) with 2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-O-isopropylidenetiazofurin gave, after hydrolysis and deisopropylidenation, \xce\xb2-methylene-TAD (10a), the known potent inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). Similar reaction of 7 with benzyl 2,3-O-isopropylidene-\xce\xb2-d-riboside followed by hydrolysis and deprotection afforded a new methylenebis(phosphonate) analogue of ADP-ribose 10b. Upon reaction of 7 with riboflavin, the corresponding \xce\xb2-methylene-FAD (10c) was obtained. Bicyclic trisanhydride 7 prepared from (2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-O-isopropylidene-N4-acetylcytidin-5\xe2\x80\x98-yl)methylenebis(phosphonate) was used in the synthesis of the methylenebis(phosphonate) analogues of CDP-ethanolamine 10d and CDP-dipalmitoylglycerol 10e.

"Chemical modification of pre-formed asymmetric polyazaphane scaffolds by simultaneous addition of functionality (letters) in solution has been developed for the preparation of tertiary nitrogen-based combinatorial chemistry libraries. This approach has some significant advantages over the more commonly employed solid phase bead splitting/reaction/mixing procedures for the preparation of libraries. Three novel, asymmetric polyazaphanes 32, 33, and 37 have been synthesized in high yields by an efficient cyclization of 2,6-bis(bromomethyl)pyridine (31) with new orthogonally protected triamines 29, 30, and 35, respectively. Selective deprotection of 32, 33, and 37 provided mono-t-Boc-protected scaffolds 1\xe2\x88\x923 suitable for solution phase, simultaneous addition of functionalities. Model studies of small libraries of scaffold 2 using CZE analyses indicated that simultaneous addition of 10 benzylic bromide alkylating functionalities would result in libraries containing approximately equimolar amounts of all possible compounds. Sixteen purified tertiary amine libraries 4\xe2\x88\x9219 (total complexity of 1600 compounds) were generated by this procedure from scaffold 2. A \xe2\x80\x9cfix-last\xe2\x80\x9d combinatorial method was devised to minimize chemical reactions. Several first-round sublibraries of scaffold 2, containing a mixture of 100 compounds, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities. Twenty single compounds 63\xe2\x88\x9282 with uniform functionalities at the combinatorialized sites were synthesized. Some of these pure compounds were more active, while others were less active, compared with the parent mixtures 5 and 10. "
"Cycloaddition reaction of 2-vinyloxiranes with carbodiimides using Pd2(dba)3\xc2\xb7CHCl3, and TolBINAP as the chiral ligand, in THF at ambient temperature, afforded 4-vinyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-imines in 70\xe2\x88\x9299% yield and in up to 95% ee. The stereoselectivity is strongly influenced by the structure of the chiral phosphine ligands and substrates, as well as by the reaction conditions. The enantiodetermination step is assumed to be nucleophilic attack of a nitrogen nucleophile on a \xcf\x80-allyl palladium intermediate. Reaction of 2-vinyloxiranes with isocyanates using the same catalyst system afforded 4-vinyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-ones in high yield but in no greater than 50% ee. "
"The syntheses of complexes MH2L4 and their protonated analogues [MH3L4]+ (M = Fe (1), Ru (2), Os (3); R = Me (a), Et (b)) are described. The structures of 1a, 1b, and 3a were determined in X-ray diffraction studies. The solution structures of complexes 1\xe2\x88\x923 were established by detailed NMR investigations. 1a, 2b, and 3a form equilibrium mixtures of two isomers in solution. The iron (1a) and ruthenium (2b) complexes isomerize between six-coordinate M(II) dihydrogen cis-[MH(H2)L4]+ and seven-coordinate M(IV) trihydride [M(H)3L4]+ molecular geometries:\xe2\x80\x89 the first is a distorted octahedron and the second can be viewed as a hydride-capped M(PR3)4 tetrahedron. Complex 3a is a pentagonal bipyramidal trihydride cis-[Os(H)3(PMe3)4]+ in equilibrium with the hydride-capped tetrahedral structural form. Trihydrides 1b and 3b are exclusively represented by the latter structural type. The cationic molecule 2a corresponds to a dihydrogen complex cis-[RuH(H2)(PMe3)4]+. The metal fragment [MH(PR3)4]+ is thus most reactive toward oxidative addition of H2 for osmium and iron, with a notably lower ability to reduce H2 for ruthenium. This trend and related properties are due to electronic rather than steric factors. All [MH3(PR3)4]+ species (1\xe2\x88\x923) are fluxional in solution. The intramolecular hydride exchanges and isomerizations were studied between 20 and \xe2\x88\x92140 \xc2\xb0C and quantitatively described in terms of their activation parameters. On the basis of these, mechanistic interpretations are provided. Finally the acid/base properties of the [MH3(PR3)4]+/M(H)2(PR3)4 systems were established in a series of NMR experiments in THF-d8. The pKa values range from 10.3 to 12.9 units and increase in the following order:\xe2\x80\x89 1a (10.3) < 2b (10.7) < 2a (10.9) < 3a (11.2) < 3b (12.9). This series demonstrates a higher acidity than that of the related [MH(H2)(PP)2]+ molecules with bidentate ligands. The complexes with monodentate phosphine ligands [MH3(PR3)4]+ (1\xe2\x88\x923) represent a new and distinguished family with structural, dynamic, and acid/base properties remarkably different from most of the other known [MH3L4]+ representatives.

"A model for the structure of the zeolite SSZ-31 is presented. The model is obtained by combining information from adsorption capacity measurements, transmission electron microscopy, and high-resolution X-ray diffraction. SSZ-31 is a one-dimensional large-pore zeolite with a framework density of 18.7 tetrahedral(T)-atoms per nm-3 and a bulk density of 1.87 g cm-3. The pore apertures are elliptical with major and minor axes of approximately 8.6 \xc3\x85 \xc3\x97 5.7 \xc3\x85. SSZ-31 is an extreme example of a complex and highly faulted zeolite. The structure can be described as an intergrowth of four different but structurally related polymorphs. "
"In this paper we report the Cp\xe2\x80\x982Ln/Me2SiCp\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x982Ln-catalyzed (Cp\xe2\x80\x98 = \xce\xb75-Me5C5; Cp\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 = \xce\xb75-Me4C5) hydrogenation of acyclic imines to yield the corresponding amines. At 190 psi of H2, the observed turnover frequencies (h-1) (100:1 substrate:catalyst ratio, Cp\xe2\x80\x982Ln, temperature (\xc2\xb0C)) are (1) (N-benzylidene(methyl)amine, Ln = La, 50) 0.03; (Ln = Sm, 90) 1.0; (Ln = Sm + PhSiH3, 90) 2.2; (Ln = Lu, 90) 0.60; (2) (N-benzylideneaniline, Ln = Sm, 90) 0.10; (3) (N-benzylidene(trimethylsilyl)amine, Ln = Sm, 90) 0.40; (4) (N-(\xce\xb1-methylbenzylidene)(methyl)amine, Ln = Sm, 90) 0.20; (5) (N-(\xce\xb1-methylbenzylidene)(benzyl)amine, Ln = Sm, 90) 0.70. The stoichiometric reaction of N-benzylidene(methyl)amine with Cp\xe2\x80\x982SmCH(SiMe3)2 or (Cp\xe2\x80\x982SmH)2 yields an orthometalated Cp\xe2\x80\x982Sm\xe2\x88\x92substrate complex which undergoes either hydrogenolysis/hydrogenation or competing CN insertion of a second substrate molecule to yield a Cp\xe2\x80\x982Sm-imine\xe2\x88\x92amido complex with a seven-membered chelate ring. The stoichiometric reaction of 2-methyl-1-pyrroline with Cp\xe2\x80\x982SmCH(SiMe3)2 or (Cp\xe2\x80\x982SmH)2 yields a Cp\xe2\x80\x982Sm-imine\xe2\x88\x92amido complex in which two substrate molecules have been coupled to form a six-membered chelate ring (characterized by X-ray diffraction). The stoichiometric reaction of N-benzylidene(trimethylsilyl)amine with (Cp\xe2\x80\x982SmH)2 yields a desilylated Cp\xe2\x80\x982Sm-imine\xe2\x88\x92amido complex with a four-membered Sm(NSiMe3)(CPh)NCHPh chelate ring (characterized by X-ray diffraction). Additional heating of this product under H2 yields S6-symmetric (Cp\xe2\x80\x982SmCN)6, which contains an unusual chairlike 18-membered (SmCN)6 ring (characterized by X-ray diffraction). "
"Important features of the internal chemistry of the quadruple perovskite family of layered cuprates, such as solid solution behavior, stable defect species, and oxidation behavior, have been investigated by structural and physical property measurements and related to the inner architecture of these potential superconductors. In-situ high-temperature (650\xe2\x88\x92800 \xc2\xb0C) electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements have been performed, in various oxygen partial pressures, on pure and chemically substituted Ln\xe2\x80\x98Ln\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Ba2Cu2Ti2O11 (Ln\xe2\x80\x98Ln\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 = LaY or NdDy) compounds. The electrical properties display transitions from dual carrier (intrinsic) semiconductivity to extrinsically doped p-type semiconductivity as a function of chemical composition, temperature, and oxygen pressure. The exclusion of interstitial oxygen defects between the copper\xe2\x88\x92oxygen double layers, as evidenced in the weak oxygen partial pressure dependence of the electrical properties in the LaYBa2Cu2Ti2O11 systems, is directly related to the A-site order and is an important step toward achieving superconductivity by preserving the structural integrity of the CuO22- planes. The electrical properties of the NdDy system, however, are strong functions of the oxygen partial pressure, indicating that oxygen defects play an important role in determining their properties. Oxidation of the latter compound has been achieved, and underdoped metallic behavior reminiscent of known superconductors has been observed at low temperatures (100\xe2\x88\x92300 K). Jonker analysis of the electrical properties of the highly oxidized material further illustrates the similarity of the transport behavior of the quadruple perovskites to superconducting cuprates. A combination of synthesis and annealing methods which allow for both increased substitution levels and carrier concentrations should lead to superconductivity in the ordered-lanthanide quadruple perovskites.

"The title electride crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcn with a = 10.060(4) \xc3\x85, b = 23.134(8) \xc3\x85, c = 8.380(4) \xc3\x85, and z = 4. A second powdered phase of unknown structure, but with rather different properties, forms when rapidly precipitated \xe2\x80\x9cseed\xe2\x80\x9d powder is used. The crystalline phase contains electron-trapping cavities, each of approximate diameter 4.3 \xc3\x85, connected in zigzag fashion along the c axis by rather open channels of minimum diameter 2.4 \xc3\x85 (center-to-center distance 7.9 \xc3\x85). Each cavity is also connected to next-neighbor cavities, 8.2 \xc3\x85 away along c, by channels of diameter 1.5 \xc3\x85. Inter-chain channels are <1.0 \xc3\x85 in diameter so that the cavity-channel structure is well-described as \xe2\x80\x9cladder-like\xe2\x80\x9d. Replacing the trapped electron by Na- in the corresponding sodide, Li+ (cryptand [2.1.1])Na-, results in an orthorhombic structure (space group Pna21). Although the anionic sites in the sodide are only slightly bigger than those in the electride, the channel structure is markedly different, forming a 3-dimensional network. The magnetic susceptibilities of both phases of the electride above 14 K are well-fit by the linear chain Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model with values of J/kB of \xe2\x88\x9254 (crystals) and \xe2\x88\x9217.8 K (powder). Both types show marked deviations below 14 K toward greater spin-pairing. This behavior was verified by EPR measurements of intensity vs temperature. The electride was characterized further by two probe pressed pellet conductivity, variable temperature 7Li MAS-NMR, and DSC. "
"Reaction of (R2PC2H4PR2)Ni(C2H4) with COT gives the mononuclear complexes (R2PC2H4PR2)Ni(\xce\xb72-C8H8) (R = iPr 1a, tBu 1b). The COT ligand in 1a,b is planar with alternating C\xe2\x88\x92C and CC bonds, corresponding to a formal semiaromatic [C8H8]- ligand. Reactions of 1a with (iPr2PC2H4PiPr2)Ni(\xce\xb72,\xce\xb72-C6H10) and of 1b with stoichiometric amounts of {(tBu2PC2H4PtBu2)Ni}2(\xce\xbc-C6H6) or lithium afford the dinuclear complexes {(iPr2PC2H4PiPr2)Ni}2{\xce\xbc-\xce\xb74(1,2,5,6):\xce\xb74(3,4,7,8)-C8H8} (2a) and {(tBu2PC2H4PtBu2)Ni}2(\xce\xbc-\xce\xb72:\xce\xb72-C8H8) (2b; two isomers). The COT ligand in 2a is tub-shaped and olefinic, whereas in 2b (as in 1a,b) it is planar and semiaromatic. The products are characterized by IR, solution and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and by X-ray structure analysis. "
"On the basis of high-level molecular quantum mechanics, the zero-point-corrected energy for formation of the anti-anti conformer of carbonic acid from water and carbon dioxide is compensated by formation of the most stable dimer. Therefore, the zero-point-corrected energy for formation of the carbonic acid dimer from its constituents water and carbon dioxide is close to zero, and even slightly negative values seem to be possible. These results include new CCSD(T)/6-311++G(3df,3pd) calculations of the formation energy of carbonic acid from water and carbon dioxide, which gave an energy difference of between 8.2 and 9.2 kcal/mol which is lower than those reported before. Furthermore, the dimerization energy of carbonic acid and formic acid is reported up to the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, leading to a best estimate of \xe2\x88\x9216.9 kcal/mol for the carbonic acid dimer relying on convergence considerations for the MP2/aug-cc-pVxZ level of theory that also clearly reveal the failure of counterpoise correction for basis set superposition error. We conclude that in our atmosphere formation of a dimer of carbonic acid is disfavored mainly by entropy, and not by enthalpy."
"Nitrile hydratase (NHase) from Rhodococcus sp. N-771 is a novel enzyme that possesses a non-heme iron(III) center binding endogenous nitric oxide (NO). It is inactivated by aerobic incubation of cells in the dark, whereas the inactive form is converted to the active one by light irradiation. To clarify the mechanism of activity regulation in the NHase, we investigated the role of NO. When the inactive NHase was irradiated in the presence of Fe(II) ions and a spin trap, N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (MGD), three hyperfine lines from the nitrogen atom of the [(MGD)2-FeII-NO] complex were resolved, indicating that NO was released from the enzyme upon photoactivation. The amount of NO release was obtained as 0.99 \xc2\xb1 0.12 per enzyme (n = 4) by using an NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide. The active NHase was completely inactivated by exogenous NO, and upon photoirradiation 86% of the original activity was restored. FTIR, ESR, and UV\xe2\x88\x92VIS absorption measurements confirmed the view that association of NO restores the original inactive form of the enzyme. The rate constant for nitrosylation of the enzyme activated by a laser pulse asymptotically increased with an increase in NO concentration. A kinetic analysis of the NHase nitrosylation demonstrated that inactivation of the enzyme by NO binding proceeded via an intermediate. The rate constant for inactivation and the quantum yield of photoactivation were determined as 14 s-1 and 0.48, respectively. It is thus concluded that the activity of the NHase is regulated by nitrosylation and photoinduced denitrosylation of the non-heme iron center. This finding provides a new aspect regarding biological function of NO, i.e., regulation of the enzymatic activity with the aid of light. "
"An understanding of DNA\xe2\x88\x92ligand interactions at the molecular level is important for the design of new drugs and probes that can recognize specific DNA sequences and structural motifs. Interestingly, determining the mode-of-binding of a DNA ligand is not always straightforward due to uncertainties inherent in traditional assays. We have recently reported an exciting new assay utilizing scanning force microscopy (SFM) that can discern whether a ligand binds to DNA by intercalative or nonintercalative modes [Coury et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996, 93, 12283\xe2\x88\x9212286]. Visualization of individual DNA molecules by SFM and observation of ligand-induced lengthening provides direct evidence for intercalation. Metal complexes of polypyridyl ligands have been extensively studied as new probes of DNA structure and function because they exist as chiral molecules with the potential of enantioselective recognition of DNA. The binding mode of even the most widely studied of the members of this group, tris(o-phenanthroline)ruthenium(II) (Ru(phen)32+), remains somewhat controversial due in large part to its low binding affinity. We report here the use of Ru(phen)32+ as a test of our new assay toward the studies of weakly-binding ligands and to resolve the ambiguity surrounding the mode-of-binding of \xce\x94 and \xce\x9b-Ru(phen)32+. Experiments reported here reveal that the experimental conditions of our assay do not preclude the binding of Ru(phen)32+ to DNA and that NO lengthening occurs. Our findings are consistent with the view that Ru(phen)32+ binds to duplex nucleic acids through nonintercalative modes. "
"The mixing behavior of phosphoethanolamine (PE)-like and phosphoglycerol (PG)-like lipids have been examined in the fluid bilayer state by use of nearest-neighbor recognition methods [Vigmond, S. J.; Dewa, T.; Regen, S. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 7838]. Disulfide-based phospholipid dimers derived from 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DMPE) have been synthesized, containing PE- and PG-like head groups. Subsequent exchange and equilibration of the monomer units, via thiolate\xe2\x88\x92disulfide interchange, produced a nonstatistical distribution of dimers in the fluid bilayer phase (60 \xc2\xb0C); i.e., a heterodimer/homodimer ratio of 1.76 \xc2\xb1 0.05 was formed. Analogous membranes that were rich in cholesterol (i.e., 29 mol %) produced a statistical mixture of dimers. Equilibration experiments that were carried out using PE-like and PG-like lipids derived from 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) and DMPE, respectively, gave similar results, except that a greater level of nearest-neighbor recognition was evident in the absence of cholesterol. The biological implications of these findings are briefly discussed. "
"A 2,2-dimethylbutynoic acid with a pyridone terminus (1) acts as its self-complement in molecular recognition to form an intermolecularly hydrogen-bonded dimer with hydrogen bonding between the amide and carboxylic acid group. The dimer is found in crystals of 1 by X-ray diffraction, in chloroform solution by 1H-NMR experiments and vapor pressure osmometry, and in the gas phase by FAB-MS. "
"It is demonstrated on a polycrystalline powder sample of Cd3(PO4)2, given a known single-crystal X-ray structure, that two-dimensional 31P double-quantum single-quantum MAS correlation experiments allow unique assignment of multiple 31P resonances to specific P sites in the structure of such inorganic orthophosphates. The eigenvalues of the 31P and 113Cd shielding tensors of Cd3(PO4)2 are reported, the determination of which requires usage of a 2D MAS spinning sideband separation experiment. "
"The proton NMR chemical shift has been measured for water from 25 to 600 \xc2\xb0C and from 1 to 400 bar, conditions extending well beyond the critical point. Dilute solutes were employed as chemical shift references to avoid the effect of the varying magnetic susceptibility. The large changes in chemical shift (4.1 ppm) are interpreted as changes in the hydrogen bond network, because all other intermolecular interactions are known to result in much smaller effects. Using a linear relation between chemical shift and the mean number of hydrogen bonds, the NMR results show there are still 29% as many hydrogen bonds at 400 \xc2\xb0C and 400 bar (\xcf\x81 = 0.52 g/cm3 ) as for room temperature water. The present results are compared to other measurements and calculations. "
"Earlier NMR experiments (Canceill et. al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985, 107, 6993) have shown that the inclusion of bromochlorofluoromethane (CHFClBr) 1 within the cavity of (\xe2\x88\x92)-cryptophane-C 2 in chloroform solution is enantioselective and that (\xe2\x88\x92)-1 is more strongly bound than (+)-1 with a free energy difference (\xce\x94\xce\x94G\xc2\xb0)exp of 1.1 kJ mol-1. In order to gain information on the relative configuration of the diastereomeric complexes and hence on the absolute configuration of 1, we have tried to reproduce these experiments by computational methods, and we have calculated the free energy difference for the binding of (R) and (S)-1 to (\xe2\x88\x92)-2. For this purpose, the OPLS parameters for CHFClBr were optimized by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the pure liquid. Then molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the host\xe2\x88\x92guest system in a solvent box of chloroform using multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration (MCTI) and free energy perturbation (FEP) methods to calculate the free energy difference between the diastereomeric complexes. The [(R)-1@(\xe2\x88\x92)-2] complex was thus calculated to be more stable than the [(S)-1@(\xe2\x88\x92)-2] one by (\xce\x94\xce\x94G\xc2\xb0)calc 0\xe2\x88\x922.6 kJ mol-1, which is of the same order of magnitude as the experimental result. Since the [(\xe2\x88\x92)-1@(\xe2\x88\x92)-2] complex is more stable than the [(+)-1@(\xe2\x88\x92)-2] one, and since the absolute configuration of 2 is known, it was concluded that the absolute configuration of CHFClBr must be (R)-(\xe2\x88\x92) (or (S)-(+)); this conclusion is in agreement with a recent independent assignment based on Raman Optical Activity studies.

"Recent kinetic measurements of the oxidation of linoleic acid by soybean lipoxygenase show that the thermal rate constants, kH = 280 (\xc2\xb112) s-1 and kD = 5.0 (\xc2\xb10.1) s-1, are weakly temperature dependent within the temperature interval 30\xe2\x88\x9250 \xc2\xb0C. The primary kinetic kH/kD isotope effect is almost temperature independent, and is one order of magnitude larger than expected for a single rate determining isotopically sensitive step. It has therefore been predicted that hydrogen tunneling predominates in this enzyme-catalyzed reaction (Jonsson, T.; Glickman, M. H.; Sun, S.; Klinman, J. P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 10319). Our analysis shows that the lipoxygenase reaction can indeed proceed through a wholly quantum-mechanical pathway. While neither a tunneling correction nor ground-state tunneling of a proton through a one-dimensional potential barrier gives a satisfactory explanation for the isotope effects as measured in the experiment, a dissociation involving a two-step mechanism can explain the experimental observations. The first step is the rate-determining step where a hydrogen species tunnels from linoleic acid to lipoxygenase through a two-dimensional potential barrier. The second step is a relaxation process where an electron is transferred from the metastable intermediate to the Fe3+ cofactor in the enzyme active site. This electron transfer causes hydrogen tunneling to be effectively irreversible without introducing a temperature dependence to the reaction. We should note, however, that the two steps are not separable, and cannot be seen as a sequence of independent processes. A consequence of this model is that the tunneling pathways of hydrogen and deuterium are not identical, influencing the magnitude of the measured kH/kD isotope effect. This model also serves as an explanation for the role of iron in lipoxygenase, in contrast to the role of iron in many other oxygenases. Iron centers in oxygenases are often necessary for oxygen activation, yet there is no evidence that the iron cofactor in lipoxygenase interacts with molecular oxygen at any stage of the catalytic cycle (Glickman, M. H.; Klinman, J. P. Biochemistry 1996, 35, 12882). In lipoxygenase, it is possible that reduction of the ferric iron cofactor serves as an electron sink that drives hydrogen tunneling. An electron-gated hydrogen transfer mechanism, such as suggested, could also have relevance to an array of non-enzymatic organometallic reactions. "
"Studies were undertaken to explore the application of tandem mass spectrometry for the structure analysis of unfractionated mixtures of oligonucleotides. Limited combinatorial libraries were constructed of mixtures of 8-mers (NGACACNG; nine compounds) and 12-mers (NGACTNAGACNG; 27 compounds), where N is any of the 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyribonucleotides of uracil, thymine, or 5-[N-(aminoethyl)-3-acrylimido]uracil. Molecular mass measurements of the mixture components (single mass analyzer) in the simplest cases or acquisition of collision-induced dissociation mass spectra (tandem mass analyzers) for mixtures of sequence isomers of the same molecular mass were used to establish guidelines for structure assignments. Although the construction of mass sequencing ladders from gas phase backbone cleavage reactions is notably more complex in the case of isomeric mixtures than for the single isomer case, assignment ambiguities are reduced by the presence of nonrandomized sequence positions and by recognition of likely fragment ion relative abundances. The approaches described offer a significant advance toward solving problems common to the development of oligonucleotide therapeutics using combinatorial synthesis techniques. "
"The conversion of 4-chlorobenzoate to 4-hydroxybenzoate is carried out by first esterifying 4-chlorobenzoate by coenzyme A, and the resulting 4-chlorobenzoyl CoA serves as substrate for the 4-chlorobenzoyl CoA dehalogenase. To gain a better appreciation of the catalytic mechanism and factors controlling the catalytic efficacy of this dehalogenase, the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction between 4-Cl-Ph-CO-SCH3 and CH3COO- was investigated in detail in both gas phase and solution (the -CH2COO- entity of Asp145 is the enzyme nucleophile). Quantum mechanical methods (HF/6-31G*, B3LYP/6-311+G**, and PM3) were used to elucidate the gas phase reaction. The gas phase reaction profile is best described as a two-well potential surface, with the two minima corresponding to reactant-side and product-side ion\xe2\x88\x92molecule complexes. There is a small overall potential energy barrier, but the free energy barrier is significant. On the HF/6-31G* potential energy surface, no minimum corresponding to the Meisenheimer intermediate was found; however, there is a shallow one on the PM3 surface. Overall, the PM3 results match the density functional theory results (B3LYP/6-311+G**) closely, suggesting that PM3 is a reasonable method to study this kind of reaction. This finding will allow us to investigate the enzymatic reaction directly using a hybrid PM3/MM approach. As shown from the influence of solvation effect on the reaction profile determined by a self-consistent reaction field model, there is a large reaction barrier in solution. On the basis of the above findings, the factors controlling the catalytic efficacy of the 4-chlorobenzoyl CoA dehalogenase were examined. We also studied the hydrolysis of the aryl\xe2\x88\x92enzyme intermediate and a related nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction between tetrachlorohydroquinone and glutathione (as modeled by thiomethoxide). In addition, a simple explanation concerning the previously unresolved abnormal Br\xc3\xb8nsted behavior of Tyr6Phe mutant of a \xce\xbc class glutathione S-transferase is provided. "
"Variable temperature 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopic analysis of THF and THF\xe2\x88\x92HMPA solutions of stannylcyanocuprates, as well as their addition products to 1-alkynyl ethers have been conducted. When prepared in the presence of HMPA, the reagents and addition products formed exist as mixtures in which some free lithium cyanide is present and the remaining cyanide is otherwise complexed. When stannylcyanocuprates were prepared in THF solutions no LiCN was detected. Heteronuclear NMR of the intermediates formed in the low-temperature reaction of a 13C-labeled acetylenic ether with a THF\xe2\x88\x92HMPA solution of stannylcyanocuprate (Bu3Sn)2Cu(13CN)Li2 reveals a 13CN\xe2\x88\x9213C-vinyl carbon coupling consistent with a vinylcuprate intermediate containing cyanide and a vinyl group bound to a common center. Coupling between a metal bound 119Sn and 13C-vinyl carbon was observed in the intermediate suggesting these two atoms are bound to a common center. The lack of 119Sn\xe2\x88\x9213CN coupling in the intermediate suggested 119Sn and 13CN were bound to different atoms. Requirements are met in both higher order and lower order cuprate structures. When \xe2\x80\x9cMe2Cu(13CN)Li2\xe2\x80\x9d is prepared in THF, no free LiCN is observed and neither is it generated on addition of HMPA. When Me2Cu(13CN)Li2 is prepared in HMPA-containing solutions it exists with the corresponding cyanide-free species and LiCN. "
"Several ruthenium-based olefin metathesis catalysts of the formula (PR3)2X2RuCHCHCPh2 have been synthesized, and relative catalyst activities were determined by monitoring the ring-closing metathesis of the acyclic diene diethyl diallylmalonate. The following order of increasing activity was determined:\xe2\x80\x89 X = I < Br < Cl and PR3 = PPh3 \xe2\x89\xaa PiPr2Ph < PCy2Ph < PiPr3 < PCy3. Additional studies were conducted with the catalyst (PCy3)2Cl2RuCH2 to probe the mechanism of olefin metathesis by this class of catalysts. The data support a scheme in which there are two competing pathways:\xe2\x80\x89 the dominant one in which a phosphine dissociates from the ruthenium center and a minor one in which both phosphines remain bound. Higher catalyst activites could be achieved by the addition of CuCl to the reaction. "
"This study considers how the electronic relaxation rate enhancement effects of strong antiferromagnetic coupling in the FeIII\xe2\x88\x92X\xe2\x88\x92CuII unit (X = O2-, OH-) of complexes [(F8-TPP)FeIII\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92CuII(TMPA)]+ (1), and [(F8-TPP)FeIII\xe2\x88\x92OH\xe2\x88\x92CuII(TMPA)]+ (2) (F8-TPP = tetrakis(2,6-difluorophenyl)porphyrinate(2\xe2\x88\x92); TMPA = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine) are manifested as observable upfield-shifted resonances of the TMPA moiety in the 1H-NMR spectra. The pyrrole resonances appear at 65 and 69 ppm, respectively, for 1 and 2, consistent with an S = 2 ground state derived from antiferromagnetic coupling of high-spin FeIII (S = 5/2) and CuII (S = 1/2) through the bridging ligand X. Paramagnetic mononuclear complexes [Co(TMPA)(CH3CN)]2+ (S = 3/2) (X-ray structure reported) and [Cu(TMPA)(CH3CN)]2+ (S = 1/2) demonstrate downfield-shifted peaks consistent with a \xcf\x83 contact shift mechanism. Assignments for all complexes were achieved via 1H- and 2H-NMR spectroscopy of appropriately synthesized methylated and deuteriated derivatives. In [Cu(TMPA)(CH3CN)]2+, the observed ligand peaks (298 K) are broad; in 1, however, they are considerably sharper and upfield-shifted to \xe2\x88\x9261, \xe2\x88\x927, 4.5, \xe2\x88\x9221, and \xe2\x88\x92104 ppm, corresponding to pyridyl 6-H, 5-H, 4-H, and 3-H and aminomethyl \xe2\x88\x92CH2\xe2\x88\x92, respectively, of TMPA. The observance of these upfield peaks is a consequence of enhancement of the electronic relaxation rate for CuII due to antiferromagnetic coupling with the faster relaxing FeIII. This observation represents the prototype of a FeIII\xe2\x88\x92X\xe2\x88\x92CuII S = 2 spin state hitherto only theoretically predicted. The attenuation of \xce\xb4 for a particular hydrogen as its distance (through bonds) from CuII increases correlates with a \xcf\x83 contact shift mechanism. Only one peak per type of pyridyl H is observed (from 220 to 300 K for 1 and from 220 to 270 K for 2), indicating dynamic behavior of the Cu\xe2\x88\x92TMPA moiety in solution. Both 1 and 2 exhibit pseudo-Curie temperature dependence manifested as augmentation of \xce\xb4 in both upfield and downfield directions as temperature is lowered. Linear Curie and anti-Curie plots of the pyrrole and TMPA chemical shifts (from 220 to 300 K for 1 and from 220 to 270 K for 2) imply a predominantly S = 2 spin state in each case; i.e., the extent of antiferromagnetic coupling is strong. "
"A synthetic approach to a two-dimensional grid polymer is proposed and the execution of initial steps is described. Pd-catalyzed coupling of (1,12-dicarba-closo-dodecaboran-1-yl)copper (10) with iodobenzene, m-diiodobenzene, and 1,3,5-triiodobenzene yielded the known 1,12-dicarba-closo-dodecaboran-1-ylbenzene (3) and the new m-bis(1,12-dicarba-closo-dodecaboran-1-yl)benzene (4) and 1,3,5-tris(1,12-dicarba-closo-dodecaboran-1-yl)benzene (1), respectively. Each arm of the trigonal connector 1 was provided with one or two sticky tentacles by conversion to 1,3,5-tris[12-((3-(ethylthio)propyl)dimethylsilyl)-1,12-dicarba-closo-dodecaboran-1-yl]benzene (7) and 1,3,5-tris[12-(bis(3-(ethylthio)propyl)methylsilyl)-1,12-dicarba-closo-dodecaboran-1-yl]benzene (8). Linear coupling of carboranyl CH terminals through a mercury atom produced very stable dimeric structures from 3 and 4. The carborane 3, its mercury-linked dimer 13, the 1:1 complex of 13 with 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridyl, and the 2:1 complex of 13 with 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyrimidyl have been structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, but crystals of 1 showed an intriguing disorder and could not be used for molecular structure determination. Grazing incidence IR spectra show that the tentacled species 7 and 8 adsorb firmly on the surface of gold, apparently without a strong preference for a particular orientation. At room temperature, the tritentacled species 7 can be removed readily and the hexatentacled species 8 more slowly by treatment with a THF solution containing fluoride, which severs the tentacles. "
"The elusive POF4- anion has been characterized for the first time. It is formed from N(CH3)4F and POF3 in CHF3 solution at \xe2\x88\x92140 \xc2\xb0C and can be observed at this temperature by 19F and 31P NMR spectroscopy. Between \xe2\x88\x92140 and \xe2\x88\x92100 \xc2\xb0C it reacts with POF3 forming the OF2P\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92PF5- anion, which, at higher temperatures, reacts with F- anions to give PO2F2- and PF6-. This reaction sequence provides a low activation energy barrier pathway for the highly exothermic dismutation of pseudo-trigonal-bipyramidal POF4- to tetrahedral PO2F2- and octahedral PF6- and explains the previous failures to isolate POF4- salts. In addition to POF4-, OF2POPF5-, and PO2F2-, the protonated form of OF2POPF5-, i.e., HOF2POPF5, was also identified as a byproduct by NMR spectroscopy. The structure, vibrational spectra, force field, NMR parameters, and dismutation energy of POF4- were calculated by ab initio electronic structure methods using, where required, the closely related and well-known PF4- ion and POF3, PF3, SOF4, and SF4 molecules for the determination of scaling factors. Although the structures and dismutation energies of isoelectronic POF4- and SOF4 are very similar, their dismutation behavior is strikingly different. While POF4- dismutates rapidly at low temperatures, SOF4 is kinetically stable toward dismutation to SO2F2 and SF6. This fact is attributed to the lack of a low activation energy barrier pathway for SOF4. Furthermore, the dismutation energy calculations for POF4-, SOF4, and ClOF3 revealed very large errors in the previously published thermodynamic data for the heats of formations of SO2F2 and SOF4 and the dismutation reaction energy of POF4-. Energy barriers and the C4v transition states for the Berry-style pseudorotational exchange of equatorial and axial fluorines in POF4-, SOF4, PF4-, and SF4 were also calculated and can account for the observation that on the NMR time scale the exchange in PF4- and SF4 can be frozen out at about \xe2\x88\x9240 \xc2\xb0C, while in POF4- and SOF4 it is still rapid at \xe2\x88\x92140 and \xe2\x88\x92150 \xc2\xb0C, respectively.

"We have studied the stretching frequency (extrapolated to zero coverage) of adsorbed CO and the 195Pt NMR (before adsorption of CO) of Pt catalysts on zeolite-NaY (three dispersions), on zeolite-NaHY (two dispersions), and on zeolite-NaX (one dispersion); we have also measured the hydrogen and oxygen chemisorption capacity of these samples. For comparison, we studied three samples on an oxidic carrier (unpromoted and promoted by Li or K salts, all from the same initial batch) by infrared and by NMR. In the zeolite case, we find a direct correlation between the CO stretching frequency and the density of states at the Fermi energy on surface sites (surface Ef-LDOS) derived from the clean-surface NMR data, but the chemisorption results seem to be determined by steric as well as electronic effects, and show no simple relation to the two other quantities. The values for the oxidic samples appear to form a distinct set, with probably some promotor-specific effects. The zeolite data support an interpretation of the concept of \xe2\x80\x9celectron deficiency\xe2\x80\x9d not in terms of missing electronic charge, but in terms of a low density of states at the Fermi energy on surface sites. This is consistent with ideas derived from the frontier-orbital picture for metal\xe2\x88\x92adsorbate interaction. It remains unclear why the surface Ef-LDOS show a systematic variation with the acidity of the faujasite framework. "
"The energetics and mechanism for dehydrogenation of ethene by early transition metals were examined. Reaction of Ti+ and V+ led to collision complexes that decomposed by H2 loss on the metastable time frame (5\xe2\x88\x9215 \xce\xbcs). Kinetic energy release distributions (KERDs) for H2 loss were measured. Loss of H2 from Ti(C2H4)+ exhibited a statistical KERD with an average release (\xc4\x92t) of 0.10 eV. In contrast, V(C2H4)+ gave a statistical release for H2 loss at low source pressures (\xc4\x92t = 0.021 eV) and a strongly non-statistical release at high source pressures (\xc4\x92t = 0.70 eV). The two statistical releases were assigned to ground state Ti+(4F) and V+(5D) ions while the non-statistical release was assigned to complexes originating from the V+(3F) excited state. Modeling the statistical KERDs using phase space theory yielded the bond energies, (Ti+\xe2\x88\x92C2H2) = 51 \xc2\xb1 3 kcal/mol and (V+\xe2\x88\x92C2H2) = 41 \xc2\xb1 2 kcal/mol. Why we observe two very different KERDs in the V(C2H4)+ system at differing source pressures is discussed. The results give important information about the details of the potential energy surfaces of the two systems. "
"The ability of the serine protease subtilisin BPN\xe2\x80\x98 to catalyze peptide bond formation between fragments containing noncoded amino acids, peptide mimetics, and peptide conjugates in a kinetic approach was explored. It was found that the enzyme accepts numerous of these types of compounds both as acyl donor and acyl acceptor. The results together with specificity studies reported by others provide an active site model as a guideline in the design of enzymatic synthesis of biologically important compounds. "
"This paper is concerned with issues related to the coupling between low-ffrequency nuclear modes and electronic emission in the bacterial reaction center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. We have investigated the temporal evolution of the stimulated emission spectra of the excited state of the special pair bacteriochlorophyll dimer by means of computer simulation. To this purpose, we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations on a hydrated reaction center with the special pair in its ground and excited states, P and P*, respectively. Calculations of the time-dependent stimulated emission spectra has revealed an oscillatory behavior which is consistent with experiments (Vos et al.; Nature 1993, 363, 320; Biochemistry 1994, 33, 6750). The time scales of these nuclear vibrations are similar to those found experimentally. To a good approximation, both the protein environment and the special pair dimer couple to the P* \xe2\x86\x92 P transition with oscillations of similar frequencies. This finding offers an insight on the nature of the nuclear oscillations and might have important implications for their complete understanding. "
"Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase from Clostridium thermoaceticum was methylated such that all bound methyl groups could subsequently react with CO and coenzyme A (or OH-) to yield acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) (or acetate). Methyl groups could not bind enzyme lacking the labile Ni of the A-cluster, but could bind such samples after incubation in aqueous Ni2+, a process known to reinsert the labile Ni and reactivate the enzyme. Bound methyl groups inhibited the ability of 1,10-phenanthroline to remove the labile Ni, and the amount bound approximately correlated with the amount of labile Ni. This is strong evidence that the methyl group used in acetyl-CoA synthesis binds the labile Ni. Evidence is presented that a redox site (called the D site) other than the spin-coupled metals that define the A-cluster must be reduced before methylation can occur. Both methyl and acetyl intermediates appear to be EPR-silent. The acetyl intermediate reacted slowly with OH- to yield acetate and rapidly with CoAS- to yield acetyl-CoA. When enzyme in a state with the A-cluster reduced and bound with CO (the S = 1/2 Ared-CO state) was methylated, the resulting acetyl intermediate was also EPR-silent, indicating that the order of substrate addition had no effect on the EPR silence of the resulting acetyl intermediate. The D site appears to be an n = 2 redox agent that functions to reduce the oxidized A-cluster upon methylation and to oxidize the A-cluster as the product acetyl-CoA dissociates. D is EPR-silent in both of its oxidation states and is not any of the known metal clusters in the enzyme. D may be a special pair of cysteines coordinated to the labile Ni that can be oxidized to cystine at unusually low potentials (\xe2\x88\xbc\xe2\x88\x92530 mV vs NHE). Catalytic mechanisms that do not include D or its functional equivalent, or that employ the reduced S = 1/2 CO-bound form of the A-cluster as an intermediate, are inconsistent with the present data. A new catalytic mechanism incorporating the results of this study is proposed. "
"The acyl anion complex [(CO)2ReC(O)CH2CH2(\xce\xb75-C5H4)]-Li+ (7) in which a two-carbon tether links the cyclopentadienyl ring to the acyl carbon was synthesized by attachment of a 2-lithioethyl side chain to the cyclopentadiene ring of CpRe(CO)3 followed by intramolecular attack of the lithium reagent on a carbonyl group. Alkylation of 7 with (CH3)3O+BF4- occurred at oxygen to give the methoxycarbene complex (CO)2ReC(OCH3)CH2CH2(\xce\xb75-C5H4)(9), which was shown by X-ray crystallography to have significant strain associated with the tethered ring. Protonation of 7 gave a mixture of hydroxycarbene complex (CO)2ReC(OH)CH2CH2(\xce\xb75-C5H4) (2) and the metal acyl hydride complex trans-(CO)2HReC(O)CH2CH2(\xce\xb75-C5H4) (3). The unusual observation of the metal acyl hydride is attributed to the two-carbon tether introducing strain into the three-legged piano stool geometry of 2 but leaving the four-legged piano stool geometry of 3 relatively unstrained. In agreement with this hypothesis, no strain was apparent in the X-ray structure of the three-carbon-tethered methoxycarbene complex (CO)2ReC(OCH3)CH2CH2CH2(\xce\xb75-C5H4) (17) and only the hydroxycarbene tautomer (CO)2ReC(OH)CH2CH2CH2(\xce\xb75-C5H4) (18) was observed at equilibrium. A two-carbon tether did not introduce sufficient strain into the aminocarbene complex (CO)2ReC[NH(CH3)]CH2CH2(\xce\xb75-C5H4) (19) to allow observation of its iminoacyl hydride tautomer. "
"Ferrylmyoglobin species, which are active oxidant forms of the protein myoglobin, were obtained by electrochemical reduction of metmyoglobin [MbFeIII] in the presence of oxygen in aqueous neutral buffer and in microemulsions of oil, water, and cationic surfactant. Reduction of myoglobin at \xe2\x88\x920.4 V vs SCE catalyzed the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide at the electrode. Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes metmyoglobin in solution to give the radical ferrylmyoglobin \xe2\x80\xa2X\xe2\x88\x92MbFeIVO, which is known to decay rapidly to the non-radical MbFeIVO. This complex reduction\xe2\x88\x92oxidation process converted nearly all of the 30 \xce\xbcM myoglobin in a spectroelectrochemical cell to ferrylmyoglobins in 15 min in pH 7.3 buffer and in 18 min in microemulsions. Characteristic ferryl heme absorbance bands near 421, 548, and 584 nm were used to identify products. Confirmation of ferrylmyoglobins was provided by reductions to metmyoglobin with ascorbate and by myoglobin-mediated electrochemical epoxidation of styrene. Fiftyfold higher yields of styrene oxide and benzaldehyde were achieved in a microemulsion compared to electrochemical or chemical methods in pH 7.4 buffer. The electrochemical approach described may also prove useful for investigating active catalytic species of heme enzymes such as cytochrome P450. "
"The attachment of two polyethylene glycol tails (n = 7, MW = 350) to ruthenium tris(bipyridine) via ester links on the 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-positions of one of the bipyridine ligands yields a highly viscous (\xce\xb7 \xe2\x89\x88 107 cP) molten salt (abbreviated [Ru(bpy)2(bpy(CO2MePEG350)2)](ClO4)2) that glasses at ca. \xe2\x88\x925 \xc2\xb0C. At room temperature, the ionic conductivity of the melt is sufficiently high that application of 2.4 V across the fingers of a Pt interdigitated electrode array (IDA) coated with the melt leads to the electrolytic development of serial concentration gradient microstructures of RuIII/II and RuII/I states. At the intersection of the two concentration gradients, in the interior of the coating, reaction between the RuIII and RuI states leads to ECL emission with an efficiency of 0.2% photons/electron. Cooling a concentration gradient-containing film to \xe2\x88\x9220 \xc2\xb0C under voltage bias, so as to preserve the gradient microstructure, yields a film that has an emission efficiency of 0.1%, a current and light emission response that rapidly changes with the applied voltage bias, and a diode-like current\xe2\x88\x92voltage profile with a ca. 100 rectification ratio. "
"Catalytic CO oxidation on Pt(111) to CO2 was studied under atmospheric pressures of CO and O2 and at various temperatures. Surface vibrational spectroscopy by sum frequency generation was used to probe the surface species, while the reaction rate and gas composition were simultaneously monitored by gas chromatography. Correlation between the turnover rates and the surface coverage of various CO species were utilized to identify the active CO species in the reaction. Ignition, above which the reaction becomes self-sustained, divides the reaction into two reactivity regimes. Below ignition, atop bonded CO appears as the major species on the surface, but the reaction rate is inversely proportional to the surface coverage of this species, indicating that it is not the active species but rather an inhibitor. The observed activation energy for the reaction in this regime suggests that desorption of atop CO is the rate-limiting step in the reaction. Above ignition, the atop CO becomes hardly detectable and the activation energy reduces to the one directly associated with the reaction energy barrier between adsorbed CO and O on Pt. In all cases, the reaction rate is linearly proportional to the surface coverage of CO adsorbed at non-registry sites or defect (or distorted) surface sites. They are therefore identified as the active CO species in this surface catalytic reaction. "
"We describe here a new method for extracting the activation energy for the formation of any fragment or reactively scattered ion that forms from a parent ion\xe2\x88\x92surface collision. Our model is developed from first principles for collision-induced dissociation in the gas phase and then modified for surface-induced dissociation (SID). This approach is conceptually similar to that used for threshold collision-induced dissociation measurements in that it assumes a similar functional form for the dissociation cross section, it takes into account the partitioning of energy between the projectile and the target, and it deconvolutes these over the kinetic energy distribution of the parent ion beam. The activation energy is extracted by an analysis of the energy-resolved mass spectra and the kinetic energy distribution spectra for the surface-scattered ions. We test our method by determining the activation energies for the formation of the SiMe2+, SiMe+, SiD+ and Si+ fragment ions from the d9-SiMe3+ parent ion scattered off a hexanethiolate self-assembled monolayer adsorbed on Au(111). The differences between the literature and SID activation energies are rationalized by consideration of the experimental uncertainty in the method. "
"The identity carbon-to-carbon proton transfers between nitromethane and nitromethide anion and between oxygen protonated nitromethane and aci-nitromethane have been studied by ab initio methods. Group charges calculated by Mulliken and NPA methods as well as geometrical parameters such as pyramidal angles and CN bond lengths indicate that the transition states of these reactions are strongly imbalanced. Further evidence for the imbalance comes from a consideration of the relative energies of the various corners representing hypothetical intermediates on More O\'Ferrall\xe2\x88\x92Jencks diagrams. Our results for the CH3NO2/CH2NO2- system, in conjunction with previous findings on other CH3Y/CH2Y- systems, indicate an increase in the imbalance in the order CN \xe2\x89\xaa CHO \xe2\x89\xa4 CHCH2 \xe2\x89\xa4 NO2 consistent with the notion that imbalances increase with \xcf\x80-acceptor strength of Y. However, when comparing the CH3N+O2H/CH2NO2H system with the CH3NO2/CH2NO2- system, the results are somewhat ambiguous as to whether the stronger \xcf\x80-acceptor (N+O2H) leads to a stronger imbalance. In contrast to numerous observations in solution reactions, there is no simple relationship between reaction barrier and imbalances in the gas phase, as becomes apparent when comparing our results with those for the systems CH3CHO/CH2CHO-, CH3CHO+H/CH2CHOH, CH3CN/CH2CN-, and CH3CHCH2/CH2CHCH2- reported in the literature. It is shown that the dependence of the barriers on the \xcf\x80-acceptor is the result of a complex interplay among resonance/imbalance effects, inductive/field effects, and electrostatic/hydrogen bonding effects. "
"We performed ab initio molecular orbital (MO) calculations of the response kernel (\xe2\x88\x82Qa/\xe2\x88\x82Vb), which represents the response of the intramolecular charge polarization by external electrostatic field, on the basis of the coupled perturbed Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock equation. The response kernels of some organic molecules including pyrazine, pyrazinyl radical, acetone, and 2-hydroxypropyl radical were calculated along the present formulation. The results revealed that the hydrogen abstraction of pyrazine causes the product radical to be remarkably deformable in the partial charge distribution, while the hydrogen abstraction of acetone does not induce such enhancement of the charge sensitivity. The augmented sensitivity does not appear in the usual polarizability for a uniform field but emerges for a local fluctuated field. To elucidate the remarkable difference, we performed the normal mode analysis and decomposition based on the intrinsic soft MO pairs or localized orbitals. As a result, the enhancement in the aromatic species is attributed to the softest normal mode due to the \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x83 mixing that facilitates the deformation of the \xcf\x80-electron orbitals. In the nonaromatic species, on the other hand, this effect is not dominant and is canceled by the breakdown of hyperconjugation. We suggest that the particular sensitivity of aromatic radicals is the origin of anomalously slow diffusion in solution. "
"Chemists have always derived their knowledge about chemical reactions by inductive learning from observations on a series of individual chemical reactions. Predictions of the products of chemical reactions are made by analogy. With the availability of large reaction databases this process can be automated. In this paper a new method based on a Kohonen neural network and physicochemical variables for describing reaction centers is developed for this purpose. The results with two reaction datasets show how a set of chemical reactions with the same reaction center can automatically be classified, clearly revealing different levels of similarities of the reactions under investigation. The relative positions of reactions and clusters in the two-dimensional Kohonen map offer extra chemical information. A third reaction dataset is used to show how a trained Kohonen network can be used to predict reaction types for organic reactions. "
"The electrical and superconducting properties of hexagonal alkali tungsten bronzes AxWO3 (A = K, Rb, Cs) were examined by calculating the electronic band structure of a representative hexagonal tungsten bronze and analyzing reported crystal structures of AxWO3 (A = K, Rb, Cs). These bronzes possess one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional Fermi surfaces. The metal-to-semiconductor-to-metal transitions and superlattice reflections in KxWO3 and RbxWO3 are explained by a charge density wave (CDW) associated with the 1D Fermi surface. There occurs a maximum in the plots of the CDW onset temperature TB versus x for KxWO3 and RbxWO3. The presence of this maximum and the absence of a CDW in CsxWO3 reflect the balance of two opposing energy factors, the electronic instability and lattice stiffness, in forming a CDW. The dependence of the superconducting transition temperature TC on x suggests that a CDW transition removes lattice phonons conducive for superconductivity. "
"It is shown that the syn(N),syn(O)- isomer (3) is the intermediate on the reaction path for interconversion between the syn(N),anti(O)- (1) and syn(O),anti(N)- (2) diastereomers of syn(Me)-[Co(Mecyclen)(S-AlaO)]2+ and [Co(cyclen)(S-AlaO)]2+. 1H-exchange rate constants for the various NH protons are reported (kH/M-1 s-1, 25 \xc2\xb0C, D2O) and are correlated with the derived isomerization rate constants (kN/M-1 s-1, 25 \xc2\xb0C, H2O). At equilibrium (25 \xc2\xb0C, I \xe2\x88\xbc 0.1 M) the [1]:[2]:[3] ratios are 73:21:6 and 63:32:5, respectively, for the two complexes. Ratios of kH/kN show that the two \xe2\x80\x9cplanar\xe2\x80\x9d sec-N centers of the coordinated cyclen ligand are particularly susceptible to inversion, with estimated k2 values for lone pair inversion being between 5 \xc3\x97 106 and 2 \xc3\x97 108 s-1 at 25 \xc2\xb0C. The effects of long-range electronegative substituents (trans carboxylate-O, trans amine-N) and CNC bond angle strain on inversion at metal-coordinated amines is discussed. "
"During the epoxidation of allylbenzene, chloroperoxidase (CPO) is converted to an inactive green species in which the prosthetic heme has been modified by addition of the alkene plus an oxygen atom (Dexter, A. F.; Hager, L. P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 817\xe2\x88\x92818). We have used Q-band continuous wave and pulsed electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy to study the CPO heme in situ following inactivation with allylbenzene, using samples prepared in natural isotopic abundance, with 15N-labeled enzyme, and with allylbenzene labeled with 2H or 13C in specific vinylic positions. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of the inactivated enzyme is dominated by a low-spin ferric signal (g1,2,3 = 2.32, 2.16, 1.95). 14,15N ENDOR examination of allylbenzene-inactivated CPO reveals that three nitrogens of the heme are similar, but the fourth nitrogen is markedly different, suggesting that a single pyrrole ring has been covalently modified at the unique nitrogen. These studies also reveal the orientation of the g tensor relative to the heme. 13C ENDOR of allylbenzene-inactivated CPO with 13C-labeled allylbenzene shows that the C-1 and C-2 carbons of allylbenzene are covalently connected to the heme system. 1,2H ENDOR plus mass analysis of CPO heme after inactivation with deuterated allylbenzene show that all three vinylic protons are retained in the heme adduct. No strongly-coupled exchangeable protons are observed, indicating that the axially bound water of frozen native CPO has been displaced. The 1H at the C-2 position of the alkene shows strong, mostly isotropic hyperfine coupling while the two hydrogens at the C-1 position show weak, dipolar couplings. The hyperfine tensors of 1,2H of the C-1 position of allylbenzene have been determined, and give the position of these atoms relative to the heme. These data, combined with molecular modeling calculations, have been used to deduce that the allylbenzene-bound heme of inactivated CPO is an N-alkylhemin metallocycle with C-1 of allylbenzene bonded to the pyrrole nitrogen and to obtain metrical details of its structure.

"For the mixed-valent chromophore, (NC)5OsII\xe2\x88\x92CN\xe2\x88\x92RuIII(NH3)5-, spin\xe2\x88\x92orbit coupling and ligand-field asymmetry effects lead to multiple visible region intervalence (metal-to-metal) charge transfer transitions (Forlando et al. Inorg. Chim. Acta 1994, 223, 37). The higher energy transition is associated with transfer from an Os 5d\xcf\x80 orbital that is nominally orthogonal to the charge transfer axis. The lower energy transition, on the other hand, involves a degenerate pair of Os 5d\xcf\x80 donor orbitals directed along the charge transfer axis. Low-temperature electronic Stark effect measurements of the partially resolved transitions permit donor-orbital-specific one-electron-transfer distances to be directly evaluated. The distances, R, are remarkably dependent upon donor orbital orientation (R(parallel) = 2.8 \xc2\xb1 0.2 \xc3\x85; R(orthogonal) = 4.0 \xc2\xb1 0.4 \xc3\x85) and significantly shorter than simple geometric estimates (5.0 \xc3\x85). From the distance information, donor-orbital-specific coupling energies and solvent reorganization energies can also be estimated. These also differ substantially from those obtained by equating the charge transfer distance with the geometric donor/acceptor separation distance. "
"We have created self-assembled disk-like aggregates of predictable stoichiometry which form discotic liquid crystalline phases. Attempts to assemble multiple molecules of one compound radially about a second acting as a template failed, presumably owing to the existence of a stable crystalline phase of the template. This difficulty was obviated by the choice of tetrakis(n-alkoxy)-6(5H)-phenanthridinones (1a\xe2\x88\x92c), which were expected to form disk-like dimers by analogy with pyridones. All three of these compounds form columnar hexagonal liquid crystalline phases as shown by DSC, POM, and X-ray diffraction experiments. Infrared measurements show that 1a\xe2\x88\x92c exist as hydrogen-bonded aggregates to temperatures well above their clearing points. Intercolumnar spacing and density considerations require the discotic entities to be dimers. "
"This paper describes a simple, microscale method for generating and evaluating libraries of derivatives of poly(acrylic acid) (pAA) that present mixtures of side chains that influence their biological activity. The method is based on the one-step conversion of poly(acrylic anhydride) (pAAn) to linear polymers presenting multiple units of R on side chains, pAA(R):\xe2\x80\x89 the polymers are obtained by ultrasonication of a suspension of pAAn and aqueous RNH2 contained in a 250-\xce\xbcL well of a microtiter plate. Using this method, derivatives of pAA having N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc-L-NH2) as a side chain, pAA(NeuAc-L), were generated and assayed for ability to inhibit hemagglutination (HAI) of chicken erythrocytes by influenza virus A (X-31); the constant ( ) describing this inhibition is calculated on the basis of the concentration of NeuAc groups in solution, rather than the concentration of polymer molecules. Co-polymeric pAA(NeuAc-Ln; Ln = different linking groups) with a range of mole fractions of NeuAc-L-NH2 (\xcf\x87NeuAc-L = 0.02\xe2\x88\x920.11) exhibited HAI activities with values between 27 and 0.30 \xce\xbcM. Using combinations of NeuAc-L-NH2 and one of 26 different primary amines RNH2, a variety of ter-polymeric pAA(NeuAc-L; R) (\xcf\x87NeuAc-L \xe2\x88\xbc 0.05; \xcf\x87R \xe2\x88\xbc 0.06) were also generated and assayed. Certain ter-polymers yielded values of that were lower by a factor of \xe2\x88\xbc104 than that of the parent co-polymeric pAA(NeuAc-L):\xe2\x80\x89 the most active inhibitor was pAA(NeuAc-L; l-3-(2\xe2\x80\x98-naphthyl)alanine)) ( \xe2\x89\x88 0.5 nM). Typically, the incorporation of hydrophobicespecially aromaticside chains enhanced activities. These polymers (pAA(NeuAc-L; R)) belong to a new class of polymeric, polyvalent sialosides that are potent inhibitors of the adsorption of influenza virus to erythrocytes. They were active with only low to moderate levels of incorporation of functional groups into the side chains:\xe2\x80\x89 \xcf\x87NeuAc-L \xe2\x88\xbc 0.05; \xcf\x87R \xe2\x88\xbc 0.06. "
"A new amino acid, dysiherbaine (1), was isolated from a Micronesian sponge Dysidea herbacea. The structure was determined by using FABMS, ESIMS, FABMS/CID/MS, and one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments of 1 and its dimethyl derivative 3 to be a novel diamino dicarboxylic acid, which consisted of a cis-fused hexahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyran ring substituted with a 3-[2-aminopropanoic acid] side chain. The relative configuration of the bicyclic portion of 1 was determined by 3JH,H analysis and difference NOE experiments, and that of the acyclic side chain was assigned by additional 2,3JC,H analysis, measured by hetero half-filtered TOCSY (HETLOC) and phase sensitive HMBC experiments. Systemic administration of 1 induced neurotoxic symptoms in mice which were reminiscent of neuroexcitatory amino acids such as domoic acid. Dysiherbaine inhibited bindings of [3H]-kainic acid (KA) and [3H]-1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), but not [3H]CGS-19755, an N-methyl-d-asparatic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist, on rat brain synaptic membranes, suggesting that 1 is a selective agonist of non-NMDA type glutamate receptors in the central nervous system.

"Anthracenebisresorcinol derivative 1 as an organic network material shows a novel catalysis in the solid state for the acrolein\xe2\x88\x92cyclohexadiene Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reaction. The suggested mechanism involves a catalytic cycle composed of sorption of the reactants in the cavities of polycrystalline host 1, preorganized intracavity reaction, and desorption of the product. The host also promotes stereoselective intracavity reactions for alkyl acrylates and cyclohexadiene but, in this case, not in a catalytic manner. Relevance of the present system as a functional organic analog of zeolites is discussed in light of the kinetics of respective elementary processes and the effects of pulverization of the catalyst thereupon as well as X-ray crystal structures.

Most reactions proceed with both high yield and high stereospecificity (retention of configuration). \xce\xb2-Substituents which have been employed in this study are iodine, bromine, fluorine, benzoate, ethylcarbonate, and phthalimide. \xce\xb2-Substituents bearing powerful electron-releasing groups such as alkoxy or amino render the vinyl triflone unreactive.

"An efficient total synthesis of enantiomerically pure (\xe2\x88\x92)-dendrobine (1) is accomplished based on an \xce\xb1-carbonyl radical cyclization reaction. (S)-carvotanacetone (6) was converted to bicyclic acetal-enone 4 in five steps. CuI-mediated conjugate addition of 4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butynylmagnesium chloride to 4 followed by treatment with TMSCl afforded trimethylsilyl enol ether 10. Iodination of 10 with NaI and m-CPBA gave iodoketone 3. Intramolecular radical cyclization of 3, effected with Bu3SnH and AIBN, furnished tricyclic ketone 2. Removal of the TMS group of 2 and oxidation of the resulting cyclic acetal 12 with m-CPBA and BF3 etherate gave peroxy compound 13. Compound 13 was treated with DBU to yield lactone 14. Hydroboration of 14 with basic H2O2 oxidation gave diol 17. Conversion of 17 to the corresponding azido alcohol 19 followed by Jones oxidation furnished azido ketone 20. Treatment of 20 with PPh3 followed by reduction with NaBH3CN afforded amine 21. Crude amine 21 was methylated to give enantiomerically pure (\xe2\x88\x92)-dendrobine (1). "
"The structures of the 2-alkoxy-5(4H)-oxazolones derived from 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-[(benzyloxycarbonyl)amino]-1-oxypiperidine-4-carboxylic acid and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-[(9\xe2\x80\x98-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)amino]-1-oxypiperidine-4-carboxylic acid have been solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The overall geometry of their oxazolone ring compares well with that of 2-alkyl-5(4H)-oxazolones. However, the bond distance from C2 to the exocyclic O(2) atom is shorter than expected for a (sp2)C\xe2\x88\x92O single bond, thus suggesting a significant involvement of a O(2) lone pair in the electron delocalization of the CN \xcf\x80-system. These two structures represent the first examples of 2-alkoxy-5(4H)-oxazolones in the crystal state. Ab initio molecular orbital calculations have been performed on (4S)-2-methoxy-4-methyl-5(4H)-oxazolone and (4S)-2,4-dimethyl-5(4H)-oxazolone [as simple models for 2-alkoxy- and 2-alkyl-5(4H)-oxazolones, respectively, derived from the chiral protein amino acid l-Ala] both in the neutral and deprotonated state. The calculated geometries of the 2-alkoxy- and 2-alkyl-5(4H)-oxazolone systems at the MP2/6-31+G(d,p) level agree well with those experimentally determined in the crystal state. The calculated energetics of deprotonation show only modest differences between the two systems. Conversely, a theoretical investigation of the reaction of model oxazolones with ammonia as a nucleophile indicates that for 2-alkoxy-5(4H)-oxazolones the activation energy of the rate-determining step is significantly lower and the overall stabilization energy is larger than for 2-alkyl-5(4H)-oxazolones. The implications of these results with respect to coupling and racemization of urethane-protected amino acids in peptide synthesis are outlined. "
"Tetrakis(N,N-dimethylhydroxylamido)silane, Si(ONMe2)4 (1), and the analogous ethyl compound, Si(ONEt2)4 (2), have been prepared by the reaction of silicon tetrachloride with 4 equiv of the corresponding lithium N,N-dialkylhydroxylamide. The compounds have been characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy of the nuclei 1H, 13C, 15N [including the determination of 1J(29Si15N) coupling constants], 17O, and 29Si, and nominal and high-resolution mass spectrometry. A crystal structure determination on 1 showed the molecule to be (4 + 4)-coordinate with short Si\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N contacts [2.514(3)\xe2\x88\x922.555(3) \xc3\x85] and narrow SiON angles [109.1\xc2\xb0 on average]. For comparison, the crystal structure of the isoelectronic Si(OCHMe2)4 (in situ grown crystal) was determined, showing the absence of \xce\xb2-donor interactions and an SiOC angle of 124.7(1)\xc2\xb0. Ab initio calculations have been performed on the model compounds Si(ONH2)4 and H3SiONMe2 as well as the electronegatively substituted fluoro derivatives FH2SiONMe2 and F3SiONMe2 up to the MP2/6-311G** level of theory. Si(ONH2)4 is predicted to adopt C2 symmetry and to have an SiON angle of only 109.5\xc2\xb0, while the interactions in the other model compounds are predicted to be much stronger, as indicated by their SiON angles:\xe2\x80\x89 H3SiONMe2 102.5\xc2\xb0, FH2SiONMe2 90.0\xc2\xb0, and F3SiONMe2 93.8\xc2\xb0. The results are discussed with respect to the consequences of enlargement of the coordination sphere at the silicon atom, the unique chemical behavior of O-silylhydroxylamines (in particular their fast nucleophilic substitutions reactions), and the resulting use of this class of compounds in the silicone rubber industry.

"Rapid scan Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and time-resolved single wavelength infrared (IR) spectroscopy have been applied to study the mechanism of photochemical release of adenosine 5\xe2\x80\x98-triphosphate (ATP) from its P3-[1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl] ester (caged ATP). Bands arising from phosphate and non-phosphate vibrations characteristic of the aci-nitro anion intermediate and from free ATP and byproducts of the nitrophenylethyl group have been assigned using 13C, 15N, and 18O isotopomers of caged ATP. Monitoring several of these bands using time-resolved single frequency IR spectroscopy confirms that release of ATP occurs in a single exponential process synchronous with the decay of the aci-nitro anion intermediate. Spectral characteristics of the reaction products arising from the 1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl group in the absence and presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) have been determined. The major final byproduct from photolysis conducted in the presence of DTT is 3-methylanthranil. The mechanism of formation of this compound from 2-nitrosoacetophenone has been investigated in detail by a combination of spectroscopic, kinetic, and chemical methods and reconciled with earlier data. The byproduct species likely to be present on the time scale of most biological experiments using caged compounds is 2-hydroxylaminoacetophenone as a mixture of ring-chain tautomers. "
"A major advance has been made in the incremental molecular design of long-lived cobalt(II) dioxygen carriers. Preceding mechanistic studies revealed that ionizable methyl groups trigger the autoxidation of the O2 adduct of the cobalt(II) cyclidene. Two members of a new family of unsubstituted (no methyl groups) lacunar cyclidene dioxygen carriers have been prepared in an eight-step synthesis, and a complex with a hexamethylene bridge has been structurally characterized. In contrast to previously studied cyclidenes, these materials bear no substituents on the chelated macrocyclic platform. As anticipated, the rates of autoxidation of these unsubstituted cyclidene complexes were found to be 5\xe2\x88\x928 times slower than those for the most stable previously known cyclidene derivatives. Because of the absence of Me\xe2\x88\x92Me vicinal repulsion, the C6 bridge assumes a zig-zag conformation directly across the cavity. The accompanying, relatively low, dioxygen affinity is explained on the basis of electronic and steric factors. The rates of dioxygen binding to these newly prepared cobalt(II) unsubstituted cyclidenes are fast and approximately equal to the corresponding values for their Me-substituted analogs. Consequently, differences in dissociation rates are responsible for the differences in O2 affinities. This is a clear example of an unusual steric effect for O2 adducts. "
"Cationic rhenium dihydrogen complexes, [Re(H2)(PR3)2(CO)3]B(Ar\xe2\x80\x98)4 (PR3 = PCy3, PiPr3, PiPrPh2, PPh3; Ar\xe2\x80\x98 = 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3), have been prepared by the protonation of ReX(PR3)2(CO)3 (X = H, CH3) with [H(Et2O)2]B(Ar\xe2\x80\x98)4 under a hydrogen atmosphere. Deuterium is incorporated into the H2 ligand when placed under a D2 atmosphere and large JHD values (30\xe2\x88\x9233 Hz) are consistent with a dihydrogen formulation. Relaxation data indicate very short T1min for these complexes. These complexes are susceptible to heterolytic cleavage of dihydrogen, and the reactivity with several bases has been investigated. Under vacuum or argon atmosphere the complexes readily lose hydrogen to form 16-electron complexes. In the solid state, [Re(PCy3)2(CO)3]B(Ar\xe2\x80\x98)4 exhibits an agostic interaction to a \xce\xb2 C\xe2\x88\x92H bond of the phosphine ligand. Variable-temperature 31P{1H} NMR spectra of [Re(PCy3)2(CO)3]B(Ar\xe2\x80\x98)4 indicate a dynamic process involving hindered rotation about the Re\xe2\x88\x92P bond. Competition studies have been conducted, and the hydrogen binding affinity is higher for [Re(H2)(PCy3)2(CNtBu)3]B(Ar\xe2\x80\x98)4 (5) than for [Re(H2)(PCy3)2(CO)3]B(Ar\xe2\x80\x98)4 (2a). Similar experiments also find that 5 also binds hydrogen preferentially over W(H2)(PCy3)2(CO)3. "
"Variable-temperature magnetic circular dichroism (VT MCD) is used as a probe of the ground-state electronic structure in Co(II)-substituted liver alcohol dehyrogenase, carbonic anhydrase, carboxypeptidase, substrate and inhibitor complexes of these enzymes, and four- and five-coordinate Co(II) model complexes. VT MCD was used to determine the magnitude of the ground-state zero-field splitting (ZFS) in these samples. The four-coordinate Co(II) species had ZFS\'s that ranged from 2.3 to 30 cm-1 and the five-coordinate species had ZFS\'s that ranged from 2.7 to 98 cm-1, values which fall outside of the ranges previously suggested for distinguishing 4-coordinate and 5-coordinate Co(II) (Makinen, M. W.; Kuo, L. C.; Yim, M. B.; Wells, G. B.; Fukuyama, J. M.; Kim, J. E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985, 107, 5245\xe2\x88\x925255). The magnitude of the ZFS is not very sensitive to ligand heterogeneity but can be very sensitive to bond angles. Since protein active sites are in general highly angularly distorted from ideal four- or five-coordinate geometries, ZFS is rendered useless as a sole indicator of coordination number in Co(II)-substituted proteins. The MCD and absorption (or diffuse reflectance) spectra and the values of the ZFS for the proteins and model compounds are used in angle overlap method (AOM) calculations. These calculations support the conclusion that there is significant overlap in the ranges of ZFS for four- and five-coordinate Co(II) compounds. "
"Our efforts to model the oxygen activation chemistry of nonheme iron enzymes have yielded transient intermediates with novel properties. These properties can be dramatically affected by the introduction of a 6-methyl substituent on the pendant pyridines of the tetradentate ligand TPA (TPA = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine). A series of Fe(TPA) complexes has thus been synthesized and characterized to provide the structural basis for these dramatic effects. The following complexes have been obtained:\xe2\x80\x89 [Fe(L)(CH3CN)2](ClO4)2 (1, L = TPA; 2, L = 6-MeTPA; 3, L = 6-Me2TPA; 4, L = 6-Me3TPA) and [Fe(L)(acac)](ClO4)2 (5, L = TPA; 6, L = 5-Me3TPA; 7, L = 6-MeTPA). As indicated by 1H NMR and/or EPR, 1, 5, and 6 with no 6-methyl substituent are low spin, while complexes 2, 3, 4, and 7 with at least one 6-methyl substituent are all high spin, with higher redox potentials than their low-spin counterparts. The ligands with 6-methyl substituents thus favor a metal center with a larger ionic radius, i.e., FeII over FeIII and high spin over low spin. Careful scrutiny of the crystal structures of 1, 4, 6, and 7 reveals that one hydrogen of the 6-methyl group is only 2.7 \xc3\x85 away from the metal center in the high-spin complexes. Its presence thus prevents the pyridine nitrogen from forming an Fe\xe2\x88\x92N bond shorter than 2.1 \xc3\x85 as required for an iron center to adopt a low-spin configuration. This steric effect of the 6-methyl substituent serves as a simple but very useful ligand design tool to tune the electronic properties of the metastable alkylperoxoiron(III) species derived from the reactions of 1\xe2\x88\x924 with tert-butyl hydroperoxide. These intermediates serve as models for low-spin and high-spin peroxoiron(III) species in the reaction cycles of the antitumor drug bleomycin and lipoxygenase, respectively. Similar principles apply in the design of nonheme diiron(II) complexes that reversibly bind dioxygen and of high-valent bis(\xce\xbc-oxo)diiron complexes that model the high-valent intermediates in the redox cycles of nonheme diiron enzymes such as methane monooxygenase and ribonucleotide reductase.

"The temperature dependence of hydrophobic interactions of methane-like particles in water is analyzed in terms of free energy, entropy, internal energy, and the second osmotic virial coefficient. A large computational effort (approximately 15 ns cumulative trajectory length at each temperature) has been undertaken in order to guarantee reliable free energy and entropy data. At 300 K association is controlled by entropy, but as the temperature rises the internal energy takes over and dominates at 500 K. Both internal energy and entropy change sign within this temperature range. Our results correspond qualitatively with the experimentally observed temperature effect for transfer of gaseous hydrophobic substances into water:\xe2\x80\x89 \xce\x94A shows a weak temperature dependence, while \xce\x94E and \xce\x94S vary strongly with temperature. The second osmotic virial coefficients were calculated at different temperatures. Agreement with osmotic virial coefficients measured by solubility experiments at 300 K was found. Our results indicate that pairwise hydrophobic association studied by molecular dynamics simulation shows the key effects reported for bulk hydrophobic interactions. At present, there is no evidence for a qualitative difference between pair and bulk hydrophobic interactions. It is demonstrated that the comparison of the second osmotic virial coefficient of the solute particles in water, B2,aq, with that in the pure gas phase, B2,g, is not apppropriate for an assessment of the influence of water on pairwise hydrophobic interactions.

"Ab initio MO calculations indicate that protonation of XHn to XHn+1+ increases bond dissociation energies (BDEs) for homolytic cleavage of CX bonds in CH3XHn, CH3\xe2\x88\x92CH2\xe2\x88\x92XHn, CH2CH\xe2\x88\x92XHn, and CH\xe2\x8b\xaeC\xe2\x88\x92XHn compounds (X = N, O, F, P, S, and Cl). Deprotonation of XHn to XHn-1- (X = C, N, O, Si, P, and S) in saturated species generally results in small decreases in CX BDEs; in unsaturated substances, as a result of resonance, deprotonation yields large increases in the CX BDEs, X = Si being the exception. For adjacent CC bonds, protonation of XHn increases the CC BDEs because it produces larger electronegativity differences between bonded groups; deprotonation decreases the BDEs as a result of resonance effects. Two types of correlation between bond lengths and homolytic BDEs are observed, with second-row elements exhibiting bond length changes to a much lesser extent than first-row ones. Firstly, bond lengths of adjacent CC bonds increase as their BDEs decrease. Secondly, and apparently anomalously, CX bond lengths and homolytic BDEs both increase with protonation of XHn, except with X = P. The increase in BDE together with the increase in bond length is, in part, a result of the focus on homolytic BDEs:\xe2\x80\x89 heterolytic cleavage of most protonated, and many deprotonated, species is actually preferred, in which case bond lengths generally increase as bond strengths decrease in accordance with the normally accepted trend.

"Density functional calculations (B3LYP/6-31G(d)) are presented for the anion and radical of the mono-carbon carboranes, CBnHn+1, n = 4, 9, 11. The CB4H5-, CB9H10-, and CB11H12- anions, which are isoelectronic with the closo-dicarba species C2B3H5, C2B8H10, and C2B10H12, are predicted to have significant ionization potentials (2.88, 4.36, and 5.19 eV). The recently reported synthesis of the permethyl derivative of the CB11H12 radical is remarkable in view of the large predicted ionization potential of the CB11Me12- anion (4.32 eV). All calculated properties are consistent with the removal of an electron from a cage-bonding orbital with significant unpaired spin density on the boron opposite the carbon vertex. "
"Carbon 1s electron binding energies determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and mean dipole moment derivatives obtained from experimental infrared intensities are shown to be related through the simple potential model proposed by Siegbahn and collaborators. The sp3 carbon atoms in 13 halomethanes, 2 ethanes, 3 methylacetylenes, cyclopropane, and ethylene oxide have 1s energies, which, after correction for electrostatic potentials from neighboring atoms, are linearly related to the carbon mean dipole moment derivatives, presenting a slope of 15.50 \xc2\xb1 0.29 eV/e. The sp2 carbons of ethylene, three haloethylenes, and three carbonyl compounds also exhibit a linear relationship having a significantly different slope of 17.37 \xc2\xb1 0.87 eV/e. The sp carbon atoms in acetylenes, cyanides, CO, CS2, CO2, and OCS show a third linear relationship, with a slope of 18.90 \xc2\xb1 0.75 eV/e. These slopes are proportional to the inverse atomic radii of sp3, sp2, and sp carbon atoms and according to the simple potential equation can be interpreted as estimates of Coulomb repulsion integrals involving these hybridized orbitals and the 1s core electron orbitals. Two basic assumptions of the potential model are investigated. The effect of relaxation energies on the 1s electron ionization processes is estimated as the difference between \xce\x94SCF ionization energies and Koopmans\' frozen orbital estimates obtained from 6-31G(d,p) wave functions. These results are compared with values obtained previously from the equivalent cores estimating procedure. Also the conceptual validity of identifying the carbon mean dipole moment derivatives as atomic charges is discussed within the framework of the charge\xe2\x88\x92charge flux-overlap model. "
"Molecular orbital calculations using Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock (HF), complete active space self consistent field (CASSCF), quadratic configuration interaction with single and double excitations, and triple excitations included via perturbation (QCISD(T)) and semiempirical (AM1) methods suggest that the experimentally observed endo selectivity for the Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reaction between cyclopropene, I, and isotopically substituted butadiene, II, be mostly due to an attractive interaction between a C\xe2\x88\x92H of I and the \xcf\x80-bond between the central carbons of II, which is possible in the endo (but not exo) transition state. The relevance of this observation to other Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder endo/exo selectivities is discussed. The activation energetics for the reactions are all substantially overestimated by HF and CASSCF calculations, while QCISD(T) and AM1 give more reasonable results. Only AM1, however, fails to predict the observed preference for the endo TS. Both QCISD(T) and small basis set calculations are shown to result in large basis set superposition errors, which fortuitously lower the (uncorrected) activation energies. "
"O\xe2\x88\x92H bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of phenol, p-aminophenol, and p-nitrophenol have been computed using ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) methods. The MP2 and MP4 methods consistently overestimate the absolute BDEs but provide reasonable relative BDEs. Spin projected MP2 and MP4 energies are not able to reproduce the substituent effects on the BDE. The BLYP and B3LYP DFT methods provide more reliable and economical approaches for prediction of phenol BDEs. B3LYP/6-31G** computed \xce\x94BDEs for 10 substituted phenols have been compared with values determined by different experimental approaches. The computed values are in most cases within the uncertainty of the measurements. It is shown that the substituent effects on the BDEs can be interpreted in terms of polar and radical stabilization. The polar stabilization is found to be related to the ability of the substituent to delocalize the lone pair on the phenol oxygen. The radical stabilization is dependent on the degree of spin delocalization. A method for estimating relative polar and radical stabilization energies based on computed electrostatic potentials and spin densities is presented. "
"Calculations on phenol and a large number of phenols substituted with methyl, methoxyl, and amino groups have yielded reliable gas-phase O\xe2\x88\x92H bond dissociation energies, BDE(ArO\xe2\x88\x92H)gas. Geometries for the phenol, ArOH, and aryloxyl radical, ArO, were optimized at the (semiempirical) AM1 level followed by single point density functional theory (DFT) calculations using a 6-31G basis set supplemented with p-functions on the hydrogen atom and the B3LYP density functional. This gave BDE(PhO\xe2\x88\x92H)gas = 86.46 kcal/mol, which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 87.3 \xc2\xb1 1.5 kcal/mol. All but one of the compounds and conformations examined had weaker O\xe2\x88\x92H BDE\'s than phenol, the exception being o-methoxyphenol with the O\xe2\x88\x92H group pointing toward this substituent (BDE = 87.8 kcal/mol). Where comparison was possible, calculated differences in O\xe2\x88\x92H BDE\'s were in excellent agreement with experiment (better than 1 kcal/mol). A simple group additivity scheme also gave excellent agreement with calculated BDE (ArO\xe2\x88\x92H)gas values. Some potential new leads to phenolic antioxidants more active than vitamin E have been uncovered. "
"Geometries of the 12 possible cycloaddition products between ketenimine and acrolein as well as of the respective transition states have been obtained by ab initio calculations at the MP2/6-31G* level. Energies were obtained up to the MP4(SDTQ)/6-31+G* level. On the basis of product stability arguments, addition of the ketenimine CC double bond is more favorable than reaction of the CN double bond. Similarly, acrolein also preferentially should react via its CC rather than CO bond. In kinetically controlled reactions, however, participation of the ketenimine CN bond in [4 + 2] cycloadditions across the oxa-1,3-dienic system is comparable to (8) or far more feasible than (7) reaction of the CC bond.

"Temperature-jump relaxation magic-angle spinning NMR experiments are for the first time applied to study a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction. A temperature jump from 20 to 100\xe2\x88\x92150 \xc2\xb0C creates a nonequilibrium state of the system consisting of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), methanol, and isobutene, which are adsorbed on a boron pentasil zeolite in a sealed glass tube. The rate constants of MTBE decomposition and formation were determined, and the corresponding apparent energies of activation are 51 and 32 kJ mol-1, respectively. The NMR findings are in agreement with experimental results obtained in a fixed bed reactor or in an autoclave. "
"The resonance Raman (RR) spectrum of C70 has been studied in benzene using 11 laser excitation energies across the main visible absorption band (MVAB) of C70 between 514.5 and 406.7 nm. Raman excitation profiles (REPs) were constructed for the 15 most intense RR bands of C70, and symmetry assignments have been made partly on the basis of polarization work. Contrast is made to work performed on thin films where problems have arisen from the symmetry-lowering effect of the surface and from neglect of resonance. Assignments for nine other less intense RR bands are suggested. Three electronic transitions under the MVAB are identified and assigned definitively:\xe2\x80\x89 the HOMO \xe2\x88\x92 4 (e2\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98) \xe2\x86\x92 LUMO + 1 (e1\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98) transition in the 514/501-nm excitation region, the HOMO \xe2\x88\x92 5 (e1\xe2\x80\x98) \xe2\x86\x92 LUMO + 1 (e1\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98) transition in the 476/472-nm excitation region, and the HOMO (a2\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98) \xe2\x86\x92 LUMO + 2 (a1\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98) in the 457/452-nm excitation region. The REPs reveal that these three electronic transitions are vibronically coupled to the strong electronic transition at 382 nm which is assigned to the HOMO \xe2\x88\x92 2 (a2\xe2\x80\x98) \xe2\x86\x92 LUMO + 3 (e1\xe2\x80\x98) transition. RR B-term scattering mechanisms are the major source of intensity enhancement for bands of the totally-symmetric A1\xe2\x80\x98 and the non-totally-symmetric E1\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 and E2\xe2\x80\x98 Raman modes. The REPs of the 15 bands are grouped into four types that provide insight into the change in the electronic distribution upon excitation for each transition. Unlike C60, whose extraordinarily high symmetry makes it very sensitive to solvent-induced symmetry lowering and whose RR spectrum is rich in forbidden, overtone, and combination bands, C70 displays a restricted subset of RR scattering phenomena. The lower symmetry and more localized molecular orbitals of C70 make it a better model for the RR scattering mechanisms and vibronic coupling expected in the higher fullerenes. "
"A new protocol for the interpretation of NMR relaxation data in terms of intramolecular motion is described. At first, a long molecular dynamics simulation of the system is generated and analyzed with respect to nuclear spin relaxation-active motional modes. In a second step, an analytical model is conceived on the basis of the computational results. Finally, the model parameters are determined numerically by a least-squares fit to the experimental NMR data. This protocol was applied to the phenylalanine side-chain dynamics in the cyclic decapeptide antamanide. A 100 ns Langevin dynamics simulation was analyzed in terms of dihedral angle fluctuations, correlation functions, and potentials of mean force. For \xcf\x871 and \xcf\x872, motion in a harmonic potential is observed which is interrupted by occasional jumps between different rotamers over relatively high barriers. This behavior leads to an analytical Gaussian axial fluctuation and jump model, which is an extension of the previously proposed GAF model (Br\xc3\xbcschweiler, R.; Wright, P. E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994, 116, 8426). "
"A new class of competitive inhibitors for the cysteine protease papain is described. These inhibitors are based upon a 4-heterocyclohexanone ring and are designed to react with the enzyme active site nucleophile to give a reversibly formed hemithioketal. The electrophilicity of the ketone in these inhibitors is enhanced by ring strain and by through-space electrostatic repulsion with the heteroatom at the 1-position of the ring. Equilibrium constants for addition of water and 3-mercaptopropionic acid to several 4-heterocyclohexanones were measured by 1H NMR spectroscopy. These reactions model addition of the active site nucleophile to the corresponding inhibitors. The equilibrium constants give a linear correlation with the field substituent constant F for the functional group at the 1-position of the heterocyclohexanone. These equilibrium constants also correlate well with the inhibition constants for the 4-heterocyclohexanone-based inhibitors, which range from 11 to 120 \xce\xbcM. Thus, the model system can be used to predict the potency of structurally related enzyme inhibitors. "
"Electrochemical oxidation of the corresponding carboxylates (Kolbe reaction) offers a simple and efficient means to solidly attach a monolayer of arylmethyl groups on carbon surfaces. The starting molecules are easily accessible, and the presence of appropriate substituents on the phenyl rings makes this type of derivatization a convenient starting point for further chemical modifications. The extent of the surface modification can be followed by cyclic voltammetry as a function of the number of successive potential cycles. The presence of the groups on the surface, their arrangement, and their concentration are determined by the same technique as well as by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron tunneling microscopy after transfer of the derivatized electrode into a pure electrolyte solution. The fact that reductive and oxidative cyclic voltammograms of the derivatized electrodes can be obtained demonstrates that the grafted groups are in electrical contact with the electrode by means of electron hopping to or from the aryl moieties they contain. After the electrode has been passivated at the potential whereby anodic oxidation occurs, a second, more positive wave appears. Oxidation at the potential of this second wave triggers a further grafting process leading to a denser film. Electrochemical manipulations allow not only the attachment of electroactive films on the carbon surface but also their erasing by setting the electrode potential at a value where the attached groups are oxidized. "
"In native chemical ligation, an unprotected peptide \xce\xb1-carboxy thioester is reacted with a second peptide containing an N-terminal cysteine residue. It was anticipated that addition of thiophenol to a native chemical ligation reaction would keep cysteine side chains reduced, catalyze the reversal of unproductive thioester formation, and generate a more reactive phenyl thioester through thiol exchange. Several model peptide\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb1-thioesters were treated with an excess of a competing thiol to investigate their susceptibility to thiol exchange:\xe2\x80\x89 a highly activated 3-nitro-4-carboxybenzyl \xce\xb1-thioester was smoothly converted to the less activated benzyl \xce\xb1-thioester through the addition of an excess of benzyl mercaptan; similarly, a peptide containing the benzyl \xce\xb1-thioester group was converted to a more reactive phenyl \xce\xb1-thioester by addition of thiophenol. Even a weakly activated peptide\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb1-thioester was converted to a substantially more reactive species, as demonstrated by the conversion of peptide\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb1COS-CH2COOH to peptide\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb1COS-phenyl. The utility of in situ transthioesterification in native chemical ligation reactions was demonstrated by model syntheses of the 110-residue barnase polypeptide chain. The use of thiophenol as an additive in the ligation gave clean, rapid reaction to form the desired amide-linked product in high yield. The in situ transthioesterification process is broadly applicable to the total chemical synthesis of proteins by native chemical ligation. "
"Methyladenine and adenine N-phosphoryl derivatives of adenosine 5\xe2\x80\x98-monophosphate (5\xe2\x80\x98-AMP) and uridine 5\xe2\x80\x98-monophosphate (5\xe2\x80\x98-UMP) are synthesized, and their structures are elucidated. The oligomerization reactions of the adenine derivatives of 5\xe2\x80\x98-phosphoramidates of adenosine on montmorillonite are investigated. 1-Methyladenine and 3-methyladenine derivatives on montmorillonite yielded oligoadenylates as long as undecamer, and the 2-methyladenine and adenine derivatives on montmorillonite yielded oligomers up to hexamers and pentamers, respectively. The 1-methyladenine derivative yielded linear, cyclic, and A5\xe2\x80\x98ppA-derived oligonucleotides with a regioselectivity for the 3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-phosphodiester linkages averaging 84%. The effect of pKa and amine structure of phosphate-activating groups on the montmorillonite-catalyzed oligomerization of the 5\xe2\x80\x98-phosphoramidate of adenosine are discussed. The binding and reaction of methyladenine and adenine N-phosphoryl derivatives of adenosine are described. "
"Three different stereoisomers of a phosphatidic acid analog bearing two phosphate groups have been synthesized from tartaric acid and erythritol. The obtained diastereomeric gemini surfactants differ in their aggregation behavior due to the different spatial orientations of their functional groups. The most remarkable difference in aggregation behavior is encountered when calcium ions are added to vesicle suspensions of the respective isomers. The vesicles formed from the (S,S) and (R,R) isomer undergo fusion, whereas those of the (R,S) isomer show vesicle fission. This remarkable behavior can be explained by a change in the molecular packing of the lipid molecules upon the complexation with calcium ions. An analysis of physical data obtained prior to and after the addition of the calcium ions reveals that the head groups of the diastereomeric surfactants respond differently to these ions:\xe2\x80\x89 those of the (S,S) isomer increase in size, whereas those of the (R,S) isomer decrease in size. This phenomenon accounts for occurrence of fusion and fission of the vesicles, respectively. "
"Mono-, di-, and triprotonation of thiourea (H2N)2CS, was studied by low-temperature 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR spectroscopy in superacidic systems. In FSO3H/SO2ClF at \xe2\x88\x9280 \xc2\xb0C, thiourea is monoprotonated exclusively at the sulfur atom giving rise to [(H2N)2CSH]+. The addition of SbF5 to this system increases the acidity of the solution and results in the observation of the diprotonated species [H3NC(SH)NH2]2+. No NMR evidence was found for triprotonation under these conditions, although a limited equilibrium should not necessarily be detected. The dication was isolated as its AsF6- salt at \xe2\x88\x9264 \xc2\xb0C and decomposes at room temperature to AsF5, HF, and [(NH2)2CSH]+AsF6-. The mono- and the diprotonated AsF6- salts were characterized in the solid state by low-temperature Raman spectroscopy, and vibrational assignments are given for both cations. The experimental results and spectroscopic data were confirmed by density functional theory methods at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. Whereas the mono- and diprotonated ions are thermodynamically stable, the triprotonated ion is only kinetically stable. Deprotonation of triprotonated thiourea to the diprotonated species is exothermic by 76.3 kcal/mol but displays a high kinetic barrier (51.1 kcal/mol). "
"The diterpene (+)-epoxydictymene has been synthesized in 20 steps using the asymmetry of (R)-pulegone and several substrate-controlled diastereoselective reactions to prepare the natural product in its natural configuration. Three of the four rings were assembled with two consecutive intramolecular reactions involving dicobalt hexacarbonyl complexes of alkynes:\xe2\x80\x89 a Lewis acid-promoted Nicholas reaction and a Pauson\xe2\x88\x92Khand reaction. The construction of the strained trans-3-oxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane ring system of the natural product presented a significant challenge. To this end, several radical and anionic cyclizations were studied, the latter leading to (+)-epoxydictymene. "
A novel water-soluble photochemical microreactor has been prepared. A perbutylated cyclodextrin bearing seven naphthalenesulfonate antenna chromophores (Bu-CD-N7) displays improved solubilization of hydrophobic guests in comparison with the unbutylated material (CD-N7). The photophysical properties of Bu-CD-N7 are similar to those of the CD-N7. The naphthyl chromophores of Bu-CD-N7 were used to sensitize the photolysis of 9-anthrylmethyl pivalate (AP). Inclusion of AP in the cyclodextrin leads to the selective formation of one of the two possible coupling products. 
"Nitronyl nitroxide derivatives carrying a hydroquinone or a resorcinol moiety 2-(2\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazolyl-1-oxyl-3-oxide (HQNN) and 2-(3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazolyl-1-oxyl 3-oxide (RSNN)) have been designed and prepared. These compounds were found to afford hydrogen-bonded crystals. In the case of HQNN, two phases of crystals (\xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-HQNN) were obtained. Of these, the crystal structure of \xce\xb1-HQNN is characterized by the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the o-hydroxy group and the nitronyl nitroxide and by the intermolecular one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded chain between the o- and p-hydroxy groups of the neighboring molecules, respectively. Two of the hydrogen-bonded chains run in parallel, and they are connected by the bifurcated hydrogen bonds formed between the o-hydroxy groups of the facing molecules in the individual chain. The \xcf\x87T value of this crystal increased monotonously with lowering temperature (ST model, J = +0.93 K, \xce\xb8 = +0.46 K) and turned out to exhibit a ferromagnetic phase transition at 0.5 K. On the basis of the heat capacity data, \xce\xb1-HQNN was found to be a three-dimensional ferromagnet. On the other hand, the crystal of \xce\xb2-HQNN was characterized by the intermolecular hydrogen-bonded chain formed between the hydroxy group at the meta position and the nitronyl nitroxide and by the interchain \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 stacking. The magnetic interaction of \xce\xb2-HQNN was interpreted by the ferromagnetic ST model, and this ferromagnetic interaction (J = +5.0 K) was accompanied by a weak antiferromagnetic interaction (\xce\xb8 = \xe2\x88\x920.32 K) at lower temperatures. Although the structural feature of the crystal of RSNN resembles that of the \xce\xb2-HQNN, it exhibited the antiferromagnetic interaction predominantly (ST model, J = +10.0 K, \xce\xb8 = \xe2\x88\x924.0 K). These magnetic behaviors are consistent with McConnell\'s theory, when the spin densities at the interacting sites connected by hydrogen bonds are taken into account. Thus, it may be concluded that the hydrogen bond plays a role not only in constructing hydrogen-bonded crystals but also in transmitting spin polarization along the hydrogen bond. "
"A detailed ab initio study of the structures and energetics of the persulfoxides and thiadioxiranes derived from sulfenic acid derivatives (RSX) is reported. The persulfoxides adopt structures in which the O\xe2\x88\x92O bond bisects the RSX angle while the thiadioxiranes prefer a distorted trigonal bypyramidal geometry. The thiadioxiranes are more stable in every case than their persulfoxide isomer. The exothermicities of the interconversions of the persulfoxide to the thiadioxirane increase in the substituent (X) order CH3 < NH2 < Cl < OCH3 < SCH3 < F from a low of 3 kcal/mol to a high of 31 kcal/mol. The activation barriers, on the other hand, decrease in the substituent order Cl > CH3 \xe2\x89\x88 NH2 > OCH3 \xe2\x89\x88 SCH3 > F from 27 to 10 kcal/mol. Only those persulfoxides which do not have a hydrogen on a heteroatom X exist in well-defined minima on the potential energy surface. Attempted minimization with tight convergence criteria of persulfoxides with heteroatom X\xe2\x88\x92H bonds resulted in collapse via ene-like reactions to give hydroperoxy sulfonium ylides. In the case where X\xe2\x88\x92H is N\xe2\x88\x92H, the resulting hydroperoxysulfonium ylide (iminopersulfinic acid) adopts a hydrogen-bonded structure reminiscent of peracids. Experimental evidence for the formation of these new peroxides was obtained by photooxidations of N-methyl-, N-n-butyl-, and N-tert-butylbenzenesulfenamides. "
"An investigation of 9-ethyladenine (9-EA) imprinted polymers has provided insight into the origins of binding and recognition by imprinted polymers. Porogens and polymerization temperature are important variables during the polymerization. Factors that influence rebinding of the 9-EA imprinted polymer include pH and utilization of the porogen as mobile phase. Finally, quantitative structure\xe2\x88\x92binding relationship studies elicited the substructures of 9-EA primarily responsible for creating the binding sites within the polymers. "
"The microstructures of polypropenes produced with several zirconocene-based catalyst systems are compared, to verify the possible correlation between the type of stereospecificity and the amount of regioirregularities. It is confirmed that, while syndiospecific and aspecific zirconocenes are highly regiospecific, isospecific systems produce substantial amounts of regioirregular monomeric units. The amount of these secondary units strongly depends on the nature of the \xcf\x80-ligands and on the type of the bridge connecting them. Molecular mechanics calculations are reported, indicating that the intermediates which are energetically suitable for the secondary and primary insertions, for isospecific or syndiospecific complexes, coordinate monomer enantiofaces of the opposite or the same chirality, respectively. This difference accounts for the lower regiospecificity of the isospecific catalytic complexes, assuming that the energy barrier for the rotation of the coordinated monomer around the metal\xe2\x88\x92olefin bond, between the orientations suitable for the primary and secondary insertions is lower than (or comparable to) the activation energy for secondary monomer insertion.

"Treatment of tungsten\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb71-\xce\xb1,\xce\xb4- and \xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb71-\xce\xb1,\xce\xb5-alkynols 4\xe2\x88\x926 with RCHO/BF3\xc2\xb7Et2O (R = alkyl, aryl) in cold diethyl ether effected cycloalkenation reaction, yielding tungsten\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb71-furylidene and \xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb71-pyrylidene salts in excellent yields (>95%). The structures of these oxacarbeniums were elucidated through X-ray diffraction studies of the representative compounds 7 and 8 in addition to standard NMR and IR spectral data. In contrast with conventional metal carbeniums, these tungsten oxacarbeniums reacted with two molecules of nucleophiles such as H2O, NaBH3CN, and Grignard reagents, resulting in \xce\xb1,\xce\xb1-double addition reactions to afford furan and pyran derivatives in good yields. In the hydride case, unsymmetric \xce\xb1,\xce\xb1-double addition of \xce\xb71-furylidenium salts was achieved via treatment with NaBH4/MeOH. Organocuprates also effected double alkylations of these salts but in a distinct 1,3-addition pathway. The reactions of these oxacarbeniums with CH2N2 were examined; the outcome depends on their vinyl substituents. When the substituent is an aliphatic group, the carbenium species undergo highly diastereoselective cyclopropanation with CH2N2. For an aryl substituent, the reaction with CH2N2 yielded a new tungsten oxacarbenium with a significantly altered structure; in this case 13C- and 2H-labeling experiments were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

"A new chiral phosphine\xe2\x88\x92phosphite ligand, (R)-2-(diphenylphosphino)-1,1\xe2\x80\x98-binaphthalen-2\xe2\x80\x98-yl (S)-1,1\xe2\x80\x98-binaphthalene-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-diyl phosphite [(R,S)-BINAPHOS, (R,S)-2a], was synthesized. Its Rh(I) complex was prepared, and its structure has been characterized by 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy. Using Rh(I) complexes of (R,S)-2a and its enantiomer, highly enantioselective hydroformylation of styrene has been performed (94% ee, iso/normal = 88/12). The catalyst system was also effective for a variety of other olefins. Some other phosphine\xe2\x88\x92phosphite ligands bearing 1,1\xe2\x80\x98-binaphthyl and biphenyl backbones, such as (S)-3,3\xe2\x80\x98-dichloro-6-(diphenylphosphino)-2,2\xe2\x80\x98,4,4\xe2\x80\x98-tetramethylbiphenyl-6\xe2\x80\x98-yl (R)-1,1\xe2\x80\x98-binaphthalene-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-diyl phosphite [(S,R)-BIPHEMPHOS, (S,R)-5a], (R,R)-2a, (R,S)-2b, (R)-2c, and (R)-5b, were tested for asymmetric hydroformylation. The results indicate that the sense of enantioface selection for the prochiral olefins is mainly determined by the absolute configuration of the phosphine site, for example, the (R)-2-(diphenylphosphino)-1,1\xe2\x80\x98-binaphthalen-2\xe2\x80\x98-yl group in (R,S)-2a. The relative configurations of the two biaryl groups in the phosphine\xe2\x88\x92phosphites play crucial roles in the degree of the enantioselectivities, that is, the (R*,S*)-isomer generally gives products in high ee\'s and the (R*,R*)-isomer does in low ee\'s. Treatment of Rh(acac)[(R,S)-2a] with a 1:1 mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen gave a hydridorhodium complex, RhH(CO)2[(R,S)-2a], as a single species. Trigonal bipyramidal structure is suggested for this complex, in which the hydride and the phosphite moiety are located at the apical positions and the phosphine and the two carbonyls occupy the equatorial positions. The interchange of the phosphine and the phosphite sites with each other through rapid pseudorotations has not been observed in RhH(CO)2[(R,S)-2a]. The structural deviations of the monohydride complexes from an ideal trigonal bipyramid seem to be larger in (R*,R*)-isomers than in the corresponding (R*,S*)-isomers. The existence of only one active species involved in the Rh(I)\xe2\x88\x92(R,S)-2a-catalyzed hydroformylation has been manifested by the plot of ln([R]/[S]) of the hydroformylation product vs the reciprocals of the reaction temperatures. The higher thermodynamic stability of Rh(acac)[(R,S)-2a] than its diastereomer Rh(acac)[(R,R)-2a] is demonstrated in relation to the restricted configuration of (R)-2c to (R,S)-2c in its complex formation with Rh(I).

A method for the transformation of o-allyl aryl ketones to \xce\xb3-butyrolactones using a catalytic amount of Cp2Ti(PMe3)2 or Cp2Ti(CO)2 is described. This catalytic \xe2\x80\x9chetero Pauson\xe2\x88\x92Khand\xe2\x80\x9d-type process proceeds via the carbonylation of an oxatitanacycle followed by thermally-induced reductive elimination to form a \xce\xb3-butyrolactone and to regenerate the catalyst. We have investigated the scope and limitations of this catalytic methodology. Our results are consistent with the view that the key step in this catalytic cycle is formation of a charge transfer complex or involves reversible electron transfer between the catalyst and the substrate. 
"The mechanism of the rhodium-catalyzed hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid was investigated by initial rate measurements using the complex [(dppp)Rh(hfacac)] (A) (dppp = Ph2P(CH2)3PPh2, hfacac = hexafluoroacetylacetonate) as a catalyst precursor in DMSO/NEt3 and by ab initio calculations using cis-[(H3P)2Rh] as a model fragment for the catalytically active site. The kinetic data are consistent with a mechanism that involves rate limiting product formation by liberation of formic acid from an intermediate that is formed via two reversible reactions of the actual catalytically active species first with CO2 and then with H2. The calculations provide for the first time a theoretical analysis of the full catalytic cycle of CO2 hydrogenation. They give detailed insight into the structure of possible intermediates and their transformations during the individual steps. The results suggest \xcf\x83-bond metathesis as an alternative low energy pathway to a classical oxidative addition/reductive elimination sequence for the reaction of the formate intermediate with dihydrogen.

"The cal-ad analysis of HZSM-5 provides a novel characterization of the donor-acceptor properties of this solid acid showing 0.0415 mmol per g of a strong Br\xc3\xb6nsted site and 0.53 mmol per g of a weaker site. Of all studies to date, only cal-ad provides a measure of the extent, Ki; strength, \xe2\x88\x92\xce\x94Hi; and quantity of sites. The relative K values show why gas phase calorimetry, TPD, TGA, DSC, and isopropylamine decomposition do not resolve the two sites found by cal-ad and incorrectly suggest 0.6 mmol g-1 of strong acid sites. Reaction with pyridine gives an enthalpy of 42.1 and 8.6 kcal mol-1, respectively, for the two sites suggesting the latter is a hydrogen bonding site. Other acidity measures average these sites, and their enthalpies contain dispersion as well as donor-acceptor components. Comparison of these results with other cal-ad results suggests HZSM-5 is a strong solid acid but not a super acid. Titrations with 2,6-lutidine and 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine indicate that the strong Br\xc3\xb6nsted sites are located in the 5.5 \xc3\x85 channels with no detectable amounts on the exterior surface.

"Treatment of CpMoCl2(\xce\xb7-C4H6) (1) with 1 equiv of allylmagnesium bromide yields the dinuclear complexes [CpMo(\xce\xb7-C4H6)(\xce\xbc-Br)]2 (2, major) and Cp2Mo2(\xce\xb7-C4H6)2(\xce\xbc-Br)(\xce\xbc-Cl) (3, minor). A solid solution of compounds 2 and 3 adopts an anti geometry in the solid state, as shown by X-ray crystallography, whereas both anti and syn isomers are observed in benzene solution by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The reaction of 1 with 2 equiv of allylmagnesium bromide yields [CpMo(\xce\xb7-C3H5)(\xce\xb7-C4H6)] as an equilibrium mixture of a major (98%, 4a) and a minor (2%, 4b) isomer. NOE\xe2\x88\x92NMR studies indicate the CpMo(prone-C3H5)(supine-C4H6) orientation for the major isomer 4a, which is also found in the solid state by X-ray crystallography. The orientation of 4b is suggested by the 1H-NMR chemical shifts as CpMo(supine-C3H5)(supine-C4H6). Oxidation of 4a/b by ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate in dichloromethane gives the 17-electron compounds [CpMo(\xce\xb7-C3H5)(\xce\xb7-C4H6)][PF6] (5a/b). The green compound 5a converts into the more stable red-violet 5b with an estimated half-life of <20 s in THF. It can be observed, however, at low temperature by EPR spectroscopy. The [CpMo(supine-\xce\xb7-C3H5)(supine-\xce\xb7-C4H6)][PF6] configuration for 5b has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction methods. Upon reduction with cobaltocene, 5b is converted selectively to 4b, followed by slow equilibration (t1/2 = 6.5 h) with 4a. Refluxing or photolyzing a solution of 4a/b in benzene generates a third isomer, 4c, which adopts a CpMo(supine-C3H5)(s-trans-C4H6) configuration as confirmed by an X-ray analysis. The distribution of 4a and 4c at equilibrium is approximately 1:1 by starting either from 4a/b or from pure 4c and independent of the equilibration method (thermal/photochemical). Oxidation of 4c generates the corresponding 1-electron oxidation product 5c, which rapidly isomerizes to 5b. It can be observed, however, by EPR in THF together with a fourth isomer, 5d (ca. 1:1), believed to differ from 5c only in the orientation of the allyl ligand. Equilibrium, rate, and electrochemical data allow most of the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters related to the transformation of the different compounds to be sorted out. The faster s-trans- to s-cis-butadiene isomerization for 5 relative to 4 indicates the easier accessibility of the unsaturated 15-electron vs 16-electron intermediate. Possible reasons for this trend are analyzed. "
"For a series of Mn\xe2\x88\x92Cl coordination complexes the chlorine K-edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) have been measured to probe chloride\xe2\x88\x92manganese bonding. Results show that in a series of mononuclear (single Mn) compounds with Cl covalently bound to Mn, the intensity of the pre-edge feature increases in the order MnII < MnIII < MnIV. For a series of distorted cubane complexes (containing 4 Mn) with bridging and terminal Cl ligands, three pre-edge features are seen. The pre-edge peak at lowest energy increases in intensity as more terminal Cl are included in the compounds. The origin of these features in the edge spectra is described in terms of the symmetry and ligand field splittings expected for the Mn complexes. The Mn model systems studied here have potential application to the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) in Photosystem II (PSII), where direct structural evidence for a halide binding site on the Mn cluster in one or more S-states of the Kok cycle would be informative.

"The intermediate electron acceptor of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center, which is a pheophytin-\xce\xb1 (Pheo) molecule, was studied by pulsed EPR. Electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) experiments were carried out in 14N- and 15N-labeled PSII reaction centers. The assignment of the ESEEM frequencies was achieved by the application of three-pulse (stimulated echo) and four-pulse 2D-HYSCORE sequences. Computer simulations of the 14N- and 15N-stimulated ESEEM spectra were performed, yielding a complete set of hyperfine and quadrupole coupling constants of the four nitrogens of the macrocycle of the pheophytin. The nitrogen hyperfine couplings are characterized by considerable anisotropy while the isotropic part is either smaller or much larger than the nuclear Larmor frequency. The present results show that the spin density distribution on the Pheo- in PSII is highly asymmetric. In agreement with earlier theoretical predictions for Pheo- in vitro, the ESEEM data show that in PSII the two unprotonated nitrogens bear considerable spin density while the protonated nitrogens bear a small fraction of the spin density.

"Interactions of water and methanol with a mixed valence Mn(III)Mn(IV) complex are explored with 1H electron spin echo (ESE)-electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and 1H and 2H ESE envelope modulation (ESEEM). Derivatives of the (2-OH-3,5-Cl2-SALPN)2 Mn(III)Mn(IV) complex are ideal for structural and spectroscopic modeling of water binding to multinuclear Mn complexes in metalloproteins, specifically photosystem II (PSII) and manganese catalase (MnCat). Using ESE-ENDOR and ESEEM techniques, 1H hyperfine parameters are determined for both water and methanol ligated to the Mn(III) ion of the complex. The protons of water directly bound to Mn(III) are inequivalent and exhibit roughly axial dipolar hyperfine interactions (Tdip = 8.4 MHz and Tdip = 7.4 MHz), permitting orientations and radial distances to be determined using a model where the proton experiences a point dipole interaction with each Mn ion. General equations are given for the components of the rhombic dipolar hyperfine interaction between a proton and a spin coupled dinuclear metal cluster. The observed ENDOR pattern is from water protons 2.65 and 2.74 \xc3\x85 from the Mn(III) which make an Mn(IV)\xe2\x88\x92Mn(III)\xe2\x88\x92H angle of \xe2\x88\xbc160\xc2\xb0. For the alcohol proton in the analogous methanol bound complex, a 2.65 \xc3\x85 Mn(III)\xe2\x88\x92H distance is observed. Three pulse 2H ESEEM gives best fit Mn(III)\xe2\x88\x922H(1H) radial distances of 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 \xc3\x85 for the three methyl deuterons in this complex. "
"A series of linear and branched high-spin di- and tri(cation radical)s (12\xe2\x80\xa22+, 72\xe2\x80\xa22+, 33\xe2\x80\xa23+, 43\xe2\x80\xa23+, and 93\xe2\x80\xa23+) has been prepared by oxidation of the corresponding meta\xe2\x88\x92para aniline oligomers. The oligo(cation radical)s are stable under ambient conditions. The formation and properties of the cation radicals has been studied in detail by cyclic voltammetry and UV\xe2\x88\x92vis\xe2\x88\x92near IR spectroscopy. ESR spectroscopy has provided the zero-field splittings, which are consistent with the topology of the molecules and the localization of the unpaired electrons. Variable temperature ESR measurements reveal that the signal intensity follows Curie\'s law, consistent with a low-energy high-spin state. The stability of the high-spin meta\xe2\x88\x92para aniline oligomers and the possibility to extend these systems demonstrate that alternating meta and para aniline oligomers are promising building blocks for future polaronic ferromagnets.

"Organic solutions of poly-\xce\xb3-(benzyl-l-glutamate) (PBLG) generate a sufficient differential ordering effect (DOE) to discriminate enantiomers using proton decoupled carbon-13 NMR in natural abundance. Discrimination between enantiomers is observed through the carbon-13 chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) differences. This method is successfully applied to a large number of chiral molecules including a case of axial chirality and offers the advantage that no labeling or chemical modification of molecules is needed. In most cases, the chemical shift differences are large enough to measure the enantiomeric excess with accuracy. We show that this new tool is an attractive and powerful alternative to the existing enantiomeric analytical techniques. "
"A series of eight thermal cheletropic decarbonylations show dramatic differences in reaction pathways and in activation energies depending on the molecular orbital topology, as calculated by using ab initio molecular orbital theory (MP2(FC)/6-31G* optimized geometries and MP4/D95** + ZPE single point energies). The decarbonylations of 3-cyclopentenone (1) and bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene-7-one (3) are pericyclic, orbital symmetry allowed reactions, but it is argued that the decarbonylation of cyclopropanone (9), although formally orbital symmetry allowed, lacks an energy of concert and thus is \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively forbidden\xe2\x80\x9d. The carbon monoxide produced from 1 is predicted to be formed vibrationally cool and rotationally hot. Fragmentations of 2,3-furandione (5) and 2,3-pyrroledione (7) are pseudopericyclic reactions with two orbital disconnections, proceed via planar transition structures, and have activation energies that are much lower than expected for pericyclic reactions of comparable exothermicity. It will be an experimental challenge to determine if the carbon monoxide product from each of these is formed with little vibrational or rotational excitation as predicted. Fragmentations of 3H-furan-2-one (11), 3-cyclopentene-1,2-dione (13), and 3-methylene-3H-furan-2-one (15) each have a single disconnection. Strong bonding at the orbital disconnection in the transition structure tends to lower the barrier and give the reaction more pseudopericyclic character. "
"Molecular oxygen forms a reversible charge transfer complex (CTC) with poly(3-alkylthiophenes). The complex is weakly bound but possesses a distinct absorption band in the visible region. The electronic properties of the neutral polymer are modulated by the CTC. The extent of modulation of these properties is proportional to oxygen pressure and is fully reversible. Analysis of poly(3-hexylthiophene) field effect transistors under increasing pressures of oxygen shows that the carrier concentration increases, conductivity increases, and the charge carrier mobility is lowered by the formation of the charge transfer complex. The CTC manifests itself as a fluorescence quencher of mobile polaronic excitons, and it explains why oxygen quenches luminescence with much greater efficiency than predicted by a collisional quenching model. Implications of the charge transfer complex on the photochemistry of poly(3-alkylthiophenes) and photosensitization of singlet oxygen are discussed. "
"The acid-catalyzed racemization and regioisomerization of (S)-trans-4-hexen-3-ol (1S) has been investigated in gaseous CH4 and C3H8 at 720 Torr and in the 40\xe2\x88\x92120 \xc2\xb0C temperature range. The contribution to the racemization and isomerization products by free 1-methyl-3-ethylallyl cations, arising from unimolecular fragmentation of excited O-protonated (S)-trans-4-hexen-3-ol (IS), was evaluated by generating them from protonation of isomeric 2,4-hexadienes and by investigating their behavior toward H218O under the same experimental conditions. The rate constant of the gas phase racemization of IS (1.4\xe2\x88\x9221.3 \xc3\x97 106 s-1) was found to exceed that of its isomerization (1.0\xe2\x88\x929.9 \xc3\x97 106 s-1) over the entire temperature range. The experimental results, combined with ab initio theoretical calculations on the model [C3H5+/H2O] system, are consistent with a gas phase intramolecular IS racemization and isomerization involving the intermediacy of structured ion\xe2\x88\x92molecule complexes, wherein the H2O molecule is coplanarly coordinated to the hydrogen atoms of the 1-methyl-3-ethylallyl moiety. The rate of formation of these structured complexes, their relative stability, and the dynamics of their evolution to the racemized and isomerized products depend, in the gas phase, on the specific conformation of IS. The relevant activation parameters point to transition structures wherein a substantial fraction of the positive charge is located on the allyl moiety. The results obtained in the present gas phase investigation confirm previous indications about the occurrence and the role of intimate ion\xe2\x88\x92molecule pairs in acid-catalyzed racemization and isomerization of optically active alcohols, including allylic alcohols, in solution.

"The kinetic conclusions of a recent report by Maxwell and Tsanaktsidis (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 4276) were investigated. The kinetics of ring opening of the (N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl radical (2) to the N-butyl-4-pentenaminyl radical (1) and the reverse reaction, 5-exo cyclization of 1 to 2, were determined at 50 and 80 \xc2\xb0C by competitive Bu3SnH trapping. Rate constants for 5-exo cyclization of a dialkylaminyl radical and for \xce\xb2-fragmentation of a \xce\xb2-(dialkylamino)ethyl radical were measured by direct laser flash photolysis (LFP) methods. In contrast to the conclusions of Maxwell and Tsanaktsidis, all of these radical reactions were facile with rate constants of at least 1 \xc3\x97 104 s-1. The claim by Maxwell and Tsanaktsidis that bis(tributyltin oxide) catalyzes dialkylaminyl radical reactions was investigated by LFP kinetic studies of the 5-exo cyclization of the N-methyl-5,5-diphenyl-4-pentenaminyl radical (20) in the presence of the additive which demonstrated that (Bu3Sn)2O does not have a catalytic effect on the reaction. Computations of the energies of the N-methyl analogs of radicals 1 and 2 with a high level of theory (fourth-order M\xc3\xb8ller\xe2\x88\x92Plesset perturbation theory) and by a hybrid density functional theory with a very large basis set indicate that the cyclization reaction is expected to be slightly exergonic at 298 K. This work demonstrates that the kinetic results reported by Maxwell and Tsanaktsidis were spurious. We speculate that impurities of dichalcogens in their radical precursor samples were reduced by Bu3SnH to highly reactive chalcogen hydrides (arylthiols and benzeneselenol) in their kinetic studies.

"A versatile method for the synthesis of complex, fused polycyclic aromatic systems in high chemical yield is described. Construction is achieved using a general two-step synthetic sequence. Pd-catalyzed Suzuki and Negishi type cross-coupling chemistries allow for the preparation of nonfused skeletal ring systems in yields consistently >80%. The critical ring-forming step, which generally proceeds in very high to quantitative yield, utilizes 4-alkoxyphenylethynyl groups and is induced by strong electrophiles such as trifluoroacetic acid and iodonium tetrafluoroborate. The reaction in essence produces phenanthrene moieties which are integrated into extended polycyclic aromatic structures. Fused polycyclic benzenoids as well as benzenoid/thiophene systems may be prepared utilizing this methodology. The scope of the described cross-coupling/cyclization chemistry including mechanistic insights and problematic side reactions are described. "
"The protonation of ammonium ions NR4+ (R = H, CH3) to form the corresponding protioammonium dications HNR42+ (R = H, CH3) was investigated by hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments and by ab initio molecular orbital calculations. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange was observed by 2H NMR spectroscopy at the CH3 groups of tetramethylammonium ion N(CH3)4+ when reacted with excess DF:SbF5 superacid. On the basis of calculational results, the intermediacy of the corresponding C\xe2\x88\x92H-protonated protiotetramethylammonium dication (CH3)3NCH42+ is suggested to account for the observed exchange. Under similar conditions, no exchange was observed in the parent ammonium ion NH4+ in FSO3D:SbF5 superacid, although the NH52+ dication was calculated to be kinetically stable with a considerable barrier to deprotonation. The pentafluoroammonium dication NF52+ was also investigated theoretically, and the results were compared to those of neutral NF5. "
"The cyanide-assisted demetalation kinetics of four molecular dicopper(I) trefoil knots, related face-to-face constitutional isomers and of a double-stranded helical knot\'s precursor, have been investigated by single-wavelength and multiwavelength absorption spectrophotometry in order to gain insight into the particular properties induced by interlacing four 1,10-phenanthroline chelating units. The nonentangled face-to-face and helical dinuclear complexes are demetalated according to a two consecutive, bimolecular rate-limiting step mechanism. In each case, both coordination sites are structurally equivalent and dissociate in an almost statistical way, reflecting weak interactions between them. In contrast, the knotted topology is responsible for a strong coupling as evidenced by the one and two rate-limiting step processes found for the methylene- and phenylene-bridged knots, respectively. This result has been rationalized in terms of molecular rearrangements of the knotted structure following the release of the first copper(I) cation. Hence, the coordination sphere becomes either more accessible to the entering cyanide anion and the mononuclear intermediate dissociates in a fast second step or highly protecting, leading to an inert mononuclear species in the case of the phenylene-bridged knot. The 9 orders of magnitude span of the second-order demetalation rate constants reflects the versatile structural parameters around the copper(I) center. They are primarily affected by the steric hindrance of the substituents in the 2,9-positions of the phenanthroline nuclei and by the topology of the complex. Compared with their face-to-face analogues, the methylene-bridged knots are about 100 times more inert as a result of the helicoidal arrangement of the internal spacer in the core of the molecule. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters are sensitive to even more subtle structural variations, like the length of the internal and external spacers. "
"In this paper, we summarize three ligand design studies performed using the program SMoG, which was developed in our lab. The aim of this presentation is to communicate through examples the potential of this method:\xe2\x80\x89 the richness of the molecules that can be developed and the ease with which they are found. In particular, we present suggestions for ligands to Src SH3 domain (specificity pocket and LP site) and CD4. "
"Small isolated clusters of alkali halides and analogous divalent species composed of closed-shell atomic ions are known to prefer densely packed structures similar but not identical to the repeat units found in the solid state. Beyond the simple cube structure that occurs, for example, in alkali halide tetramers, no other ionic polyhedral structures containing only atomic ions are known. In this article, we explore the possibility of other three-dimensional structures, and we show computationally that two molecules, Mg2Al4O8 and Na4Mg4O6, have very stable distorted rhombic dodecahedron structures. We therefore suggest that a wide variety of stable polyhedral structures could be constructed from ions, and we offer a simple electrostatic model for predicting which polyhedral ionic structures should be stable and which should not. We point out that several recently observed inorganic solid state materials contain core structures that fit our predictions. "
"This paper reports detailed synthesis and characterization of a hybridized polymer system which combines the ionic transition metal complexes and a conjugated polymer backbone bearing NLO chromophores to manifest a large photorefractive (PR) effect. In this system, the conjugated polymer backbone was chosen to play the dual role of a transporting channel for the charge carriers and a macroligand to chelate with the transition metal complex. Ru(II)\xe2\x88\x92tri(bispyridyl) complexes were chosen as the photocharge generator by utilizing their metal-to-ligand charge transfer properties. The Heck coupling reaction was applied to synthesize these multifunctional polymers. A large net optical gain (>200 cm-1) at a zero electric field was observed on poled samples. The synthetic approach is versatile and was extended to the synthesis of PR polymers containing Os complexes. The resulting polymer showed photorefractivity at a wavelength in the near IR region (780 nm). This approach also offers the opportunity to fine-tune the electronic properties of polymers through modification of the polymer structures. Model reactions were studied to elucidate the structural defects caused by the side reactions in the Heck reaction. The effects of these defects on the PR performance of these polymers were evaluated. It was demonstrated that eliminating these defects could enhance the photorefractive response time. "
"The oriented growth of p-nitroaniline and hydroquinone deposited from the vapor phase on monooriented thin films of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) prepared by friction transfer is investigated by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and polarized FTIR spectroscopy. Due to the formation of two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded networks, both aromatic compounds crystallize with a layered structure. p-Nitroaniline is found to contact the (100)PTFE surface with its (101)PNA crystallographic plane which is parallel to the hydrogen-bonded sheet. A similar PTFE/hydrogen-bonded sheet interface was never observed for \xce\xb3-hydroquinone crystals vacuum deposited under similar experimental conditions. In fact, hydroquinone orients on PTFE with a (110)HYD or (11\xcc\x840)HYD contact plane. Reconstruction of the PTFE substrate at the substrate/deposit interface is invoked as a tentative explanation of the difference in orientational behavior of these two organic compounds. "
"The stabilities of all possible purine/pyrimidine pairings between the isomeric nucleobases isocytosine (iso-C) and isoguanine (iso-G) and standard genomic bases are reported for two independent oligonucleotide duplexes. Additionally, results are given from ab initio calculations performed on iso-C and iso-G. The calculations are used as an aid in the interpretation of thermodynamic data obtained from duplex denaturation studies. The unnatural iso-C/iso-G pair is found to be as stable as a C/G Watson\xe2\x88\x92Crick pair in both duplex systems. The next most stable unnatural pair is that formed by C/iso-G and is observed to be isoenergetic with a U/A Watson\xe2\x88\x92Crick pair. Ab initio data suggest iso-G may adopt an unprecedented imino oxo tautomer which could explain the unusual stability of the C/iso-G pair. The stability of the other possible unnatural pairs are reported and similarly interpreted in terms of ab initio and other available experimental data. Finally, the fitness is discussed of a six-component genetic system that includes iso-C, iso-G, and four standard genomic bases. "
"The neutral and cationic aminotroponiminate derivatives of germanium(II) have been investigated. The treatment of GeCl2\xc2\xb7(1,4-dioxane) with [(i-Pr)2ATI]Li or [(Me)2ATI]Li in a 1:1 molar ratio gave the corresponding monochloro germanium(II) complex. Substitution of the chloride ion of [(i-Pr)2ATI]GeCl with weakly coordinating anions [CF3SO3]- and [(\xce\xb75-C5H5)ZrCl2(\xce\xbc-Cl)3ZrCl2(\xce\xb75-C5H5)]- led to cationic germanium(II) species containing {[(i-Pr)2ATI]Ge}+ ion. Although NMR data of the cationic species show notable differences relative to their neutral analog, the solid state data show only minor changes in the C7N2Ge moiety. The Ge\xe2\x88\x92N bond distances of the cations are not indicative of significant Ge\xe2\x88\x92N \xcf\x80-bonding. These compounds feature some of the smallest N\xe2\x88\x92Ge\xe2\x88\x92N angles known for Ge(II) compounds. Attempted synthesis of the tetraphenylborate salt of {[(Me)2ATI]Ge}+ led to a phenyl group transfer product [(Me)2ATI]GePh\xc2\xb7BPh3 with a Ge(II)\xe2\x88\x92B bond. Details of the 1H, 13C NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystal structures of all these compounds are described. "
The reaction between tert-butylphosphonic acid and an equimolar quantity of LiGaMe4 in THF and n-hexane (1:1) yields the first molecular lithium gallium phosphonate Li4[(MeGa)6(\xce\xbc3-O)2(t-BuPO3)6]\xc2\xb7(THF)4 (1) in 70% yield. Compound 1 has been fully characterized by means of analytical and spectroscopic techniques as well as a single crystal X-ray diffraction study. Compound 1 represents the first molecular ionic gallophosphonate cage which contains coordinated lithium ions in the form of a one-dimensional wire and can be regarded as a potential precursor for the subsequent synthesis of molecular sieves and ion conductors. Compound 1 is unreactive toward air and moisture at room temperature. Treatment of 1 with D2O even at 70 \xc2\xb0C does not lead to the hydrolysis of the Ga\xe2\x88\x92C bonds. Treatment of a benzene-d6 solution of 1 with 12-crown-4 followed by D2O leads to the facile conversion of the product into the neutral cubic gallium phosphonate cage [t-BuPO3GaMe]4 (2). 
"Single crystals of a recently prepared, at room temperature non-luminescent, linear-chain \xce\xb1-uranyl phenylphosphonate (\xce\xb1-UPP), [UO2(HO3PC6H5)2(H2O)]2\xc2\xb78H2O, transform at room temperature and moderate humidity into a new strongly luminescent linear-chain \xce\xb2-uranyl phenylphosphonate (\xce\xb2-UPP), UO2(HO3PC6H5)2(H2O)\xc2\xb72H2O. Both compounds have also been synthesized separately and characterized by single-crystal methods. The \xce\xb1-phase crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1\xcc\x84, with a = 11.724(4) \xc3\x85, b = 16.676 \xc3\x85, c = 11.375 \xc3\x85, \xce\xb1 = 101.61(5)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb2 = 106.76(3)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb3 = 102.57(4)\xc2\xb0, and Z = 2, whereas the \xce\xb2-phase crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c with a = 7.766(2) \xc3\x85, b = 11.255(2) \xc3\x85, c = 20.959(4) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 100.38(3)\xc2\xb0, and Z = 4. In both compounds, the coordination of the uranium atoms is pentagonal bipyramidal, and the metal-to-phosphonate ratio is 1:2. The most obvious difference between the two linear-chain compounds is the manner in which their phenyl rings are arranged. When viewed along the appropriate axes, phenyl rings of \xce\xb1-UPP arrange in two rows in a cis conformation, whereas those of \xce\xb2-UPP arrange in two rows in a trans conformation. The suggested mechanism of transformation consists of breaking a U\xe2\x88\x92Oequatorial bond, followed by a rotation of a phenylphosphonate group. During this rotation, the protonated phosphonate oxygen is deprotonated by one of the lattice water molecules and the detaching phosphonate oxygen is protonated. The deprotonation appears to be the rate-determining step of the transformation, not the U\xe2\x88\x92Oequatorial bond breaking. The linear uranyl phenylphosphonate chains remain uninterrupted during the phase transformation process, but they shift and rearrange to form a different lattice as their shape changes from cis to trans.

"The first evidence of insertion of isocyanide into M\xe2\x88\x92S bond has been demonstrated. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium [Pd(PPh3)4] catalyzes the reaction of a disulfide (ArS)2 (1) with an isocyanide ArNC (2) (Ar = 4-MeC6H4) to produce the adducts (ArS)(CNAr)m(SAr). The reactions of 1:m adducts with 2 are also catalyzed by the Pd complex to afford 1:k adducts (k \xe2\x89\xa0 m). The mechanistic study reveals that the complex Pd(SAr)2(CNAr)(PPh3) (8) is a resting state for giving 1:1 adduct and converted into 1:1 adduct 3 (m = 1) in the presence of another 1 equiv of 1. The stoichiometric reaction of 3 with Pd(PPh3)4 provides 8, but the stoichiometric oxidative addition of 1:m adducts (m = 2, 3, 4) to Pd(PPh3)4 did not give any definitive Pd(II) species. These facts reveal that both the insertion of isocyanide(s) into Pd\xe2\x88\x92S bond and the reductive elimination of 1:m adduct are reversible. The study on reactivities of isocyanide and thiolate ligands on platinum, including the X-ray crystallographic analysis of the imidoyl platinum trans-Pt[(CNAr)2SAr](SAr)(PPh3)2 (21) obtained by the oxidative addition of the C\xe2\x88\x92S bond of 1:2 adduct 4 (m = 2) to Pt(PPh3)4 has also been reported.

"An upper bound for the adiabatic electron affinity of cyclopentadienylcobaltdicarbonyl [CpCo(CO)2] is 0.86 \xc2\xb1 0.2 eV as determined by fixed-frequency negative-ion photoelectron spectroscopy. During the course of the experimental work, the generation of the binuclear complex [CpCo(CO)2]2- is detected, and, to our knowledge, this is the first observation of this anionic cluster. Electronic structural calculations using both the density functional theory formalism and ab initio techniques are completed for both CpCo(CO)2 and the corresponding negative-ion. A DFT/DZVP2 calculation yields the vertical electron affinity of CpCo(CO)2 as 0.84 \xc2\xb1 1.0 eV. The theoretical results confirm that a weak \xe2\x80\x9callyl-ene\xe2\x80\x9d type structure exists in the cyclopentadienyl ligand of both molecules, but the distortion is less pronounced in CpCo(CO)2- than in CpCo(CO)2. Our results lend further support to the classification of CpCo(CO)2- as a 19-electron complex. "
"The method of collision-induced dissociation threshold analysis for determining carbene thermochemistry is applied to the ground-state triplet carbenes CH2 (methylene, 1), CH2CHCH (vinylcarbene, 2), and PhCH (phenylcarbene, 3). The chief aims of this study are to evaluate the energetic and dynamical consequences of the obligatory curve-crossing that characterizes dissociation of a halide ion from an \xce\xb1-halocarbanion to form a carbene with a triplet ground state, and to determine accurate heats of formation for 2 and 3. Threshold collision energies for loss of halide from CH2X- (X = Cl, Br), CH2CHCHX- (X = Cl, Br, I), and PhCHX- (X = Cl, Br, I) are determined with use of a flowing afterglow\xe2\x88\x92triple quadrupole apparatus. The dissociation energies are combined with the measured gas-phase acidities of the corresponding methyl, allyl, and benzyl halides in simple thermochemical cycles in order to derive the absolute heats of formation for the carbenes. The value of \xce\x94Hf,298(1) derived from the results for the two different methyl halides (92.2 \xc2\xb1 3.7 kcal/mol) is in excellent agreement with the well-established literature value for the triplet ground state of methylene:\xe2\x80\x89 \xce\x94Hf,298[X\xcc\x83 3B1 CH2] = 92.9 \xc2\xb1 0.6 kcal/mol. The good agreement indicates that dissociation of the halomethyl anions occurs adiabatically to produce the triplet state of the product without any significant reverse activation energy or dynamical constraints. The measured dissociation energies for 1-chloro-, 1-bromo-, and 1-iodoallyl anions are combined with the bracketed acidities of allyl chloride, bromide, and iodide to yield three independently determined but closely matched values for \xce\x94Hf,298(2):\xe2\x80\x89 92.3 \xc2\xb1 2.6, 93.9 \xc2\xb1 3.4, and 93.2 \xc2\xb1 3.1 kcal/mol, respectively. The average value from the three determinations, 93.3 \xc2\xb1 3.4 kcal/mol, is in fair agreement with the estimated heat of formation for the triplet ground state of 2 obtained from various MCSCF and density functional calculations (90 kcal/mol), but much lower than the predicted heat of formation for the lowest singlet state of 2 (100 kcal/mol). As with the halomethyl ions, efficient adiabatic dissociation of the haloallyl anions at the thermodynamic limit is indicated by these results. The apparent heats of formation for 3 derived from the measured dissociation energies for PhCHCl-, PhCHBr- and PhCHI-, and the bracketed acidities of the corresponding benzyl halides show a somewhat larger (non-systematic) variation, but are all within the assigned uncertainties. The derived values for \xce\x94Hf,298(3) are 103.2 \xc2\xb1 3.2, 105.5 \xc2\xb1 2.7, and 100.9 \xc2\xb1 2.8 kcal/mol for the benzyl chloride, bromide, and iodide systems, respectively, giving an average value of 102.8 \xc2\xb1 3.5 kcal/mol. The measured heats of formation for 2 and 3 are compared with the predictions obtained from various levels of ab initio theory. Density functional calculations with the BVWN5 and B3LYP functionals in conjunction with polarized, triple-\xce\xb6 basis sets are found to perform best with respect to the singlet\xe2\x88\x92triplet splittings and absolute heats of formation, while MCSCF and CISD methods lead to S\xe2\x88\x92T gaps and heats of formation that are too high. The experimental thermochemistry is used to derive values for the \xce\xb1-CH bond strengths in allyl radical and benzyl radical:\xe2\x80\x89 DH298[CH2CHCH\xe2\x88\x92H] = 104.0 \xc2\xb1 3.4 kcal/mol and DH298[PhCH\xe2\x88\x92H] = 105.2 \xc2\xb1 3.5 kcal/mol.

"Stable, nanometer-scale thickness films of \xe2\x88\x92(CH2)x\xe2\x88\x92 have been observed to form by the surface-catalyzed decomposition of CH2N2 on evaporated Au film substrates. In the early stages, growth occurs in the form of isolated clusters at defect regions in the {111} textured surfaces. As the average thickness increases beyond \xe2\x88\xbc20 nm, growth spills out onto the {111} terraces with eventual coverage of the entire surface. At all coverages, the dominant structure is highly trans, extended polymethylene chains packed in an orthorhombic lattice, similar to the typical structure of crystalline, bulk-phase polyethylene but containing more conformational defects than well-formed bulk crystals. Chain melting occurs at \xe2\x88\xbc135 \xc2\xb0C, and cooling to room temperature results in differing extents of ordering as a function of the total film coverage, an indication that the structures of the growing films are constrained in metastable forms by the presence of adjacent gold surface defect features. The polymerization mechanism appears to involve surface-catalyzed decomposition of the diazomethane at gold defect sites to produce methylidene adsorbate species, which subsequently initiate the formation of linear polymers via a free radical propagation process. This process provides a useful limiting case of the surface-catalyzed formation of linear hydrocarbons from C1 intermediates on transition metals. "
"Calculations at the MP2/6-31G*//MP2/6-31G* level show there are concerted asynchronous pathways connecting protonated propene oxide and protonated propanal. With cleavage of the C\xe2\x88\x92O bond of protonated propene oxide, the preference for rotation of oxygen away from the more hindered face of the oxirane plane containing the methyl group is quantified as 2 kcal/mol. This pathway involves two distinct steps; first, rupture of the oxirane and, second, hydride migration. The latter does not commence until rupture of the C\xe2\x88\x92O bond is complete. The combination of these two steps defines a concerted asynchronous rearrangement pathway. The reaction is predicted to show a 20:1 preference for migration of the proton trans to the methyl over the cis. "
"The preferred orientation and conformation of biologically active [d-Ala2]- and inactive [l-Ala2]Met-enkephalins have been studied by liquid-crystal NMR spectroscopy employing magic-angle- and near-magic-angle-spinning (MAS/NMAS) two-dimensional methodology. The solvent employed was a CsPFO (cesium perfluorooctanoate) liquid crystal so that less proton signals interfere with the spectrum under the MAS/NMAS conditions. The conformation and orientation of [d-Ala2]- and [l-Ala2]Met-enkephalins were determined in this anisotropic environment from the analysis of the 1H\xe2\x88\x921H direct couplings obtained under the NMAS condition and of the 1H\xe2\x88\x921H ROE factors obtained under the MAS condition. These data were analyzed by the minimization based on pseudoenergy analysis. The results showed that the preferred orientations and the motional restrictions of the tyrosine residues of Met-enkephalin analogues are perpendicular to each other, although the preferred conformations are extended ones for both compounds. Also it is revealed from the NMR analysis that the tyrosine residue is much embedded in the liquid-crystal aggregates for the inactive analogue in contrast to the active one. The interaction between the membrane and the tyrosine residue is pointed out to relate to the activity of enkephalin. "
"At 95 GHz, deep electron spin echo envelope modulations of a single crystal of the blue copper protein azurin have been observed. The modulations arise from the coordinated nitrogens of the histidines that ligate to copper. From the ESEEM frequencies, hyperfine and quadrupole tensors of these nitrogens have been deduced. The isotropic hyperfine coupling of the copper-bound nitrogen of histidine-117 is 1.4 times larger than that of histidine-46. The anisotropic hyperfine tensors show that the wave function of the unpaired electron on both coordinated nitrogens mainly concerns the \xcf\x83 bonds with copper. "
"Three resting state horseradish peroxidase isozymes (HRPC, HRPA1, and HRPA2) have been investigated by solution 1D and 2D NMR to determine the scope and limitation of these methods for large (\xe2\x88\xbc44 kDa), high-spin ferric heme enzymes and to develop an interpretive basis of the hyperfine shifts in terms of the molecular and electronic structure of the active site. Definitive assignments are attained for the resolved heme and axial His resonances, as well as several residues more than 7 \xc3\x85 from the iron. Four Phe side chains located in HRPC by scalar correlation and characteristic NOEs to the heme are identified as Phe 152, Phe 172, and two unassigned Phes X and W, in contact with pyrrole D. The temperature dependence of the hyperfine shifted aromatic rings shows that dipolar shift arises from zero-field splitting; a value of D \xe2\x88\xbc 7 cm-1 models the observed dipolar shift with use of a homology model constructed from peanut peroxidase. The combined use of steady-state NOEs, paramagnetic relaxation, and the predicted dipolar shifts based on the homology model led to the assignment of parts of the distal Arg 38 and Phe 41. However, the remainder of the active site signals are strongly relaxed but only weakly dipolar shifted, precluding assignment of other protons <7 \xc3\x85 from the iron. While the 1D/2D NMR approaches are not as effective in high-spin resting state HRP as for low-spin cyanide-inhibited HRP, several residues could be assigned in the former that were not located in the latter because both the residue and heme contact signals are lost under the diamagnetic envelope. With all heme signals resolved, HRP allows probing of the peripheral environment for all four pyrroles. Comparison of the hyperfine shift pattern among natural HRP isozymes reveals that the different shift magnitudes reflect variations in the extent of admixing of S < 5/2 spin states to the predominant high-spin ground state. The binding of the substrate benzhydroxamic acid to HRPC is shown to lead to altered hyperfine shifts that reflect an increase of the zero-field splitting and demonstrates that the binding of the substrate, in contrast to previous proposals, is not accompanied by ligation of a water at the sixth position. It is also concluded that the available methods are sufficient to allow definitive NMR studies of the peripheral substrate binding site in HRP. "
"We have used pressure\xe2\x88\x92area isotherms, X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and infrared dichroism to study Langmuir and Langmuir\xe2\x88\x92Blodgett films of 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaalkoxytriphenylenes which were selectively di- and trifunctionalized with CnH2n\xe2\x88\x92OH groups at the 2,3-, 2,6-, 3,6-, and 3,6,10-positions. The bulk phase behavior of these compounds was also established with use of polarizing microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. At the air\xe2\x88\x92water interface, the hydroxy groups make contact with the water, and the Langmuir film stability is strongly correlated with proximity of the hydroxy groups on the molecule. Mixtures of 2,3- and 3,6-isomers display a dramatic increase of the liquid\xe2\x88\x92crystalline mesophase temperature range compared to the pure compounds. The mixtures also have lower molecular areas at the air\xe2\x88\x92water interface and produce thin films with a complex superlattice structure of disk tilts, showing for the first time the ability of triphenylene isomer alloys to self-organize.

"Peroxynitrite can modify methionine by one- and two-electron oxidation pathways. Here, we have quantified the extent of one-electron oxidation of threonylmethionine (Thr-Met) by peroxynitrite using a characteristic reaction according to which Thr-Met sulfur radical cations decompose via fragmentation of the Thr side chain, yielding acetaldehyde. The efficiencies, facet,photo, for the formation of acetaldehyde from Thr-Met sulfur radical cations were obtained by means of one-electron photooxidation using triplet 4-carboxybenzophenone. Exact quantum yields for the formation of Thr-Met sulfur radical cations by triplet 4-carboxybenzophenone were obtained by laser flash photolysis and time-resolved UV spectroscopy. Acetaldehyde yields were measured for the reaction of peroxynitrite with Thr-Met, and division of these acetaldehyde yields by facet,photo yielded the extents to which peroxynitrite reacted with Thr-Met via the one-electron transfer pathway. There was little one-electron oxidation of Thr-Met by peroxynitrite at pH 7.4, i.e., 1.5%, 1.8%, and 5.3% based on the total chemical conversion of Thr-Met for Thr-Met concentrations of 1 \xc3\x97 10-3, 5 \xc3\x97 10-4, and 1.75 \xc3\x97 10-4 M, respectively. In all cases the major reaction product was the two-electron oxidation product threonylmethionine sulfoxide. However, at pH 6.0, one-electron oxidation of Thr-Met showed a significantly higher efficiency of 14% for [Thr-Met] = 1.75 \xc3\x97 10-4 M. Under all experimental conditions the extent of one-electron oxidation increased with decreasing peptide concentration in agreement with a recently established mechanism according to which the one-electron oxidation of Met by peroxynitrite requires a unimolecular transformation of peroxynitrous acid to an excited species which is the ultimate one-electron oxidant.

"The kinetics of oxyferryl (FeIVO) heme reduction in horse heart myoglobin (Mb) by a4LRuII (a = NH3; L = NH3, pyridine, isonicotinamide) bound at the surface His48 were investigated with pulse radiolysis. The observed first-order rate constants (kobs1) decreased with increasing pH and reduction potential for the a4LRu centers (E\xc2\xb0/RuIII/II = 77, 330, and 400 mV for L = NH3, Pyr, and Isn). Rate\xe2\x88\x92pD data obtained in D2O for the a5Ru derivative revealed the presence of an equilibrium isotope effect, and a pKa of 5.7 (6.2 in D2O) was obtained for the acid\xe2\x88\x92base group, which is assigned to the distal His64. A mechanism where protonation precedes ET provides a good fit of the kinetic data for the three a4LRu derivatives. Marcus theory analysis of the kET (0.74, 1.8, and 3.6 s-1 for L = Isn, Pyr, and NH3) extracted from the kobs1 values yielded a reorganization energy (\xce\xbb) of 1.8 for RuII \xe2\x86\x92 FeIVO ET in the a4LRu derivatives but a \xce\xbb of 2.1 eV for the a5Ru derivative. From the latter, it is concluded that ET is strongly gated in the a5Ru derivative, and this is assumed to be the major reason for the low reactivity of FeIVO in Mb at high \xe2\x88\x92\xce\x94G\xc2\xb0. "
"An in depth study of the capability of acylgermanes to function as acceptors in radical cyclizations is reported. Radicals add to acylgermanes, and rapid fragmentation of the resulting \xce\xb1-germylalkoxy radicals provides ketones and germyl radicals. The germyl radicals in turn propagate the chain by addition or abstraction, so the reaction occurs by a unimolecular chain transfer (UMCT) process. In contrast, acylsilanes also function as radical acceptors, but they do not participate in UMCT processes because a \xe2\x80\x9cradical-Brook\xe2\x80\x9d rearrangement intervenes. Cyclizations in 5-exo and 6-exo modes show good to excellent scope, and rate constants for cyclization can be varied over 2 orders of magnitude by changing the germanium substituents. Acyltriarylgermanes are among the best radical acceptors yet identified, and this quality makes them superior reagent equivalents of the carbonyl radical acceptor synthon. Parent cyclizations in the 4-exo and 7-exo modes fail. Attempted 3-exo cyclization results in a 1,2-acyl shift, which can be conducted alone or in tandem with a subsequent cyclization to the rearranged acylgermane. The results provide a foundation for future synthetic applications of radical cyclizations to acylgermanes. "
"Nanosecond length simulations applying the particle mesh Ewald method within AMBER 4.1 on canonical A-form and B-form geometries of d[CCAACGTTGG]2, r[CCAACGUUGG]2, and d[CCAACGTTGG]\xe2\x88\x92r[CCAACGUUGG] duplexes in aqueous solution are reported. DNA duplexes only adopt a stable B-DNA geometry, in contrast to RNA duplexes which adopt both a stable A-RNA and \xe2\x80\x9cB-RNA\xe2\x80\x9d geometry. The observation of a stable \xe2\x80\x9cB-RNA\xe2\x80\x9d structure is somewhat surprising and suggests significant kinetic barriers to structural conversion in RNA structures on a nanosecond time scale. The \xe2\x80\x9cB-RNA\xe2\x80\x9d can be converted to A-RNA by forcing a concerted flip in the sugar puckers from C2\xe2\x80\x98-endo to C3\xe2\x80\x98-endo. The A-RNA structure displays features similar to A-form crystal structures, specifically interstrand purine stacking at the central pyrimidine\xe2\x88\x92purine step is observed. When started in a canonical A-form geometry, DNA:RNA hybrid duplexes converge to a structure that is characteristic of experimental solution structures; specifically, a minor groove width intermediate between A-form and B-form geometries, the RNA strand in an A-form geometry, a mixture of C2\xe2\x80\x98-endo and C3\xe2\x80\x98-endo sugar puckers in the DNA strand, expected distribution of backbone angles and reasonable agreement with the helicoidal parameters are observed. In all of the simulations reported, A-form geometries appear to be less flexible than B-form geometries. There are also significant differences in the patterns of hydration and counterion association between A-form and B-form duplexes. In A-RNA, sodium counterions tend to associate into \xe2\x80\x9cpockets\xe2\x80\x9d in the major groove whereas these counterions tend to associate into the minor groove in B-form structures. "
"Low-temperature photolysis of \xce\xb1-HNIW (2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitrohexaazatetracyclo[5.5.05,9.03,11]dodecane) generated three 15NO2/15NO2 radical pairs that were studied by single-crystal electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at 80 K. In two of the pairs, A and B, the two NO2 molecules occupy solvent cavities that are related by unit translation along the a-axis of the \xce\xb1-HNIW unit cell (radical pair separations of 9.26 and 9.67 \xc3\x85). In the third pair, C, they occupy cavities related by translation along the b-axis (\xe2\x88\xbc13 \xc3\x85). Pair formation was highly specific since no pairs were trapped in cavities related by the b-glide (8.14 \xc3\x85). All three observed pairs survived annealing to 215 K, but from 220 to 294 K they decayed, one by one, without interconverting or separating to isolated radicals. Positive and negative exchange couplings as large as 0.004 cm-1 were estimated through approximate simulation of the position and intensity of transitions involving the nuclear states with hyperfine-induced So\xe2\x88\x92To mixing. Pairs B and C seem each to exist in two forms with a single NO2/NO2 structure but different values of J, due perhaps to different arrangement of nonbonded molecules between the radicals. Implications for the mechanism of solid-state HNIW decomposition and the limited mobility of small molecules in lightly damaged crystals are discussed. "
"Solvolysis of 9-(X-methyl)fluorene (1-X, X = I, Br, OBs) in 25 vol % acetonitrile in water gives the elimination product 9-methylidenefluorene and the substitution products 9-(hydroxymethyl)fluorene (1-OH) and 9-(acetamidomethyl)fluorene (1-NHCOMe). Kinetic studies of the corresponding ring-substituted compounds 2-X and 3-X show that the rate of elimination increases with increasing acidity of the substrate, Br\xc3\xb8nsted \xce\xb1 > 0. The small kinetic deuterium isotope effects measured for the elimination reactions of the brosylates 1-OBs and 3-OBs, kH/kD = 2.0 \xc2\xb1 0.1 and 2.8 \xc2\xb1 0.1, respectively, suggest significant amounts of E1 reaction. The bimolecular reactions of the brosylates with added bases may be of irreversible E1cB type in contrast to the reactions of the halides which exhibit E2 reaction with added bases as well as with solvent water.

"Agents have been designed and synthesized which target the dimerization interface of HIV-1 protease. These agents, which contain cross-linked peptides from the N- and C-termini of the protease, both inhibit HIV-1 protease activity and decrease the amount of protease dimer in solution as measured by size exclusion chromatography, protein crosslinking, and protease fluorescence studies. Additionally we have shown that active site-targeted agents inhibit HIV-1 protease activity but have little effect on protease dimerization. These data support the claim that inhibition with the crosslinked agents is based on a decrease in the amount of protease homodimer in solution which in turn is responsible for a decrease in the activity of the protease. "
"The dediazoniative arylation of various aromatic hydrocarbons (Ar\xe2\x80\x98H) with diazonium salts (ArN2+) in acetonitrile can be readily effected to biaryls (Ar-Ar\xe2\x80\x98) in high yields, simply by the addition of small (catalytic) amounts of sodium iodide. [In the absence of Ar\xe2\x80\x98H, the competitive iodination to ArI is nearly quantitative.] Iodide catalysis of biaryl formation is efficiently mediated by aryl radicals (Ar\xe2\x80\xa2) that participate in an efficient homolytic chain process in which ArN2+ acts as a 1-electron oxidant. The complex kinetics of such an electron-transfer chain or ETC process (Scheme 1) is quantitatively verified by computer simulation of the Ar\xe2\x80\x98H-dependent (a) competition between arylation vs iodination and (b) catalytic efficiency of iodide, using the GEAR algorithms. ETC catalysis also pertains to the alternative photochemical procedure for arylation (in the absence of iodide), in which the deliberate irradiation of the charge-transfer band of the precursor complex [ArN2+, Ar\xe2\x80\x98H] initiates the same homolytic chain arylation. The latter underscores the mechanistic generality of the ETC formulation for various types of catalytic dediazoniations of aromatic diazonium salts. "
"The synthesis of (1\xe2\x86\x926), (1\xe2\x86\x924), and (1\xe2\x86\x921) linked aza-C-disaccharides, a novel class of glycomimetic compounds, is described. The polyhydroxylated piperidine ring was synthesized using vinyl bromide 11 as a common intermediate which was synthesized de novo from bromobenzene utilizing the microbial oxidation metabolite bromodiol 10. A Suzuki coupling of 11 with an alkylboron reagent derived from olefinated carbohydrate precursors via hydroboration was used to form the C-glycosidic bond. Ozonolysis and selective reduction of the resultant carbonyl functions served to produce the azasugar ring. Fully deprotected aza-C-disaccharides were obtained upon acidic deprotection. Biological screening of the title compounds against several common glycosidase enzymes as well as in vitro anti-HIV assays are reported. "
"The hydration of polar natural and synthetic lipids yields a variety of lipid phases including various inverted cubic phases and the inverted hexagonal (HII) phase. The HII phase can be considered as aqueous columns encased with a monolayer of lipids and arranged in a hexagonal pattern. The polar head groups are well-ordered at the water interface, whereas the lipid tails are disordered to fill the volume between the tubes of water. A particularly interesting characteristic of the HII phase is the large temperature effect on the basis vector length d of the hexagonal lattice. Previous studies indicate that polymerization of the lipid region of the HII phase might reduce the sensitivity of the basis vector to temperature. A phosphoethanolamine (PE) was designed and synthesized with dienoyl groups in each lipid tail in an attempt to cross-link the lipids around and along the water core of the HII phase. The synthesis of the the PE was accomplished by acylation of 3-(4-methoxybenzyl)-sn-glycerol with 2,4,13-(E,E,Z)-docosatrienoic acid, followed by deprotection, then phosphorylation with dichloro-[[N-[(2,2,2-trichloroethoxy)carbonyl]-2-amino]ethyl]phosphinic acid to give the Troc-PE, which was converted to the PE with activated zinc and acetic acid. The hydrated PE (1/1 weight lipid/water) formed the HII phase over an extended temperature range. Polymerization to high conversion was accomplished at 60 \xc2\xb0C with the aid of redox initiators. Polymerization was followed in-situ using X-ray diffraction over a period of 48 h. The scattering, which weakened over the course of the reaction, remained consistent with a hexagonal phase. Temperature cycling of the polymerized HII phase showed an unaltered pattern on decreasing temperature while maintaining the same lattice parameter, unlike that of the unpolymerized phase where the value increased with decreasing temperature. Thus it is possible to fix the dimensions of the HII phase by cross-linking polymerization of appropriately designed reactive lipids. "
"A new methodology for solution-phase chemical library synthesis and purification is described. This approach applies fundamental properties of complementary molecular reactivity and recognition (CMR/R) as the basis for a general purification strategy. Specifically, parallel solution-phase reactions are purified by resins containing molecular recognition or molecular reactivity functionalities complementary to those of solution-phase reactants, reagents, and byproducts. When used in sequential or simultaneous combinations, various CMR/R resins remove excess reactants, reagents, and byproducts from solution-phase reaction products, which are isolated in purified form by filtration. Where reactions involve the need to remove byproducts or reagents that do not inherently contain sequestrable functionality, sequestration can be effected by the design and use of tagged reactants or reagents containing artificially-imparted molecular recognition functionality. An extension of this methodology utilizes CMR/R resins as the \xe2\x80\x9cquench phase\xe2\x80\x9d instead of a liquid-phase workup commonly used in other library purification strategies. Hence, the essential features of complementary molecular reactivity or molecular recognition required for reaction workup are expressed on resins. The CMR/R library purification strategy is general and highly amenable to automation. Examples are illustrated with amine acylations, the Moffatt oxidation, and the reaction of organometallics with carbonyl compounds. "
"The preparation of polystyrene\xe2\x88\x92divinylbenzene-supported derivatives of tris(2-aminoethyl)amine and methyl isocyanate are described. These polymeric reagents are used to quench excess reactants and remove known impurities from the crude reaction products obtained from the solution-phase, parallel syntheses of ureas, thioureas, sulfonamides, amides, and pyrazoles. In conjunction with the use of other polymeric reactants during the course of a reaction, the addition of polymer-supported quench reagent(s) at the conclusion of the reaction allows isolation of the desired product by a single filtration and evaporation of solvent. The mechanical simplicity and efficiency of this methodology make possible the rapid, parallel purification of crude reaction products obtained via solution-phase syntheses, regardless of whether the intended product is a single compound or a mixture of compounds, and hence offers an attractive alternative to solid-phase organic synthesis in the practice of combinatorial chemistry. "
"Ab initio and density functional theoretical investigations into the nature of the reaction of acetylene with noncluster organocuprate reagents, MeCu, Me2Cu-, and lithium organocuprate cluster reagents, Me2CuLi, Me2CuLi\xc2\xb7LiCl, and (Me2CuLi)2 were carried out, and the function of the mixed metal cluster was probed. Intermediates transition structures (TSs) as well as the structures on the intrinsic reaction coordinate in the C\xe2\x88\x92C bond forming stage of the reaction of lithium cuprate clusters have been calculated with the ab initio method (MP2) and density functional method (B3LYP) using all-electron basis sets for copper. The addition reaction of the simple organocopper reagent, MeCu, can be viewed as a simple four-centered addition reaction consisting of nucleophilic addition of an anionic methyl group, while the addition of the cuprate reagent, Me2Cu-, involves transfer of negative charge to the acetylene via the copper atom. In the cluster reaction of Me2CuLi\xc2\xb7LiCl, the lithium atom in the cluster stabilizes the developing negative charge on the acetylene moiety and assists the electron flow from the copper atom. Reductive elimination of the transient Cu(III) species initially gives a 1-propenyllithium-like structure intermediate (nonstationary point), which then undergoes intramolecular transmetalation to give the final product, 1-propenylcopper. Essentially the same mechanism operates also with Me2CuLi and (Me2CuLi)2, indicating that the Li\xe2\x88\x92Me\xe2\x88\x92Cu\xe2\x88\x92Me moiety incorporated in the mixed organocuprate cluster is essential for the reaction. Experiments showed that the strong solvation of the lithium atom with a crown ether, which sequesters the lithium cation from the cluster, strongly decelerates the carbocupration reaction. Thus, theory and experiments revealed the cooperative function of lithium and copper atoms in the cuprate reactions. "
"The reaction pathway of transfer of a methyl group of a cuprate cluster (Me2CuLi)2 to acrolein (conjugate addition of the methyl group) has been studied with the hybrid density functional B3LYP method. All intermediates and transition structures (TSs) on the potential surface of the reaction as well as the structures on the intrinsic reaction coordinate near the C\xe2\x88\x92C bond forming stage of the reaction have been determined. In addition to two previously proposed species, a lithium/carbonyl coordination complex (CPli) and a copper/olefin complex retaining a closed cuprate structure (CPcl), a new copper/olefin complex with an open cuprate structure (CPop) was characterized and proven to be an intermediate directly leading to the conjugate addition product (PD) via a TS of C\xe2\x88\x92C bond formation (TS). The overall pathway of the reaction can be viewed, in one way, as C\xe2\x88\x92C bond formation via reductive elimination of a Cu(III) species and, in another, as a 1,4-addition of MeLi assisted by copper. The present studies revealed that the large cluster framework of (Me2CuLi)2 allows intricate cooperation of two lithium atoms and a copper atom. A small cluster such as Me2CuLi cannot achieve such cooperative action of different metal atoms as smoothly as larger clusters such as (Me2CuLi)2 and Me2CuLi\xc2\xb7LiCl. Mechanistic relationships between conjugate addition, carbocupration, and alkylation reactions of cuprate are discussed. A close similarity has been found between the conjugate addition and the carbocupration of acetylene for the cooperative action of metal and the involvement of a Cu(III) species. "
"A nickel-catalyzed method for cyclizations of electron-deficient alkenes with tethered unsaturation in the presence of organozincs was developed. Considerable flexibility in the structure of each reactive component was observed. Enones, alkylidene malonates, unsaturated \xce\xb2-ketoesters, and nitroalkenes participated as the electron-deficient alkene; alkynes, enones, 1,3-dienes, and aldehydes participated as the tethered unsaturation; and a variety of sp2 and sp3-hybridized organozincs, including those that possess \xce\xb2-hydrogens, participated as the nucleophilic component. Substrate structure, organozinc structure, and ligand structure all played a significant role in determining product selectivities. Of particular synthetic significance was the opportunity to prepare either E or Z tri- or tetrasubstituted alkenes from a common alkyne. A discussion of probable mechanisms is provided. "
"We demonstrate the first application of L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to the electronic characterization of biological photolysis products. The experimental L-edge XAS spectra of deoxymyoglobin (deoxy Mb), oxymyoglobin (MbO2), carbonmonoxymyoglobin (MbCO), and the low-temperature photoproducts (Mb*CO and Mb*O2) are presented and compared to simulated spectra using a ligand field multiplet calculation. This analysis indicates that MbCO and MbO2 are both low spin and does not support some previous studies which suggest that MbO2 has an intermediate spin. Both photoproducts, Mb*CO and Mb*O2, are different from deoxy Mb in the FeII electronic structure. In addition, different low-temperature photolysis intermediates are suggested for MbCO and MbO2. The L-edge XAS spectra for FeIII in aquometmyoglobin (met Mb) and azidomet myoglobin (MbN3) provide a comparison of the ferrous versus ferric myoglobin species. Finally, the special advantages of using soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy for understanding the electronic transitions coupled to photolysis-induced structural changes are discussed. "
"Complex formation between pyrazine derivatives and dimeric self-assembly of \xce\xb1\xce\xb1\xce\xb1\xce\xb1-isomer of meso-tetrakis(2-carboxy-4-nonylphenyl)porphyrin Zn complex (1\xc2\xb7Zn) was investigated. Thermal atropisomerization of 1\xc2\xb7Zn in a nonpolar solvent such as toluene gives the \xce\xb1\xce\xb1\xce\xb1\xce\xb1-atropisomer exclusively. Vapor pressure osmometry for the resultant \xce\xb1\xce\xb1\xce\xb1\xce\xb1-atropisomer solubilized in CHCl3 shows molecular weight of 2650 \xc2\xb1 200, indicating formation of dimeric self-assembly of 1\xc2\xb7Zn. 1H NMR and UV/vis titration experiments for this dimeric assembly with pyrazine derivatives show highly specific 1:2 complex formation of pyrazine and 1\xc2\xb7Zn. The equilibrium constants for 1\xc2\xb7Zn dimer/pyrazine complex formation are estimated to be over 107 M-1. The most characteristic feature of the present ternary system, (1\xc2\xb7Zn)2\xc2\xb7pyrazine, is that the pyrazine derivative, having a large side moiety such as benzoyl group, can coordinate two zinc atoms inside the dimer cavity by sticking the side moiety out of a window formed between hydrogen-bond pillars of the complex.

"The synthesis and iron(III) coordination properties of three tripodal ligands (L1, L2, and L3) possessing hydroxamate coordination cavities are examined by various methods (ESMS, UV\xe2\x88\x92vis, CD). The ligands rely on a trisamine as anchor, which is extended by an alternating sequence of variable spacers and hydroxamates as ion binding groups. This modular strategy of design is adopted for the compounds\' preparation and enables modifications of each structural element independently. The coordination properties of these iron binding molecules and particularly the presence of allosteric effects are examined by classical spectrophotometric titrations in combination with electrospray mass spectrometric measurements (ESMS). A good match between these two methods is observed, as both indicate the formation of three species in thermodynamic equilibrium:\xe2\x80\x89 mononuclear, binuclear, and trinuclear ferric complexes. The respective stability constants are determined at p[H] = 6.5 \xc2\xb1 0.1 in methanol, and the corresponding distribution curves clearly illustrate the variations from ligand to ligand. These findings demonstrate that subtle structural changes have a pronounced effect on these compounds\' coordination properties. Moreover, among the binders studied representatives of opposite cooperative behavior is identified. The observed dependence of the ligands\' coordination properties on their structural features are rationalized. "
"The catalytic activity of the zwitterionic complex [(sulphos)Rh(cod)] for the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions of benzo[b]thiophene (BT) has been studied in either methanol or liquid-biphase systems comprising MeOH or MeOH\xe2\x88\x92H2O as the polar phase and n-heptane as the organic phase [sulphos = -O3S(C6H4)CH2C(CH2PPh2)3]. The catalyst activity is independent of the phase variation. Under neutral conditions, the slow but selective hydrogenation of BT to 2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]thiophene is observed. Conversely, in the presence of NaOH or other strong bases, the fast and selective hydrogenolysis of BT to 2-ethylthiophenol sodium salt occurs. In a typical liquid-biphase hydrogenolysis reaction [35 mg (0.035 mmol) of catalyst, 470 mg (3.5 mmol) of BT, 180 mg (4.5 mmol) of NaOH, 5 mL of MeOH, 5 mL of H2O, 10 mL of n-heptane, 30 bar of H2, 160 \xc2\xb0C], all the substrate is practically consumed in ca. 5 h to give the 2-ethylthiophenolate product. The strong base plays a dual role in the hydrogenolysis reaction:\xe2\x80\x89 it promotes the formation of the Rh\xe2\x88\x92H species (which is necessary for the C\xe2\x88\x92S insertion step) by heterolytic splitting of H2 and accelerates the conversion of BT by aiding the reductive elimination of the hydrogenolysis product. The effect of the H2 pressure and of the substrate, catalyst, and base concentrations on the conversion rate of BT has been studied under liquid-biphase conditions. High-pressure NMR experiments in sapphire tubes have provided mechanistic information on the catalysis cycle for the hydrogenolysis of BT in MeOH. Under catalytic conditions, the phosphorus-containing rhodium compounds (visible on the NMR time scale) are the trihydride [(sulphos)RhH3]- and the dihydride 2-ethylthiophenolate complex [(sulphos)Rh(H)2(o-S(C6H4)C2H5)]-. Consistent with previous studies, the reductive elimination of the thiol from the metal center is suggested to be the rate-determining step of the hydrogenolysis reaction of BT catalyzed by the 16e- fragment [(sulphos)RhH]-.

"The synthesis, structural characterization, and electrochemical properties of N3S2-ligated metal complexes of the ligand 4,10-dithia-1,7,13-triazabicyclo[11.3.3]nonadecane are described. Complexes of NiII, CoII, and RhIII have been characterized by X-ray crystallography as six-coordinate complexes of the pentadentate ligand with Cl- anions occupying the position trans to the secondary amine donor. In addition, the chelation of the N3S2 donor ligand to the reactor-produced radionuclide 105Rh was shown to give a single product in high yield (>98% at pH 5). The ligand is prepared by the template reaction of (N,N\xe2\x80\x98-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)-1,5-diazacyclooctane)nickel(II), Ni-1, with bis(2-chloroethyl)amine, yielding (S,S\xe2\x80\x98-(3-aza-1,5-pentanediyl)-N,N\xe2\x80\x98-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)-1,5-diazacyclooctane-N,N\xe2\x80\x98,N\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98,S,S\xe2\x80\x98)nickel(II) chloride, [Ni(amine)Cl]Cl. Removal of nickel from [Ni(amine)Cl]Cl and subsequent reaction of the ligand with CoCl2 or RhCl3\xc2\xb7xH2O afforded (S,S\xe2\x80\x98-(3-aza-1,5-pentanediyl)-N,N\xe2\x80\x98-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)-1,5-diazacyclooctane-N,N\xe2\x80\x98,N\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98,S,S\xe2\x80\x98)cobalt(II) chloride, [Co(amine)Cl]Cl, C14H29N3S2CoCl2\xc2\xb71.75MeOH, and (S,S\xe2\x80\x98-(3-aza-1,5-pentanediyl)-N,N\xe2\x80\x98-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)-1,5-diazacyclooctane-N,N\xe2\x80\x98,N\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98,S,S\xe2\x80\x98)rhodium(III) chloride, [Rh(amine)Cl]Cl2, C14H29N3S2RhCl3, respectively. The blue complex [Ni(amine)Cl]Cl, C14H29N3S2NiCl2\xc2\xb7MeOH, contains nickel in an octahedral environment of N3S2Cl donors and crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c with a = 13.278(3) \xc3\x85, b = 11.976(4) \xc3\x85, c = 12.928(4) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 102.17(2)\xc2\xb0, and Z = 4. The complex [Co(amine)Cl]Cl is fuchsia and crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n with a = 10.321(2) \xc3\x85, b = 7.892(1) \xc3\x85, c = 27.684(3) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 96.91(1)\xc2\xb0, and Z = 4. Yellow crystals of [Rh(amine)Cl]Cl2, C14H29N3S2RhCl3, were determined to be in the monoclinic space group C1c1 with a = 9.655(2) \xc3\x85, b = 16.805(4) \xc3\x85, c = 11.756(3) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 96.29(2)\xc2\xb0, and Z = 4.

"The tetrapeptides APGD and APGN are known by NMR analysis to adopt reverse turn conformations to a significant degree in aqueous solution. We have carried out a 7.7 ns molecular dynamics simulation of Ace-APGD-NHMe in explicit water, and have analyzed the energetics of snapshots from this simulation in terms of a molecular mechanics energy function, estimates of solvation free energy based on numerical solutions of the Poisson\xe2\x88\x92Boltzmann equation (in which the solvent is treated as a high-dielectric continuum), and an estimate of chain entropy effects derived from a systematic search procedure. In the unconstrained trajectory, 17 transitions occur between turn and extended conformers, suggesting that the free energy profile is nearly flat and that the simulation is moderately-well-equilibrated with respect to this transition; the turn population found is within the experimental range. The potential of mean force, constructed as the sum of solute force-field energies, continuum solvation, and hard-sphere chain entropy, agrees with that computed directly from the simulation to within 2 kcal/mol across the entire range of configurations sampled. The study has been extended to the tetrapeptide APGN by repeating the energetic analysis with an Asn side chain replacing the Asp in the APGD snapshots. A comparison of energetics with Asp and Asn side chains shows a complex interplay among vacuum electrostatic terms, dielectric screening terms, and solvation free energy terms such that the net effect of side chain substitution on turn formation is very small. Prospects for application of this sort of analysis to other peptide and protein conformational problems are discussed. "
"Nine disilenes have been studied by solid-state NMR spectroscopy, under static or slow magic-angle spinning conditions, to determine the 29Si chemical shift tensors. All of the compounds show strong deshielding along one axis and correspondingly large spreads of the tensor components, \xce\x94\xce\xb4 (=\xce\xb411 \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xb433). MO calculations on model disilenes indicate that the deshielding results from a paramagnetic contribution along the in-plane axis perpendicular to the Si\xe2\x88\x92Si vector. lmplications of the NMR data and the theoretical camputations for SiSi bonding are discussed.

"The examination of shortened, simplified, and extended analogs of duocarmycin SA is described and constitutes a detailed study of the role of linked DNA binding subunit. In addition to enhancing the DNA binding affinity and selectivity through minor groove noncovalent contacts, the studies in conjunction with those of the accompanying article illustrate that an extended rigid N2 amide substituent is required for catalysis of the DNA alkylation reaction. This activation for DNA alkylation is independent of pH, and we propose it results from a binding-induced conformational change in the agents which increases their inherent reactivity. The ground state destabilization of the substrate results from a twist in the linking amide that disrupts the vinylogous amide stabilization of the alkylation subunit and activates the agent for nucleophilic addition. This leads to preferential activation of the agents for DNA alkylation within the narrower, deeper AT-rich minor groove sites where the inherent twist in the linking amide and helical rise of the bound conformation is greatest. Thus, shape-selective recognition (preferential AT-rich noncovalent binding) and shape-dependent catalysis (induced twist in linking N2 amide) combine to restrict SN2 alkylation to accessible adenine N3 nucleophilic sites within the preferred binding sites. Additional ramifications of this DNA binding-induced conformational change on the reversibility of the DNA alkylation reaction are discussed. The results of the study illustrate the importance of the C5\xe2\x80\x98 methoxy group and the C6 methyl ester of duocarmycin SA, and a previously unrecognized role for these substituents is proposed. "
"The synthesis and examination of two unique classes of duocarmycin SA analogs are described which we refer to as reversed and sandwiched analogs. Their examination established both the origin of the DNA alkylation selectivity and that both enantiomers of this class of natural products are subject to the same polynucleotide recognition features. The most beautiful demonstration of this is the complete switch in the enantiomeric alkylation selectivity of the reversed analogs which is only consistent with the noncovalent binding model and incompatible with alkylation site models of the origin of the DNA alkylation selectivity. In addition, dramatic alterations in the rates of DNA alkylation were observed among the agents and correlate with the presence or absence of an extended, rigid N2 amide substituent. This has led to the proposal of a previously unrecognized source of catalysis for the DNA alkylation reaction which was introduced in the preceding paper of this issue (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 4977\xe2\x88\x924986). "
"The equilibrium ratios for the zwitterionic and neutral forms of the nicotinic and isonicotinic acids (3- and 4-COOH pyridines) have been determined by spectrophotometry in mixtures of water with methanol, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane. The zwitterionic form of the solute is the prevalent structure in mixtures with at least 60% water. In pure organic solvents, the neutral form was found in almost 100%. Ab initio calculations at the MP2/6-311++G**//MP2/6-31G* level predict that the zwitterion is higher in free energy by 33\xe2\x88\x9235 kcal/mol than the neutral tautomer at T = 298 K and p = 1 atm in the gas phase. In contrast, relative solvation free energies, as calculated by the free energy perturbation method in Monte Carlo simulations, are \xe2\x88\x9236, \xe2\x88\x9227, and \xe2\x88\x9215 kcal/mol in water, methanol, and tetrahydrofuran, respectively. The solvent effects for overbalancing the relative internal free energy of the zwitterion and stabilizing this tautomer are large enough only in water and in aqueous solution with water fraction above 60%. Predominance of the neutral form in pure organic solvents is due to considerably lower internal energy of this structure as compared to that of the zwitterion. "
"An analysis of variational transition state theory rate constants, for the association reactions Cl- + CH3Cl, Cl- + CH3Br, H + CH3, H + diamond{111}, CH3 + CH3, and Al + Al2 shows that the free energy of activation \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 varies nearly linearly with temperature, over a broad temperature range, for each reaction. This suggests that association rate constants can be parametrized by the free energy of activation at 300 K, \xce\x94 , and the change in \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 with temperature, \xce\x94\xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7/\xce\x94T. The near linear dependence of \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 with temperature is supported by a semiempirical model for association kinetics. The rate constants for Cl- + CH3Cl, Cl- + CH3Br, and CH3 + CH3 decrease with increase in temperature, while those for H + CH3, H + diamond{111}, and Al + Al2 slightly increase. For the six association reactions considered here, the linear free energy relationship gives semiquantitative rate constants over a rather broad temperature range of 200\xe2\x88\x922000 K. To calculate accurate rate constants over a broader temperature range, particularly at low temperatures, nonlinear terms must be included in the free energy expansion. "
"Identity SN2 reactions of methyl fluoride and chloride with fluoride and chloride ions are compared computationally with the ion pair displacement reactions of lithium fluoride and chloride and of sodium fluoride. The results with the RHF MP2 and B3LYP methods and the 6-31+G* basis set essentially confirm some previous results obtained by RHF and MPn methods. The ion pair reactions proceed via an initial dipole\xe2\x88\x92dipole complex and a cyclic transition structure with highly bent X\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92X bonds that resemble a collection of two cations and two anions. Extension of the calculations to the corresponding ethyl systems gives lower ion pair barriers than methyl, completely different from the corresponding ionic barriers. The bending away of the halogens in the ion pair transition structures reduces steric effects. Analysis of charge distributions shows that in the ionic transition structures the nearby halogens electrostatically inhibit polarization and delocalization of charge. The nonlinear X\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92X bond angle in the ion pair transition structures coupled with the electrostatic influence of the cation permits greater charge polarization and delocalization within the organic moiety and allows the greater stability of ethyl cation compared to methyl to manifest itself. n-Propyl, isopropyl, and neopentyl chlorides have lower barriers than ethyl in reaction with lithium chloride but isopropyl and neopentyl chlorides have higher barriers than ethyl toward chloride ion.

"Density functional theory is used to study one of the most successful routes to the production of synthetic fuels, the conversion of methanol to gasoline (MTG process) with an acidic zeolite. With our calculations we have determined transition states and adsorption complexes of reactants, intermediates, and products as well as the corresponding activation barriers and adsorption energies of the numerous reactions involved in such a process. Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid catalyzed methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether is the first step of the MTG process. Two different mechanisms are possible. One proceeds via an associative interaction between two methanol molecules, generating directly dimethyl ether, while the other proceeds via a methoxy surface species intermediate. The presence of water lowers the activation barrier of the last mechanism by more than 50 kJ/mol. Our calculations suggest that ethanol and ethyl methyl ether are the first formed species with a C\xe2\x88\x92C bond. Several different mechanisms for those reactions have been studied. The activation barriers involved in such reactions are of the order of 300 kJ/mol for both ethanol and ethyl methyl ether. Without coadsorbed water, the activation barriers are 60 kJ/mol higher. In a following step ethylene is formed from alcohol or ether. Those reactions are very fast due to a very low activation barrier. Trimethyloxonium, proposed to be an intermediate in the formation of ethyl methyl ether, can be excluded as an intermediate for the C\xe2\x88\x92C bond formation. Although it can be formed, its further reaction to ethanol or ethyl methyl ether involves activation barriers that are over 80\xe2\x88\x92150 kJ/mol higher than their formation directly from dimethyl ether and methanol. Reaction paths for the formation of methane and formaldehyde, which are observed in reactions for very low methanol coverages, have also been studied. "
"We have determined the experimental charge density of the title compound, a large pendant arm macrocyclic complex, by fitting a multipole model to high-resolution X-ray diffraction data. We find redistribution of the charge density from the ligating nitrogen and oxygen atoms to the central nickel ion which considerably reduces the charge on the metal. While the d-orbital populations are in agreement with ligand-field theory, the charge density of the metal shows diffuse features which are ascribed to metal 4s and 4p participation in the metal\xe2\x88\x92ligand bonding. Additionally, the trigonal-planar arrangement of critical points in \xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x872\xcf\x81(r) within the valence shell charge concentration (VSCC) of the ligating oxygen atom provides evidence for metal\xe2\x88\x92oxygen \xcf\x80-bonding.

"New methods based on photolithography and surface fluorescence were used to determine photodeprotection rates and stepwise yields for light-directed oligonucleotide synthesis using photolabile 5\xe2\x80\x98-(((\xce\xb1-methyl-2-nitropiperonyl)oxy)carbonyl)(MeNPOC)-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxynucleoside phosphoramidites on planar glass substrates. Under near-UV illumination (primarily 365 nm) from a mercury light source, the rate of photoremoval of the MeNPOC protecting group was found to be independent of both the nucleotide and length of the growing oligomer (t1/2 = 12 s at 27.5 mW/cm2). A moderate dependence on solvent polarity was observed, with photolysis proceeding most rapidly in the presence of nonpolar solvents or in the absence of solvent (e.g., t1/2 = 10\xe2\x88\x9213 s at 27.5 mW/cm2). In solution, the photolysis rate was linearly dependent on light intensity over the range 5\xe2\x88\x9250 mW/cm2. Average stepwise yields for the synthesis of dodecamer oligonucleotides were in the range of 92\xe2\x88\x9294%, using monomers based on N6-(phenoxyacetyl)-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyadenosine, N2-isobutyryl-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine, N4-isobutyryl-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxycytidine, and thymidine. By comparison, an efficiency of 98%/step was obtained using a conventional 5\xe2\x80\x98-dimethoxytrityl monomer with acid deprotection on the same support. The lower yields associated with the photochemical process appears to be due to incomplete recovery of free 5\xe2\x80\x98-hydroxyl groups after photolysis on the support, although high yields of 5\xe2\x80\x98-OH nucleosides (\xe2\x89\xa596%) are consistently observed when 5\xe2\x80\x98-MeNPOC monomers are photolyzed in solution.

"The reaction of atomic carbon with N-methylpyrrole, 5b, at 77 K generates the N-methyl-3-dehydropyridinium ylid, 6b, which can be trapped with added hydrogen halides or CO2. The addition of CO2 is strong evidence for the ylid 6b rather than cumulene 7. Deuterium and 13C labeling studies demonstrate that 6b rapidly rearranges to the N-methyl-2-dehydropyridinium ylid, 13, by an intermolecular mechanism. Ylid 13 can be trapped with added acids or with O2 to form 1-methyl-2-pyridone. "
"Single-crystal X-ray analysis of 1-(2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl)-3-methylphosphole, synthesized to test the effect of the strongly sterically demanding P-substituent on the geometry of the molecule, revealed that the phosphorus pyramid was drastically flattened; the normal out of plane angle of 65\xc2\xb0 (formed between the P-substituent and the ring C2\xe2\x88\x92P\xe2\x88\x92C5 plane) was reduced to 45.9\xc2\xb0. Consistent with strong electron delocalization, the C3\xe2\x88\x92C4 bond length was dramatically shortened relative to that for other phospholes, and the Bird index of aromaticity was 56.5, almost the equivalent of that in pyrrole (59). The phosphole ring, normally resisitant to electrophilic substitutions, underwent reaction with acetyl chloride\xe2\x88\x92aluminum chloride, consistent with considerable cyclic electron delocalization.

"Kinetic and regioselectivity data are reported for the Gattermann\xe2\x88\x92Koch formylation of m-xylene, 1-methylnaphthalene, and toluene in HF\xe2\x88\x92SbF5 and CF3SO3H\xe2\x88\x92SbF5 as a function of SbF5/substrate molar ratio. The kinetic study for m-xylene formylation in HF\xe2\x88\x92SbF5 provided crucial evidence in favor of intracomplex reaction via a third-order rate equation, [ArH][ArH2+SbF6-][CO], where the formylation electrophile HCO+ is generated by CO protonation by the arenium ion. Dependence of regioselectivity on substrate, superacid, and SbF5/substrate molar ratio showed that high para regioselectivity stems from intracomplex reaction and the observed regioselectivity reflects the ratio between the intracomplex and the conventional reactions. Comparison in regioselectivity between Gattermann\xe2\x88\x92Koch formylation and Friedel\xe2\x88\x92Crafts formylation with use of HCOF suggested that regioselectivity trends do not reflect the nature of the electrophile but the reaction pathway; the Friedel\xe2\x88\x92Crafts formylation also appears to have intracomplex reaction character.

The one-step \xe2\x80\x9cdimerization\xe2\x80\x9d (with loss of ethylene) of the immunosuppressant FK506 by olefin metathesis has been used to create new chemical inducers of dimerization (CIDs). These small-molecule protein dimerizers are shown to activate signal transduction pathways and gene transcription at low concentrations in mammalian cells. Their ease of synthesis provides ready access to reagents of widespread utility in studies of the cellular functions of proteins. 
"Transient resonance Raman spectroscopy has been used to probe the vibrational dynamics of the heme active site of deoxyhemoglobin during photoexcitation. Near UV pulses of approximately 35 ps in duration were used to both excite the sample and generate resonance Raman spectra of the heme during its rapid electronic and vibrational relaxation. The behavior of the Stokes and anti-Stokes transitions as a function of incident laser flux directly reflects net heme vibrational populations and permits the isolation and characterization of ground and excited electronic state phenomena. Scattering from excited electronic states significantly influences the spectra only at the highest excitation fluxes used in this study. A simple model that accounts for the flux-dependent manifestations of the electronic and vibrational contributions to the heme transient resonance Raman spectra is discussed. In addition, the data presented here clearly show mode selectivity in the vibrational energy distribution associated with the ground electronic state. Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering from the prominent \xce\xbd4 and \xce\xbd7 modes reflect a heme with a non-Boltzmann vibrational population distribution, even at relatively modest excitation intensities. The \xce\xbd4 mode appears to act as a \xe2\x80\x9cbottleneck\xe2\x80\x9d vibrational state, while the \xce\xbd7 mode couples quite effectively to the bath degrees of freedom. The potential origins and ramifications of the creation and maintenance of such relatively long-lived, nonstatistical vibrational population distributions in the heme also are addressed. "
"We have successfully substituted 240Pu3+ for Ca2+ in the calcium-binding protein calmodulin and used neutron resonance scattering from the bound 240Pu to demonstrate that the Pu binds specifically to the Ca2+ sites and also to measure the distance between the ion binding sites within individual domains of the protein. 240Pu has a strong nuclear resonance at 0.278 \xc3\x85, and at this wavelength the coherent scattering from 240Pu is >1000 times that of any other nucleus present in a protein. The ionic radius of Pu3+ is very similar to that of Ca2+, and hence we chose this species to substitute for Ca2+ in the protein. We identified solution conditions that stablize Pu3+ in solution at near neutral pH for 6\xe2\x88\x927 h in order to form the Pu/calmodulin complex under conditions favorable for both complex formation and maintaining the structural integrity of the protein. We collected small-angle neutron scattering data from solutions of 4(240Pu3+)\xc2\xb7calmodulin, which contain periodic terms that are directly related to the distances between the Ca2+-binding sites. The shorter Pu\xe2\x88\x92Pu distance, i.e., the average distance between the two sites within each globular domain of calmodulin, is found to be 11.8 \xc2\xb1 0.4 \xc3\x85, in excellent agreement with the value of 11.7 \xc3\x85 from crystallographic determinations. This is the first use of neutron resonance scattering as a structural probe in a protein. "
"The molecular mechanism of carbofuran metabolism was investigated by molecular modeling using the energy-minimized active site of cytochrome P-450cam. A feasible binding conformation of carbofuran was subjected to Monte Carlo (MC) conformational search and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in the active site to obtain the global minimum of the enzyme\xe2\x88\x92substrate complex. For exploring its conformational space, MC was found to be more effective than simple MD. Enzyme\xe2\x88\x92substrate interactions were examined in detail in all low-energy states. Distances between the active ferryl oxygen of the central heme unit and the reactive centers of carbofuran involved in oxidative metabolism were monitored. H-bonding interaction between the carbamate group of carbofuran and the Tyr96-OH group, as well as the steric effects of Val247 and Val295, were found to be crucial for the orientation of carbofuran. The preferred formation of 3-hydroxycarbofuran, the major primer metabolite, could be rationalized by the model. The configuration at the C3 atom was predicted to be S in accordance with the stereospecificity reported for the natural substrate. "

The products are zwitterionic olefin polymerization catalysts. Reactions with 1a and 1b yielded single products cleanly, but reactions with tuck-in methyl starting material 1c gave mixtures. Spectroscopic and structural studies showed that the electrophilic zirconium center in the product zwitterions was stabilized by a variety of mechanisms. In the products of reaction between 1a and 1b with HB(C6F5)2, Cp*[\xce\xb75,\xce\xb71-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)2(\xce\xbc-H)]ZrX (X = Cl (2a), 74%), C6H5 (2b, 62%)), the metal is chelated by a pendant hydridoborate moiety. Chloride product 2a was characterized crystallographically. In the reaction of B(C6F5)3 with 1a, the fluxional zwitterionic product Cp*[\xce\xb75-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)3]ZrCl (3a, 84%) is stabilized by a weak donor interaction between one of the ortho fluorine atoms of the \xe2\x88\x92CH2B-(C6F5)3 counterion and the zirconium center (Zr\xe2\x88\x92F = 2.267(5) \xc3\x85). In the product of the reaction between 1b and B(C6F5)3, Cp*[\xce\xb75-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)3]ZrC6H5 (3b, 82%), a similar ortho-fluorine interaction was found in a yellow kinetic product (y-3b), which converted upon heating gently to a thermodynamic orange polymorph (o-3b) in which the zirconium center is compensated via an agostic interaction from an ortho C\xe2\x88\x92H bond of the phenyl group and an interaction between the methylene group of the \xe2\x88\x92CH2B-(C6F5)3 counteranion. These compounds were both characterized by X-ray crystallography. Zwitterion o-3b reacts with H2 to form the zwitterionic hydride Cp*[\xce\xb75-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)3]ZrH (4, 77%), characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography to reveal a return to the ortho-fluorine mode of stabilization. Compounds 2a, 3a, o-3b, and 4 were all found to be active ethlyene polymerization catalysts; the chloride derivatives required minimal amounts of methylaluminoxane (MAO) to alkylate the zirconium center. Polymerization data are discussed in light of the structural findings for the catalysts employed. "
"The reduction of [Mn(II)-salophen] derivatives [salophen = N,N\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x98-ethylenebis(salicylideneaminato) dianion] led to the formation of C\xe2\x88\x92C bridged dimers. Such C\xe2\x88\x92C bonds function as two electron shuttles in electron-transfer reactions. The reduction of [Mn(salophen)(THF)]2 (1) and [Mn(3,5-But4salophen)(THF)]2 (3) with 2 equiv of sodium metal led to the corresponding single C\xe2\x88\x92C bond bridged dimers, [Mn2(salophen2)Na2(DME)4] (5) [salophen2 = C\xe2\x88\x92C bonded salophen dimer] and [Mn2(3,5-But4salophen2)Na2(DME)6] (7), respectively. Complexes 5 and 7 undergo a further two electron reduction to [Mn2(*salophen2*)Na4(DME)6] (6) [*salophen2* = C\xe2\x88\x92C doubly bonded salophen dimer] and [Mn2(*3,5-But4salophen2*)Na4(DME)4] (8), respectively, both containing a double C\xe2\x88\x92C bridge. The obtention of [Mn2{salophen(Me)CH2)}2Na4(DME)4] (9) from [Mn(salophen-Me2)(THF)]2 (2) strongly supports the existence of free radical precursors in the formation of C\xe2\x88\x92C bonds. Complex 6 has been used as a source of four electrons in a number of reactions, thus reduction of Ag+, PhCH2Cl, p-benzoquinone, and [CoII(MeOsalen)] occurs with the regeneration of the starting material 1. The C\xe2\x88\x92C bond cleavage is the source of electrons, without being involved in any reaction as a reactive site. With stronger oxidizing agents not only complexes 6 and 8 transfer the electrons stored at the C\xe2\x88\x92C bonds but also the metal undergoes a change in the oxidation state. The reaction of 6 with dioxygen produces a novel form of di-\xce\xbc-oxo-Mn(IV) dimers, where the salophen ligand displays a bridging bonding mode in [Mn2(\xce\xbc-salophen)2(\xce\xbc-O)2] (15) and [Mn2(\xce\xbc-3,5-Butsalophen)2(\xce\xbc-O)2] (16).

Magnetic susceptibility measurements taken on the three polymers indicate that the spins couple in one-dimensional chains with alternating exchange parameters:\xe2\x80\x89 J1 = \xe2\x88\x92190 cm-1, J2 = \xe2\x88\x92116 cm-1 (X = Cl); J1 = \xe2\x88\x92200 cm-1, J2 = \xe2\x88\x92110 cm-1 (X = Br); and J1 = \xe2\x88\x92271 cm-1, J2 = \xe2\x88\x92200 cm-1 (X = I). Variable temperature ESR measurements on the unstable monomeric complex resulting from reaction of BVD with (CH3O)3PCuI indicate an interradical exchange parameter J of \xe2\x88\x92230 cm-1. ESR spectra of all three complexes show extremely broad, featureless lines as a result of very rapid spin\xe2\x88\x92lattice relaxation. The reduction in exchange between the two halves of the bis(verdazyl) ligand upon coordination, and the unusual ESR properties, require a delocalized structure, with significant spin density on the copper atom. Variation of the auxiliary ligands on the copper atom allows tuning of the intramolecular exchange. "
Reaction of metallacrown and metallacalixarene platinum bistriflates with bipyridine as well as other bidentate connector ligands results in the formation of tetranuclear macrocycles via self-assembly that combine crown ether and calixarene chemistry with molecular squares. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry are employed to characterize these unique supramolecular species. The calixarene metallamacrocycles are used in simple transport experiments to carry sulfonate salts from one aqueous phase into another through chloroform. 
"The pKa of the title compound, 3, was determined kinetically to be 14.47 in 50% MeCN\xe2\x88\x9250% water at 25 \xc2\xb0C. Rate constants for the reversible deprotonation of 3 by OH- and piperidine, and primary kinetic isotope effects as well as kinetic solvent isotope effects for the deprotonation of 3 by OH- (OD-), are reported. Comparison of our results with corresponding data for methoxymethylcarbenepentacarbonylchromium(0) (2a), shows that the pKa of 3 is about 2 units higher than that of 2a. This reduction in acidity is mainly attributed to enhanced \xcf\x80-donation from the oxygen to the carbene carbon of 3, which results from the ring structure of 3. The intrinsic rate constants for the deprotonation of 3 are essentially the same as for the deprotonation of 2a. This suggests that the expected intrinsic rate lowering effect due to the increased resonance stabilization of 3 is offset by an intrinsic rate enhancing preorganization effect. "
"Mixtures of Pd(dba)2 + 2L-L (where L-L is a bidentate ligand such as dppm, dppe, dppp, dppb, dppf, and DIOP) lead to the formation of Pd(L-L)2 complexes which do not undergo an oxidative addition with phenyl iodide. Mixtures of Pd(dba)2 + 2 BINAP do not afford Pd(BINAP)2 but Pd(dba)(BINAP). Mixtures of Pd(dba)2 + 1L-L (L-L = dppm, dppe, dppp, dppb, dppf, DIOP, and BINAP) lead to Pd(dba)(L-L) complexes via the formation, at short time, of the complex Pd(L-L)2, except for dppf and BINAP where the complex Pd(dba)(L-L) is directly formed. Pd(dba)(L-L) is the main complex in solution but is involved in an endergonic equilibrium with the less ligated complex Pd(L-L) and dba. Pd(L-L) is the more reactive species in the oxidative addition with phenyl iodide. However, Pd(dba)(L-L) also reacts in parallel with phenyl iodide. From the kinetic data concerning the reactivity of these different catalytic systems in the oxidative addition with phenyl iodide, one observes the following order of reactivity:\xe2\x80\x89 Pd(dba)2 + 1DIOP > Pd(dba)2 + 1dppf \xe2\x89\xab Pd(dba)2 + 1BINAP. All these systems associated to one bidentate ligand are less reactive than Pd(dba)2 + 2PPh3. "
"The new compounds CsTaQ3 (Q = S, Se, and Te) have been synthesized through stoichiometric reactions of the elements with Cs2Qn reactive fluxes at 923 K. Their crystal structures have been determined by single-crystal X-ray methods. CsTaQ3 crystallize in the hexagonal space group \xe2\x88\x92P63/mmc with two formula units per cell. Crystal data:\xe2\x80\x89 CsTaS3, a = 7.266(2) \xc3\x85, c = 5.961(2) \xc3\x85, V = 272.55(10) \xc3\x853 (T = 115 K), Rw(F2) = 0.072 (NO = 114, NV = 11), R1 = 0.034; CsTaSe3, a = 7.500(1) \xc3\x85, c = 6.182(1) \xc3\x85, V = 301.15(7) \xc3\x853 (T = 115 K), Rw(F2) = 0.106 (NO = 112, NV = 11), R1 = 0.036; CsTaTe3, a = 7.992(4) \xc3\x85, c = 6.496(4) \xc3\x85, V = 359.3(4) \xc3\x853 (T = 115 K), Rw(F2) = 0.131 (NO = 111, NV = 10), R1 = 0.038. The compounds adopt the BaVS3 structure type and feature chains of face-sharing octahedra. The Ta5+ centers are displaced from the centers of the Q6 octahedra along the direction of the chains in a centrosymmetric fashion. Geometrical considerations and band structure calculations at the extended H\xc3\xbcckel and density functional (DFT) levels of theory suggest that the most likely distortion pattern is the one with all Ta5+ centers displaced in the same direction within a given chain. A second-order Jahn\xe2\x88\x92Teller effect is responsible for this distortion. Very weak interchain communication would result in a centrosymmetric structure. The chains are separated by 12-coordinate Cs+ cations. CsTaSe3 is an insulator. CsTaTe3 shows semiconducting behavior and is diamagnetic or weakly paramagnetic. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and high-temperature powder diffraction data indicate that CsTaTe3 undergoes a phase transition at \xe2\x89\x88493 K. "
"The structure and energy of the isobutonium cations, protonated isobutane, were studied by ab initio methods. At MP2(full)/6-31G** level, besides the C-isobutonium cation (5), the 2-H-isobutonium cation (6), and the 1-H-isobutonium cation (7), two additional structures, representing the van der Waals complex between methane and isopropyl cation (8) and hydrogen plus tert-butyl cation (9), could also be characterized. The energy increases in the order 9 < 8 < 5 < 6 < 7, indicating the lower energy of the van der Waals complexes. The experimental proton affinity of isobutane is in good agreement with the calculated values for the van der Waals complexes 8 and 9, indicating the facility of rupture of the three center bond in 5 and 6. On the other hand, the relative order of stability of the isobutonium cations can explain the experimental gas phase protonation of isobutane by small electrophiles, such as H3+ and H3O+, as well as the H\xe2\x88\x92D exchange in liquid superacid.

"The disubstituted boron cations CH3OBOCH3+ and CH3BCH3+ readily cleave CO and C\xe2\x88\x92C bonds in gaseous long-chain aldehydes and ketones in a dual-cell Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. Abstraction of OH by the borocations yields a hydrocarbon product ion that contains the entire carbon skeleton of the aldehyde or ketone. A competing abstraction of part of the carbonyl compound as a small aldehyde results in a borocation product that is indicative of the location of the carbonyl group in the neutral substrate. The mechanisms of these two reactions likely involve common intermediates formed via 1,2-hydride shifts in an initially formed B\xe2\x88\x92OC adduct. Both reactions are highly exothermic. The OH abstraction reaction is the thermodynamically favored pathway while aldehyde abstraction is kinetically favored by the smaller carbonyl compounds. The overall enthalpy change associated with the latter reaction is likely to be relatively insensitive to the size of the carbonyl compound. In contrast, the OH abstraction reaction becomes more exothermic as the size of the substrate increases. This results in a predominant hydrocarbon ion product for the larger aldehydes and ketones. "
"This paper describes the use of gold films that contain underpotentially deposited (upd) metal layers of copper or silver as substrates in the generation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The assembly of alkanethiols to form SAMs is compatible with the presence of the upd layer and forms a system that contains an interlayer of the upd metal that is between the gold substrate and the adsorbed organic monolayer. The assembly on these substrates can accommodate both polar and nonpolar tail groups, and the resulting SAMs span the range of wettabilities (\xce\xb8a(H2O) = <15\xc2\xb0 to 113\xc2\xb0). The SAMs on the upd substrates have highly organized structures that are distinct from those that form on the parent bulk metal surfaces. In addition, the upd metal has a more noble redox potential than the corresponding bulk metal and allows an expanded potential window in cyclic voltammetry. For example, ferrocene-terminated alkanethiolsdespite having redox potentials that are positive of bulk silvercan be assembled onto silver upd substrates and form stable electroactive SAMs. The presence of the upd layer improves the stability of alkanethiolate monolayers against both desorption at elevated temperatures and molecular exchange within thiol-containing solutions.

"Hydrothermal conversion of zeolite LTA by LiCl(aq) is an efficient synthesis route for zeolite Li-A(BW), LiAlSiO4\xc2\xb7H2O, resulting in highly crystalline materials. In the present work hydrothermal crystallization of zeolite Li-A(BW) was followed in situ by time resolved synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. These experiments were combined with ex situ scanning electron microscopy on partially converted samples. Fitting of the crystallization curves with rate expressions indicated limited nucleation and showed that intermediate amorphous or solute phases were not present in any significant amount. Partially converted samples were prepared in situ, making it possible to monitor the progress of crystallization and to determine the degree of conversion in each sample. Scanning electron microscope images of 40 and 60% converted samples showed that the parent zeolite LTA crystallites to a large degree serve as nucleation centers for the crystallization of zeolite Li-A(BW). The zeolite Li-A(BW) crystals grow radially from the nucleation site, forming clusters of flat needle-like crystals. The information obtained from the combined experiments clearly shows that the hydrothermal conversion of zeolite LTA into zeolite Li-A(BW) is a solution-mediated process. "
"NMR studies show that a 2,4-diethoxycalix[4]arene-1,3-diquinone undergoes an unusually slow conformational change, from a predominantly anti-aryl conformation to that of a syn-aryl conformation, in the presence of Na+ ion. Dramatic changes are observed throughout the entire NMR spectral region. A novel finding is that the timescale of this conversion is unusually long, taking many hours at room temperature to complete. The kinetics of this conformational change over the range of 5\xe2\x88\x9255 \xc2\xb0C were measured in a binary solvent system. The rate constants are on the order of 10-5\xe2\x88\x9210-4 s-1 in the presence or absence of Na+. These results suggest a cation effect on the equilibrium position of the anti and syn complexes rather than on the rate of interconversion. The kinetics of interconversion in the presence and absence of the salt are the same. The rate determining step corresponds to rotation of an aryl moiety through the annulus of the calixarene. Additionally, we note that the initially dominant anti-aryl conformer appears to be a kinetic product of the oxidation step of the synthesis with Tl(CF3CO2)3. Variable-temperature NMR studies in the absence of salt show a stable \xe2\x88\xbc4:1 ratio of anti to syn conformer, while the compound, as initially prepared in solution, exhibits a ratio of >50:1.

"The mechanism for the water-exchange reaction with the transition metal aqua ions from ScIII through ZnII has been investigated. The exchange mechanisms were analyzed on the previously reported model (Rotzinger, F. P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 6760) that involves the metal ion with six or seven water molecules. The structures of the reactants/products, transition states, and penta- or heptacoordinated intermediates have been computed with Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock or CAS-SCF methods. Each type of mechanism, associative, concerted or dissociative, proceeds via a characteristic transition state. The calculated activation energies agree with the experimental \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7298 or \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7298 values, and the computed structural changes indicate whether an expansion or compression takes place during the transformation of the reactant into the transition state. These changes are in perfect agreement with the changes deduced from the experimental volumes of activation (\xce\x94V\xe2\xa7\xa7298). The motions of the ligands involved in the exchange reaction are described by the imaginary vibrational mode. All these computed quantities allow the attribution of the water-exchange reactions to the A, Ia, or D mechanisms with use of the terminology of Merbach (Merbach, A. E. Pure Appl. Chem. 1982, 54, 1479). Within the present model, no transition state has been found for the Id mechanism. It remains to be verified, using an improved model, whether it really does not exist. The dissociative mechanism is always feasible, but it is the only possible pathway for high-spin d8, d9, and d10 systems. In contrast, the associative mechanism requires that the transition metal ion does not have more than seven 3d electrons. Thus, ScIII, TiIII, and VIII react via the A, NiII, CuII, and ZnII via the D (or Id) mechanism, whereas for the elements in the middle of the periodic table, the high-spin 3d3\xe2\x88\x923d7 systems, both associative (Ia/A) and dissociative (D) pathways are feasible. The present results suggest that for ScIII hexa- and heptacoordinated species could coexist in aqueous solution. "
"The application of an ensemble-averaging (EA) protocol to highlight conformational variability and to determine the interconverting conformations in NMR structure of cyclopeptides is described. Most of the NMR-based conformational studies of cyclopeptides reported in the literature rely on protocols that basically assume the existence of a single structure. This is sometimes referred as the one NOE (or ROE)/one distance hypothesis. In contrast, the EA protocol used in this work relies on a model that explicitly takes into account the averaging in NMR data and tests the significancy of the results which is very often disregarded in structure determination by NMR. This EA method was applied to the conformational analysis of the peptide cyclo(Gly-Pro-Phe-Gly-Pro-Nle) in DMSO by NMR. Qualitative analysis of the ROEs observed for this peptide indicates that it adopts the well-known double reverse turn structure. However, certain interproton distances derived from a set of ROESY experiments, as well as some coupling constants, are not compatible with the existence of a unique conformation but reflect the presence of several conformers in fast exchange on the NMR time scale. Therefore, structures consistent as ensemble with the NMR-derived restraints were determined using a restrained molecular-dynamics-based ensemble-averaging protocol which explicitly takes multiconformers into account and treats the restraints as ensemble-averaged quantities. The NMR-derived data used as input restraints in this EA protocol include the distance restraints (DR), the homonuclear coupling constants (J), and a large set of unambiguous antidistance restraints (ADR) that are generally disregarded in conformational analysis of cyclopeptides. The number of interconverting conformers was determined from the significance of the fit of the DR and ADR using the complete cross-validation method. The results shows that pairs of conformers give a satisfactory and significant fit of all NMR data. The conformational analysis of the interconverting partners reveals that the hexapeptide cyclo(Gly-Pro-Phe-Gly-Pro-Nle) exists in solution either as a \xce\xb2VIII-\xce\xb2II/i\xce\xb3-\xce\xb2I or a \xce\xb2II-\xce\xb2II/\xce\xb2I-\xce\xb2I equilibrium.

"The effect of helix unfolding on the rates of photoinduced electron transfer in model dichromophoric peptides was investigated. Two \xce\xb1-helical peptides, 1 and 2, having an alternating Ala-Aib backbone and differing only in the position of an appended electron donor (N,N-dimethylaniline) and an appended photoexcited electron acceptor (pyrene) relative to the electric field generated by the helix, had shown a difference in photoinduced electron transfer rates which had been ascribed to a helix dipole effect. Upon denaturation by protic solvents (EtOH, MeOH, H2O, CF3CH2OH) or guanidinium, the observed electron transfer rates in 1 and 2 became identical. The helix unfolding was studied by circular dichroism (CD) analysis. A second pair of model oligopeptides, 3 and 4, analogous to 1 and 2 but having l-proline (Pro) instead of \xce\xb1-methylalanine (Aib) incorporated into the backbone, were prepared in order to study unfolded peptides in low dielectric constant solvents. The CD, NMR, and steady-state fluorescence spectra in a variety of solvents establish that one of the chromophores experiences a different local environment in 3 than in 4 and that the two peptides have different average conformations.

"A reverse (water in oil) microemulsion has been designed to oxidize hydrophobic organic substrates with singlet oxygen (1O2, 1\xce\x94g) generated from the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by molybdate ions. The microemulsion was prepared by mixing methylene chloride, sodium dodecylsulfate, n-butanol, and aqueous molybdate. Flash photolysis studies have shown that in such media singlet oxygen exhibits a similar kinetic behavior that under homogeneous conditions (\xcf\x84\xce\x94 \xe2\x89\x88 42 \xce\xbcs). Various typical organic substrates have been oxidized on the preparative scale with this chemically generated singlet oxygen, and the expected oxidation products have been isolated in high yields. "
"A novel use of monoclonal antibodies to probe adsorbed protein conformation is described. Previous electrochemical studies (Zhang, D. B. et al. Anal. Chem. 1994, 66, 3873\xe2\x88\x923881) described the characteristics of the potential-dependent adsorption of Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Hildenborough) cytochrome c3 on a mercury electrode. Monoclonal antibodies were generated with epitopes in the vicinity of heme 1. These antibodies were utilized to confirm the existence of three conformationally distinct electrochemical forms depending upon the applied potentials of open circuit (\xe2\x88\xbc \xe2\x88\x920.05 V), \xe2\x88\x920.7 V, and \xe2\x88\x921.2 V vs AgCl/Ag reference. In all three conformations, the cytochrome c3 was in a denatured state when compared to soluble protein. When the charge on the electrode was changed from positive to negative (open circuit to \xe2\x88\x921.2 V), heme 1 remained oriented toward the solution even though the heme 1 region possesses a high positive charge.

"Large collections of de novo \xce\xb1-helical proteins can be constructed by using combinatorial methods based on a \xe2\x80\x9cbinary code\xe2\x80\x9d for protein design, in which the sequence locations of polar and nonpolar amino acids are specified explicitly, but the precise identities of these residues are varied extensively. We demonstrate that a 75-residue protein chosen from such a binary code collection displays several properties similar to those of native proteins:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) Both the chemically induced and thermally induced denaturations are cooperative; (ii) addition of the hydrophobic dye 1-analinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) yields only minimal fluorescence; (iii) the NMR spectrum shows significant chemical shift dispersion in both the amide and methyl regions; and (iv) amide protons are protected from exchange to an extent observed in some natural proteins. These results demonstrate that binary patterning of polar and nonpolar amino acids can serve as the basis for initial steps toward the design of novel proteins with native-like properties. "
"The reaction of dimethyltitanocene (Cp2TiMe2) with PhSiH3 in hexane in the presence of Cy2PH (Cy = cyclohexyl) is photoinitiated to give paramagnetic Cp2Ti(SiH2Ph)(PHCy2), characterized in solution by EPR spectroscopy (a(H) of phosphine = 4.8 G, a(P) = 26.9 G, giso = 1.9950). Under the same conditions, a similar reaction with Ph2SiH2 gives a crystalline solid, shown by an X-ray structure determination to be [(Cp2Ti)2(\xce\xbc-H)(\xce\xbc-PCy2)] (1). Under continuous photolysis Cp2TiMe2 reacts with CyPH2, in the presence of either PhSiH3 or Ph2SiH2, to give crystals of [Cp2Ti(\xce\xbc-PHCy)]2 (2). rac-[(EBTHI)Ti(\xce\xbc-H)]2 (EBTHI = ethylene-1,2-bis(\xce\xb75-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)) reacts with PhPH2 to give crystals of the complex (EBTHI)Ti(P2Ph2) (4). In this reaction, excess PhPH2 is polymerized by dehydrocoupling to a mixture of linear and cyclic oligophosphanes. The diphosphane is produced as an equal mixture of the two diastereoisomers. Due to precipitation of the highly insoluble 4, the catalytic reaction eventually ceases. The mechanisms of these reactions are discussed in terms of the oxidative addition of phosphines to Cp2TiII, conproportionation of Cp2TiII and Cp2TiIV to Cp2TiIII, and \xcf\x83-bond metathesis reactions of P\xe2\x88\x92H, Ti\xe2\x88\x92H, and Ti\xe2\x88\x92P compounds.

"Electron-diffraction patterns of the fullerene C70 in the gaseous state at 810\xe2\x88\x92835 \xc2\xb0C have been recorded in experiments similar to those recently described for C60. The radial distribution curve calculated from the scattered intensity is entirely consistent with a molecule of D5h symmetry. With assumption of this symmetry, 12 parameters are required to specify the structure. Reliable values are thus much more difficult to obtain for these parameters than for C60 whose structure is completely defined by only two parameters. Six different models were found that give excellent fits to the diffraction data. The models may be divided into two types characterized either by a shorter (1.4+ \xc3\x85) or a longer (1.5+ \xc3\x85) equatorial bond. Despite this difference, however, the average length of the eight bonds is similar in all models (1.434 \xc3\x85; average deviation 0.006 \xc3\x85). Since no model could be favored on the basis of the electron-diffraction data alone, a best model was selected from considerations of theoretical energies (BP86/TZP level of density functional theory) and by comparison of computed 13C NMR chemical shifts (gauge-including atomic orbitals, GIAO-SCF/TZP) with those from experiment. This model is in good agreement with structures determined in the crystal by neutron and X-ray diffraction, and with ab initio calculated structures (BP86/TZP), with one important difference:\xe2\x80\x89 the equatorial bond is some 0.06 \xc3\x85 longer. Based on assumed D5h symmetry, and designating the five circles of atoms from the top (capping) pentagon to the equator as a, b, c, d, and e, the bond lengths (ra/\xc3\x85) are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 r(a\xe2\x88\x92a) = 1.461(8), r(a\xe2\x88\x92b) = 1.388(16), r(b\xe2\x88\x92c) = 1.453(11), r(c\xe2\x88\x92c) = 1.386(25), r(c\xe2\x88\x92d) = 1.468(11), r(d\xe2\x88\x92d) = 1.425(14), r(d\xe2\x88\x92e) = 1.405(13), r(e\xe2\x88\x92e) = 1.538(19). The equatorial diameter of the ellipsoid is 7.178(50) \xc3\x85, and the distance between the polar pentagons is 7.906(64) \xc3\x85; quantities in parentheses are 2 esd. "
"A central event in the development of the allergic response is the interaction between immunoglobulin E (IgE) and its cellular high-affinity receptor Fc\xce\xb5RI. Allergen-bound IgE mediates the allergic response by binding through its Fc region to its cellular receptor on mast cells and basophils, causing the release of chemical mediators. One strategy for the treatment of allergic disorders is the use of therapeutic compounds which would inhibit the interaction between IgE and Fc\xce\xb5RI. Using a structure-based design approach, conformationally constrained synthetic peptides were designed to mimic a biologically active \xce\xb2-hairpin region of the \xce\xb1-chain of Fc\xce\xb5RI. Two peptide mimics of the Fc\xce\xb5RI \xce\xb1-chain were previously shown to inhibit IgE\xe2\x88\x92Fc\xce\xb5RI interactions, one a peptide comprised of l-amino acids, covalently cyclized by N- and C-terminal cysteine residues, and the other its retroenantiomer. In this paper the solution structures of these compounds are derived using NMR spectroscopy. The topochemical relationship between the retroenantiomeric compounds and the structural basis of their biological activity is described. "
"Spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations have been carried out on a collection of hydrogen-bonded mixed-valence adducts of ruthenium complexes. The electron donors (H-bond acceptors) are Ru(II) cyano species and the electron acceptors (H-bond donors) are Ru(III) ethylenediamine species, and NIR spectroscopic transitions in the adducts are assigned to intervalence transfer through the hydrogen bonds holding the adducts together (HBIT). Spectroscopic studies using Job\'s method indicate that the adducts are 2:1 ternary aggregates of formulations such as [((trpy)(bpy)RuII(CN))2,(en)2RuIII(bpy)]5+ and [((bpy)2RuII(CN)2)2,(en)2RuIII(bpy)]3+. Voltammetric investigations show substantial repulsion of the redox waves of the parent complexes in mixtures containing both donor and acceptor. Comparison with known electronic coupling data for mixed-valence ruthenium dimers covalently bound through dithiaspiroalkane bridging ligands indicates that the electronic coupling through H bonds of this type is 65\xe2\x88\x9275% as strong as through \xcf\x83-covalent bonds.

"Spectral, acid\xe2\x88\x92base, and redox properties of theaflavin radicals were studied by pulse radiolysis in aqueous solutions. Theaflavin radicals are generated by the azide radical one-electron oxidation of theaflavin, theflavin gallates A and B, and theaflavin digallate. Being relatively strong transient oxidant, N3\xe2\x80\xa2 oxidizes more than one phenolic site in the complex polyphenols. The resulting mixture of phenoxyl radicals transforms via an intramolecular electron transfer to the hydroxycycloheptenone radical, with apparently lowest reduction potential. The neutral hydroxycycloheptenone radical is more aromatic than the parent compound, which reflects in high rate constant of the formation of the radical. The rate of the reaction of theaflavin with the superoxide radical at pH 7, k = 1 \xc3\x97 107 M-1 s-1, is an order of magnitude higher than that with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), k = 7.3 \xc3\x97 105 M-1 s-1, in spite of higher reduction potential of the theaflavin radicals (E7 = 0.53 V vs E7 = 0.44 V for EGCG). Even the substitution in the adjacent benzene ring has relatively small effect on the electron density in the radical. Purpurogallin radical, with three hydroxy groups on the benzene ring, has pKr1 = 4.7 and E7 = 0.48 V, as compared to the theaflavin radical, with only two hydroxy groups on benzene, having pKr = 4.3 and E7 = 0.51 V. The electron donating ability of theaflavins, which are major antioxidants in black tea, is quantitatively assessed on the basis of physicochemical characteristics of daughter radicals and their potential biological action discussed.

"The effect of electric fields on the fluorescence decay of block-copolymers containing poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) and polynorbornene (polyNBE) was measured. Electric fields of up to 200 V/\xce\xbcm do not perturb the fluorescence decay profiles when the average size of the PPV block is small (i.e., PPV3-block-polyNBE200 or PPV3-block-polyNBE25). It appears that for short isolated PPV segments the electric field accessible for these studies does not allow dissociation of photogenerated excitons into electron-hole pairs. For larger PPV segments, as in PPV20-block-polyNBE200, the electric field reduces considerably the fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield. In addition, irradiating the sample under an electric field changes permanently its fluorescence characteristics. Control experiments show that neither irradiation nor the field alone can degrade the polymer. "

Intramolecular electron transfer from the singlet excited state of benzidine to the norbornadiene chromophore in N\xe2\x88\x92S\xe2\x88\x92B occurs with efficiency (\xce\xa6ET ) of ca. 12% and rate constant (kSET) of ca. 1.1 \xc3\x97 107 s-1, resulting in the singlet radical ion pair 1(N\xe2\x80\xa2-\xe2\x88\x92S\xe2\x88\x92B\xe2\x80\xa2+) followed by intersystem crossing to the triplet state 3(N\xe2\x80\xa2-\xe2\x88\x92S\xe2\x88\x92B\xe2\x80\xa2+). Recombination of 3(N\xe2\x80\xa2-\xe2\x88\x92S\xe2\x88\x92B\xe2\x80\xa2+) yields triplet norbornadiene group. The efficiency (\xcf\x86RIPISC\xc2\xb7\xcf\x86RIPRC) of the formation of the triplet norbornadiene from the radical ion pair is ca. 17%. The singlet excited state of benzidine group in N\xe2\x88\x92S\xe2\x88\x92B undergoes intersystem crossing to its triplet state with efficiency (\xce\xa6ISC) of ca. 56%. Intramolecular triplet energy transfer leading to the formation of the triplet norbornadiene chromophore is efficient (\xcf\x86TT = ca. 65%, kTT = ca. 5.2 \xc3\x97 105 s-1). Selective excitation of the benzidine chromophore results in isomerization of the norbornadiene group to quadricyclane. This isomerization proceeds either via intramolecular triplet sensitization or radical-ion pair recombination mechanism. The long-distance intramolecular triplet energy transfer and singlet electron transfer are proposed to proceed via a through-bond mechanism. "
"An ab initio molecular orbital study of through-bond (TB) orbital interactions has been carried out on several series of diene hydrocarbons, 2(n)\xe2\x88\x9217(n), in which the double bonds are covalently attached to a variety of rigid saturated hydrocarbon bridges with lengths, n, ranging from four to 17 C\xe2\x88\x92C \xcf\x83 bonds. The resulting TB \xcf\x80+,\xcf\x80- and \xcf\x80*+,\xcf\x80*- splitting energies, \xce\x94E(\xcf\x80) and \xce\x94E(\xcf\x80*), respectively, were obtained at the HF/3-21G level of theory. The distance dependence of \xce\x94E(\xcf\x80) and \xce\x94E(\xcf\x80*) for each type of diene was fitted to the respective exponential decay profiles, \xce\x94E(\xcf\x80) = A exp(\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb2hn) and \xce\x94E(\xcf\x80*) = B exp(\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb2en). It was found that both \xce\xb2h and \xce\xb2e were dependent on the nature of the hydrocarbon bridge. For example, \xce\xb2h is found to range from 0.6 per bond for 3(n) to only 0.05 per bond for 7(n) and 8(n). The \xce\xb2h values for the polynorbornane bridge dienes, 2(n), and the hybrid norbornane\xe2\x88\x92bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane bridge dienes, 3(n), are notably larger than that for the divinylalkanes, 4(n), and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analyses revealed this to be due to destructive interference effects between the two main relays of the bridges in 2(n) and 3(n). A simple intuitive model, based on the parity rule of TB coupling, was developed to explore interrelay interference effects in TB coupling along various saturated hydrocarbon bridges. The parity rule model was successfully used to design systems 5(n)\xe2\x88\x9216(n) in which the TB coupling between the two double bonds is greatly enhanced by constructive interrelay interference. For example, the absolute value for \xce\x94E(\xcf\x80) for the 15-bond diene 8(15) is 0.21 eV, an extraordinarily large quantity, considering that the double bonds are 17 \xc3\x85 apart, and \xce\xb2h for the series 8(n) is only 0.05 per bond. TB coupling in the \xe2\x80\x9csuperbridges\xe2\x80\x9d 7(n), 8(n), 11(n), 12(n), 15(n), and 16(n) can be up to two orders of magnitude stronger than that present in 2(n) and 3(n). The enhanced degree of TB coupling in the former systems translates into a predicted increase in the rate of hole transfer in the cation radicals of 7(14) and 8(15) of four orders of magnitude, compared to that for the cation radical of 3(14). NBO analyses of TB coupling in 5(n) and 9(n) revealed that strong interrelay interference may occur even when one of the relays is not electronically coupled to either double bond. It was found that the original version of the parity rule required modification so that it takes into account any change in parity of a coupling pathway caused by sign inversions between coupling orbitals. A relative parity rule of TB coupling is proposed which correctly addresses the topology of orbital overlap. Compared to \xcf\x80-TB coupling, TB interactions involving \xcf\x80* orbitals are less affected by interrelay interference, constructive or destructive. "
"The reactivity of enoxysilanes against aldehydes has been discussed theoretically in terms of the local electron-accepting ability and the Lewis acidic hardness of the silicon center. Those quantities have been evaluated by choosing a Si 3p atomic orbital that will play the major role in the formation of a new bond with the aldehyde oxygen and by projecting out the reactive unoccupied orbital for each enoxysilane molecule that shows the maximum amplitude on that AO. They change significantly depending on the arrangement of bonds around the silicon center. The activation energy calculated for the reaction of enoxysilanes with formaldehyde correlates well with both of the two quantities, showing that 1-enoxysilacyclobutane having a small C\xe2\x88\x92Si\xe2\x88\x92C angle is a stronger Lewis acid than methyl-substituted enoxysilanes. The acidic hardness of silicon in enoxysilane has been found to be very similar in magnitude to that of silicon in the corresponding allylsilane. In contrast, the \xce\xb3-carbon of an enoxy group has a higher electron-donating ability than that in an allyl group, suggesting that enoxysilanes are more reactive against aldehydes. "
"The reaction mechanism for the activation of C\xe2\x88\x92H bonds by coordinatively unsaturated CpM(PH3)(CH3)+ (Cp = cyclopentadienyl; M = Rh, Ir) has been investigated by ab initio molecular orbital methods. Of the two possible mechanisms, an oxidative addition\xe2\x88\x92reductive elimination process (path 1) and a \xcf\x83-bond metathesis mechanism through a four-center transition state (path 2), only the former is found for the 16-electron Ir cation, while the Rh case might adopt the latter. The reaction trajectory of path 1 for the approach of CpM(PH3)(CH3)+ to methane and the transition state structure can be predicted on the basis of a frontier molecular orbital model that determines the orientation of attack of the CpM(PH3)(CH3)+ fragment on a doubly occupied canonical fragment molecular orbital of methane. From which, four kinds of reaction paths (paths A, B, C, and D) can be deduced due to the asymmetric nature of CpM(PH3)(CH3)+. Both MP2 and QCISD results suggest that path A, where the methane C\xe2\x88\x92H bond breaks on the ancillary CH3 ligand side, is more favorable than other reaction paths kinetically and thermodynamically for both Rh and Ir cases. The calculational results strongly indicate that the reaction of the rhodium complex is intrinsically more difficult than that of the iridium complex. A qualitative model that is based on the theory of Pross and Shaik has been used to develop an explanation for the origin of the barrier height as well as the reaction enthalpy. "
"One- and two-dimensional 19F NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate the conformational heterogeneity of two arylamine-modified DNA duplexes, d[CTTCTTG*ACCTC]\xc2\xb7d[GAGGTCAAGAAG], in which G* is either N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4\xe2\x80\x98-fluoro-4-aminobiphenyl (dG-C8-FABP) (I) or N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-7-fluoro-2-aminofluorene (dG-C8-FAF) (II). The 19F NMR spectrum of I showed a single peak, while that of II revealed two prominent signals with a 55:45 ratio, in good agreement with previous 1H NMR results (Cho et al. Biochemistry 1992, 31, 9587\xe2\x88\x929602; 1994, 33, 1373\xe2\x88\x921384). Slow interconversion between the two conformations of II was established by temperature-dependent two-dimensional 19F NMR chemical exchange spectra. On the basis of magnetic anisotropy effects and isotopic solvent-induced shifts, the 19F signals at \xe2\x88\x92117.31 and \xe2\x88\x92118.09 ppm in the 19F NMR spectrum of II were assigned to a relatively undisturbed \xe2\x80\x9cB-type\xe2\x80\x9d conformer and a highly perturbed \xe2\x80\x9cstacked\xe2\x80\x9d conformer, respectively. Analysis of the temperature dependent (5\xe2\x88\x9240 \xc2\xb0C) line shapes by computer simulation yielded an interconversion barrier (\xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7) of 14.0 kcal/mol with a chemical exchange time of 2 ms at 30 \xc2\xb0C. This new 19F approach should be very useful in investigating the sequence-dependent conformational heterogeneity of arylamine-modified DNA. "
"The solid-state structure of the TMEDA complex of fluorenyllithium is investigated by the 6Li\xe2\x88\x9213C REDOR NMR experiment. The REDOR experiment was performed on 6Li-enriched samples with detection of the natural abundance 13C-signal. This simplifies the interpretation of the data and also the sample preparation. The dipole\xe2\x88\x92dipole couplings between the 6Li cation and the 13C nuclei, determined with the REDOR sequence, yields direct structural information. The distance information is also helpful when assigning the solid-state 13C NMR spectrum. The position of the Li cation is determined to within \xc2\xb10.2 \xc3\x85 (with respect to the fluorenyl framework). "
"Novel di(cation radical)s and tri(cation radical)s are prepared by oxidation of the corresponding 1,3-phenylenebis[[(4-tert-butylphenyl)methylene]triphenylphosphorane] and 1,3,5-benzenetriyltris[[(4-tert-butylphenyl)methylene]triphenylphosphorane] precursors. The oligo(cation radical)s are investigated in frozen solutions using ESR spectroscopy. The di(cation radical) has a triplet state as evidenced from a \xce\x94Ms = \xc2\xb12 ESR transition exhibiting hyperfine coupling to two identical phosphorus nuclei and is characterized by zero-field splitting parameters D = 350 MHz and E = 0 MHz. The corresponding tri(cation radical) possesses a quartet state with D = 262 MHz and E = 0 MHz and exhibits a \xce\x94Ms = \xc2\xb13 transition. Temperature dependent studies (4\xe2\x88\x92100 K) reveal that the ESR intensities follow Curie\'s law, consistent with high-spin ground states. The stability of these oligo(cation radical)s is assessed via cyclic voltammetry at room temperature in THF solution. "
"The majority of p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene inclusion compounds are 4-fold symmetric in the solid state, with the guest molecular and the host symmetry axes approximately aligned. In contrast, nitrobenzene (and related guests) induces a permanent symmetry-reducing distortion of the p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene compound and occupies a position in which the guest molecular axis is no longer aligned with that of the host. These compounds have been characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction as well as 13C CP-MAS and 2H NMR in the solid state. Introduction of propane as a second, minority guest in sufficient quantities induces the alignment of the nitrobenzene molecular axis with the host C4 symmetry axis. Nitrobenzene-d5 guest dynamics in the symmetric and asymmetric structures reveal a much stronger host\xc2\xb7guest interaction in the latter. The nature of the asymmetry is due to a cooperative effect rather than any intrinsic property of the individual p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene\xc2\xb7guest units. In general, this work give initial insight into the suitability of the p-tert-butylcalixarene[4]arene framework for crystal engineering and illustrates the close connection between dynamics and lattice symmetry and structure.

"This paper reports the development of \xce\xb2-strand mimic B, which duplicates the hydrogen-bonding functionality of one edge of a tetrapeptide \xce\xb2-strand. When attached to a tripeptide by a suitable linking group, \xce\xb2-strand mimic B forms a hydrogen-bonded antiparallel \xce\xb2-sheet structure, artificial \xce\xb2-sheet 2. \xce\xb2-Strand mimic B is based upon a 5-hydrazino-2-methoxybenzoic acid building block. The first half of the paper describes synthetic, IR and 1H NMR spectroscopic, X-ray crystallographic, and molecular modeling studies of 5-hydrazino-2-methoxybenzoic acid derivatives and related molecules. These studies establish that hydrazide derivatives of 5-hydrazino-2-methoxybenzoic acid adopt a conformation similar to that of a peptide \xce\xb2-strand and are suitable for use as \xce\xb2-strand mimics. The second half of the paper describes synthetic and 1H NMR spectroscopic studies of artificial \xce\xb2-sheet 2 and of controls 20 and 21, which resemble the peptidomimetic and peptide strands of 2. These experiments indicate that 2 adopts a conformation and hydrogen-bonding pattern similar to that of an antiparallel \xce\xb2-sheet and establish that \xce\xb2-strand mimic B can induce \xce\xb2-sheet formation in an attached peptide strand.

"The scalar coupling constants between protons, nitrogens, and phosphorus in the metal complex chloro(triphenylphosphine)bis[bis(1-pyrazolyl)methane]ruthenium(II) chloride, [RuCl(PPh3)(BPM)2]+Cl- (1), were measured with a set of specially adapted NMR experiments. The absolute sign of the coupling constants was determined by relating the signs of the measured couplings to that of a one-bond proton\xe2\x88\x92carbon coupling constant. A complete set of coupling constants >|0.4| Hz was obtained with use of a single sample with 99% 15N-labeled bis-pyrazolyl ligands. The data show that the two-bond 15N\xe2\x88\x9215N and 31P\xe2\x88\x9215N couplings across the metal center are significantly larger, if the two metal-ligating atoms are trans rather than cis with respect to one another. Furthermore, all trans couplings 2JPN and 2JNN are positive, while the corresponding cis couplings are negative or too small to be measured. The conformation dependence of the scalar coupling constants supports the rapid structural characterization of catalytically active organometallic complexes by NMR spectroscopy. The proposed set of NMR experiments includes HSQC experiments with small flip angles, a quantitative long-range 15N\xe2\x88\x9215N correlation experiment, and DQ/ZQ experiments for the determination of the sign and size of JNN and JPN coupling constants in linear spin systems.

"The O2-dependent oxidation of urate catalyzed by urate oxidase has been examined in order to identify the immediate product of the enzymatic reaction. Specifically labeled [13C]urates were utilized as substrates, and the time courses were monitored by 13C NMR. On the basis of chemical shift values and 18O labeling, the product of the reaction was identified as 5-hydroxyisourate. This identification was substantiated by calculation of the 13C NMR spectrum of 5-hydroxyisourate using ab initio density functional theory methods. The predominant tautomers of urate and allantoin in aqueous solution were identified from 13C NMR titration data; the ionization behavior of urate and 5-hydroxyisourate were also examined by computational methods. The nonenzymatic pathway for production of allantoin from 5-hydroxyisourate was delineated; the reaction proceeds by the hydrolysis of the N1\xe2\x88\x92C6 bond, followed by an unusual 1,2-carboxylate shift and decarboxylation to form allantoin. "
"Unique intramolecular rearrangement product ions have been observed in the product ion spectra of a number of peptides. Multiple stages of mass analysis (MSn), molecular modeling, and chemical modifications of peptides have been used to provide insight into the mechanism of this rearrangement reaction. The rearrangement process begins with a four-residue immonium ion that transfers a proton from the immonium nitrogen to the primary amine on the N-terminus. The proton transfer leads to the rearrangement of the peptide, exposing an internal amino acid on the terminus of the new ion. The internal amino acid that becomes the terminus of the new ion is then readily lost. The reaction seems to benefit from an extended experimental time frame available for reaction. The reaction is most prominent in quadrupole ion trap and Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance experiments, is observed under some conditions in a triple quadrupole, but is not seen in a sector instrument. Without previous knowledge of this process, the peptide sequence as determined by MS/MS could be misidentified. "
"The substrate specificity of cytochrome P450, defined as the ability of a compound to promote NAD(P)H and O2 utilization in the production of either organic or reduced oxygen metabolites, is largely determined by steric and hydrophobic interactions. P450 specificity may therefore be determined by the \xe2\x80\x9cfit\xe2\x80\x9d of a compound within the active site. A receptor-constrained three-dimensional screening program (DOCK) has been used to select 11 compounds predicted to fit within the P450cam active site and 5 compounds predicted to fit within the L244A P450cam but not wild-type active site. The 16 compounds were evaluated as P450cam substrates by measuring (a) binding to the enzyme, (b) stimulation of NADH and O2 consumption, (c) enhancement of H2O2 production, and (d) formation of organic metabolites. Seven of the compounds predicted to fit in the active site, and none of the compounds predicted not to fit, were found to be substrates. Compounds predicted to fit very tightly within the active site were poor or non-substrates. The L244A P450cam mutant was constructed, expressed, purified, and shown to readily oxidize some of the larger compounds incorrectly predicted to be substrates for the wild-type enzyme. The 5 ligands selected to fit the L244A but not wild-type sites were not detectable substrates, presumably because they fit too tightly into the active site. Retroactive adjustments of the docking program based on an analysis of the docking parameters, particularly variation of the minimum distance allowed between ligand and protein atoms, allow correct predictions for the activity of 15 of the 16 compounds with wild-type P450cam. The DOCK predictions for the L244A mutant were also improved by changing the minimum contact distances to disfavor the larger compounds. The results indicate that ligands that fill the active site are marginal or non-substrates. A degree of freedom of motion is required for substrate positioning and catalytic function. If parameters are chosen to allow for this requirement, P450cam substrate predictions based on ligand docking in the active site can be reasonably accurate. "
"The easily accessible C-nucleoside 2-amino-5-(2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxy-\xce\xb2-d-ribofuranosyl)pyridine (P) and its 3-methyl (MeP) and 2\xe2\x80\x98-O-methyl (POMe) derivatives were synthesized and incorporated as protonated cytidine equivalents in homopyrimidine oligodeoxynucleotides. Tm measurements indicate that oligonucleotides containing P or MeP have a higher affinity to double-stranded DNA over the pH range of 6\xe2\x88\x928 than 5-methylcytidine (MeC) containing oligonucleotides. This increase in stability is most pronounced above pH 7.0. The average increase in Tm/modification for the dissociation of oligonucleotide d(TTTTTMePTMePTMePTMePTMePT) from a 21-mer target duplex at pH 7.5 is 2.3 \xc2\xb0C relative to oligonucleotide d(TTTTTMeCTMeCTMeCTMeCTMeCT). The pH dependence and sequence composition effects are much less pronounced for MeP (and also P) containing oligonucleotides than for MeC containing ones. While oligonucleotide d(TTTMeCMeCMeCMeCTTTTMeCTTT) shows no longer any affinity to the target duplex above pH 6.5, oligonucleotide d(TTTMePMePMePMePTTTTMePTTT) displays preserved binding with a Tm of 32.5 \xc2\xb0C at pH 7.0 and even binds with a Tm of 23.3 \xc2\xb0C at pH 8.0. Oligonucleotides containing POMe show distinctly less stable triple helices. The average decrease in Tm/modification for oligonucleotide d(TTTTTPOMeTPOMeTPOMeTPOMeTPOMeT) at pH 6.5 is 6.7 \xc2\xb0C relative to the MeC containing oligonucleotide. DNase I footprint titration experiments indicate that d(TTTTTMePTMePTMePTMePTMePT) binds not only five times stronger to a 229 base pair DNA fragment than d(TTTTTMeCTMeCTMeCTMeCTMeCT) but also with higher selectivity. UV-melting experiments show that duplexes of d(TTTTTCTXTCTCTCT) (where X = P, MeP, or POMe) with their antiparallel Watson\xe2\x88\x92Crick complement are dramatically less stable (\xce\x94Tm < \xe2\x88\x9212 \xc2\xb0C) at pH 8.0 than the corresponding natural duplex. Thus the new bases P and MeP show Hoogsteen specific pairing behavior. "
"The first synthesis of a vitamin B12 A\xe2\x88\x92B-semicorrin 44 is described. Both A and B rings were prepared from the same precursor, enamide 40, which is obtained by a sequence of sigmatropic rearrangements and a biomimetic oxylactonization. The coupling has been achieved via Eschenmoser sulfide contraction. A\xe2\x88\x92B-semicorrin 44 allows a new approach toward vitamin B12 and other uroporphinoids. "
"Three fluorine-containing paclitaxel and docetaxel analogs, 3\xe2\x80\x98-dephenyl-3\xe2\x80\x98-(4-fluorophenyl)-3\xe2\x80\x98N-debenzoyl-3\xe2\x80\x98N-(4-fluorobenzoyl)paclitaxel (3), 3\xe2\x80\x98-dephenyl-3\xe2\x80\x98-(4-fluorophenyl)docetaxel (4), and 2\xe2\x80\x98,10-diacetyl-3\xe2\x80\x98-dephenyl-3\xe2\x80\x98-(4-fluorophenyl)docetaxel (5), are prepared and used as probes for the conformational analysis of paclitaxel and docetaxel in aqueous and nonaqueous solvent systems. The dependence of the 19F chemical shifts and the JH2\xe2\x80\x98-H3\xe2\x80\x98 values of these fluorinated analogs is examined through 19F and 1H variable temperature (VT) NMR measurements. The experiments clearly indicate highly dynamic behavior of these molecules and the existence of equilibrium between conformers, especially in protic solvents, i.e., DMSO-d6/D2O, CH3OD/D2O, and CH3OD, which have not clearly been recognized by the previous studies. The analysis of the VT NMR data in combination with molecular modeling including restrained molecular dynamics (RMD) has identified three key conformers, A, B, and C, in which conformer C possesses rather unusual nearly eclipsed arrangements at the C2\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92C3\xe2\x80\x98 bond. Conformers A and C are essentially the same as those identified by X-ray analysis of docetaxel and paclitaxel, respectively. RMD evaluation of conformer C in a simulated aqueous environment shows substantial stabilization of this conformer in protic solvents as compared to the other conformers. The 19F\xe2\x88\x921H heteronuclear NOE measurements of these fluoro analogs also support the structures of the three conformers. Conformers B and C form a hydrophobic clustering among the 4-fluorophenyl at C-3\xe2\x80\x98, the phenyl at the C-2 benzoate, and the methyl at the C-4 acetate moieties. Since conformer C appears to be the predominant molecular structure at ambient temperature in aqueous solvents, this conformer is likely to be the molecular structure of paclitaxel or docetaxel that is recognized at the tubulin binding site. This study has unambiguously demonstrated the usefulness of these \xe2\x80\x9cfluorine probes\xe2\x80\x9d for the solution structures and dynamic behavior of complex molecules such as paclitaxel and docetaxel.

"H2 and 1,2-W2(iBu)2(OiPr)4 react in hydrocarbon solvents to give the cluster W6(H)5(CiPr)(OiPr)12 (1) in 40% crystalline yield. W2(H)2(OiPr)4(dmpe)2 (2) and W4(H)4(OiPr)8(dmpm)3 (3) have been isolated in the presence of the chelating diphosphines Me2PCH2CH2PMe2 (dmpe) and Me2PCH2PMe2 (dmpm). Reactions involving the use of various isotopes reveal the importance of both \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-CH activation of the iBu ligand. An X-ray determination and NMR data reveal that 1 contains an octahedral W6 unit, W\xe2\x88\x92W = 2.58 to 2.85 \xc3\x85, supported by four bridging hydride ligands, seven bridging alkoxides, and one bridging isobutylidyne ligand in addition to five terminal OiPr and one terminal hydride:\xe2\x80\x89 W6(H)(\xce\xbc-H)4(\xce\xbc-CiPr)(\xce\xbc-OiPr)7(OiPr)5. Only one isomer is observed crystallographically, and the NMR data are indicative of its presence in solution. The cluster 1 is inert with respect to intramolecular ligand site exchange, which has allowed the detection of preferential hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation involving the terminal W\xe2\x88\x92H ligand while alcoholysis occurs preferentially at the terminal W\xe2\x88\x92OiPr site adjacent to three \xce\xbc-H ligands. In the solid state, compound 2 has four terminal OiPr ligands on one W atom and two dmpe ligands on the other:\xe2\x80\x89 (iPrO)4W(\xce\xbc-H)2W(dmpe)2, W\xe2\x88\x92W = 2.49 \xc3\x85. The locations of the two \xce\xbc-H ligands are inferred from the X-ray determination and their proposed locations are consistent with the hydride-locating program XHYDEX. In solution, 2 is fluxional and low-temperature 1H and 31P{1H} NMR spectra are consistent with the presence of two isomers, one of which is the same as that seen in the solid state while the other has the more symmetrical disposition of ligands (dmpe)(iPrO)2W(\xce\xbc-H)2W(OiPr)2(dmpe). Compound 3 contains a chain of four tungsten atoms with terminal W\xe2\x88\x92W distances of \xe2\x88\xbc2.5 \xc3\x85 and a central W to W distance of 3.6 \xc3\x85, bridged by three dmpm ligands. The solid-state molecular structure is proposed as (iPrO)3W(\xce\xbc-H)(\xce\xbc-OiPr)W(\xce\xbc-dmpm)3(\xce\xbc-H)W(\xce\xbc-H)2W(OiPr)4. The solution NMR data reveal that 3 is fluxional but that at low temperatures a structure akin to that formulated above is present. These results are discussed in terms of the developing chemistry of hydrido alkoxides of the early transition elements. "

All were found to favor octanol, and by implication the phospholipid bilayer membrane, by at least 104-fold. Transport of Na+ was assessed in both a phospholipid bilayer and in a bulk CHCl3 membrane phase. Addition of ionophores to the latter was found in some cases to strongly enhance CHCl3 phase hydration. An attempt to correlate transport rates determined in the two systems failed, suggesting that the carrier mechanism, required in the CHCl3 phase, does not apply to the tris(macrocyclic) compounds in the bilayer. Sodium transport rates were also assessed for these compounds by using the bilayer clamp technique. Although Na+ flux rates thus determined for 7\xe2\x88\x929 in the phospholipid bilayer did not correlate with results obtained by the 23Na-NMR technique, the traces are similar to those obtained with protein channels, further supporting the function of tris(macrocycle)s as channel formers.

"The product distribution in the photolysis of the triplet-excited azoalkanes 1a,b depends markedly on the type of solvent used; in contrast, the azoalkanes 1c,d, which undergo efficient deazatization from the singlet-excited state, display solvent-independent photobehavior. Thus, the aziranes 3 are produced essentially exclusively in polar protic solvents, while the housanes 2 predominate in nonpolar ones. The excellent correlation (r2 = 0.963, seven solvents) of the azirane 3b yield with Gutmann\'s AN solvent parameter reveals that a combination of solvent properties such as the polarity and polarizability of the medium and the hydrogen-bonding ability is decisive for the photoproduct distribution. That the observed solvent dependence derives from bulk medium effects is borne out by the similar product distribution for the hydroxy-substituted derivative 1f to that for the azoalkane 1b in benzene, i.e., the intramolecular hydroxy functionality in the azoalkane 1f is ineffective in influencing the photochemistry of the triplet azo chromophore. Selective formation of the aziranes 3 from the triplet-excited azoalkanes 1 in the polar protic solvents is rationalized in terms of solvent stabilization of the more polar transition state for \xce\xb2 cleavage (azirane 3) over that for the \xce\xb1 scission (housane 2). In marked contrast to the appreciable deuterium isotope effect for quenching of the singlet-excited azoalkanes by protic solvents, the lifetimes (laser-flash photolysis) and reactivity (product analysis) of the triplet azoalkanes are not affected by deuterium substitution.

"In aqueous solution (2 < pH < 8) the thermodynamically stable form of the 4\xe2\x80\x98-methoxyflavylium ion (AH+) is its hydrated derivative trans-4\xe2\x80\x98-methoxychalcone, Ct. The Ct compound shows a broad absorption band with \xce\xbbmax = 350 nm. In acid medium, irradiation of Ct with near-UV light causes strong spectral changes with five isosbestic points and appearance of a very intense band in the visible region with maximum at 435 nm, corresponding to the AH+ form. It has been shown that irradiation of Ct causes a trans \xe2\x86\x92 cis photoisomerization reaction (\xce\xa6 = 0.04 at \xce\xbbexc = 365 nm), which is followed by 100% conversion of the cis-chalcone form (Cc) to the AH+ ion. The AH+ ion is photochemically inactive and thermally inert in acid medium (half-life of the back conversion at 25 \xc2\xb0C in the dark is 815 days at pH 1.0 and 20 h at pH 4.3, respectively). At high temperature (>50 \xc2\xb0C) and/or pH \xe2\x89\xa53, however, AH+ can be quantitatively converted back to Ct (half-life of 15 min at pH 4.0 and 60 \xc2\xb0C). Owing to this unique behavior, this represents a novel molecular system in which the color can be controlled by light and changes in temperature and/or pH. The ability to photochemically convert the stable and colorless Ct form to the kinetically inert and colored AH+ form, and the possibility to reconvert AH+ to Ct at high temperature or by a pH jump make the system well-suited as the basis for an optical memory device with multiple storage and nondestructive readout capacity through a write\xe2\x88\x92lock\xe2\x88\x92read\xe2\x88\x92unlock\xe2\x88\x92erase cycle.

"A novel use of polymer supported glycosyl donor for stereoselective synthesis of \xce\xb2-manno glycoside is described. This system features the use of polymer support in an unprecedented manner, in which the polymer sector serves as a \xe2\x80\x9cgatekeeper\xe2\x80\x9d. Polymer supported thiomannoside 10 that carries a p-alkoxybenzyl group as a linker at C-2 position was synthesized. This compound was subjected to the conditions of \xce\xb2-mannosylation according to the procedure of p-methoxybenzyl assisted intramolecular aglycon delivery (IAD) to react with glycosyl acceptor 11. Treatment with DDQ afforded the mixed acetal 12 which was followed by the activation of the anomeric C-S linkage to initiate the IAD step. This process allows the product derived from IAD to be specifically released from the polymer to give the mixture which is highly enriched with the \xce\xb2-manno glycoside 13. Compatibility with the orthogonal glycosylation strategy was confirmed by the reaction with the glycosyl fluoride 11c, and resultant disaccharide 14 was further transformed into 16 which corresponds to the core trisaccharide structure of Asn-linked oligosaccharide.

" 6Li and 15N NMR spectroscopic studies of lithium diisopropylamide ([6Li]LDA and [6Li,15N]LDA) in toluene/pentane solutions containing a variety of mono- and polydentate ligands are reported. LDA forms exclusively dimers in the presence of n-BuOMe, Et2O, t-BuOMe, THF, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, 2,2-dimethyltetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, dimethoxyethane, N,N,N\xe2\x80\x98,N\xe2\x80\x98-tetramethylethylenediamine, and MeOCH2CH2NR2 (NR2 = NMe2, NEt2, pyrrolidino).

Treatment of LDA with trans-N,N,N\xe2\x80\x98,N\xe2\x80\x98-tetramethylcyclohexanediamine (TMCDA) or trans-1-(dimethylamino)-2-isopropoxycyclohexane in hydrocarbons afford exclusively monomers. Sparteine binds only reluctantly, giving a mixture of unsolvated oligomers and monomer. Competitions of the ethereal ligands vs TMCDA afford binding constants and associated free energies for dimer solvation which are correlated with those obtained previously for lithium hexamethyldisilazide.

"Dehydrobrominations of (\xc2\xb1)-2-exo-bromonorbornane (RBr) by lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) were investigated to determine the roles of aggregation and solvation. Elimination with LDA/n-BuOMe occurs by deaggregation of disolvated dimers via a monosolvated monomer transition structure (e.g., [i-Pr2NLi\xc2\xb7n-BuOMe\xc2\xb7RBr]\xe2\x80\xa1). In contrast, elimination by LDA\xe2\x88\x92THF displays THF concentration dependencies that are consistent with parallel reaction pathways involving both mono- and disolvated monomer transition structures. Elimination is markedly faster by LDA\xe2\x88\x92DME than by LDA with monodentate ligands and follows a rate law consistent with a transition structure containing a chelated monomeric LDA fragment. A number of hemilabile amino ethers reveal the capacity of different coordinating functionalities to chelate. A protocol based upon kinetic methods affords the relative ligand binding energies in the LDA dimer reactants. Separating contributions of ground state from transition state stabilization allows us to attribute the stabilizing effects of chelation exclusively to the transition structure. The importance of chelating ligands in LDA-mediated dehydrobrominations, but not in previously studied reactions of LDA, sheds light on lithium ion chelation. "
"The thermodynamic acidities of (CO)5CrC(OMe)CH2CH3 (3-Et), (CO)5CrC(OMe)CH2CH2CH2CH3 (3-Bu), and (CO)5CrC(OMe)CH(CH3)2 (3-Pr) have been determined in 50% acetonitrile\xe2\x88\x9250% water (v/v) at 25 \xc2\xb0C; after applying statistical corrections, the pKa values are 12.62 for 3-Et, 12.84 for 3-Bu, and 12.27 for 3-Pr. These pKa values are all lower than pKa = 12.98 for (CO)5CrC(OMe)CH3 (3-Me) determined previously and give an acidity order of 3-Me < 3-Bu < 3-Et < 3-Pr. If it is assumed that the main resonance structure of the conjugate anions of the carbene complexes has the negative charge delocalized onto the (CO)5Cr moiety (e.g., 3-Et-:\xe2\x80\x89 (CO)5C\xcc\x84rC(OMe)=CHCH3), the increased acidity with increasing alkyl substitution on the \xce\xb1-carbon can be understood as reflecting the well-known stabilization of alkenes by alkyl groups. Rate constants for the deprotonation of 3-Et, 3-Bu, and 3-Pr by OH- and by piperidine are also reported and compared with the corresponding rate constants for 3-Me obtained previously. They follow the order 3-Me > 3-Et > 3-Bu > 3-Pr, essentially opposite to the order of the thermodynamic acidities. This leads to negative Br\xc3\xb8nsted \xce\xb1-values which are reminiscent of the nitroalkane anomaly. The observed kinetic order is the result of a lowering of the intrinsic rate constant by alkyl substitution. Four factors are identified that contribute to this lowering. (1) The disproportionately weak development of the CC double bond at the transition state which prevents the latter from significantly benefiting from the alkene-stabilizing effect of the alkyl groups. (2) The disproportionately large negative charge on the \xce\xb1-carbon at the transition state that leads to a disproportionately strong destabilization of the transition state by the inductive/field effect of the alkyl groups relative to that of the product anion. (3) The destabilizing field effect of the alkyl groups on the partial negative charge on the hydroxide ion at the transition state. (4) Steric crowding at the transition state. Kinetic data on the hydrolysis of 3-Et, 3-Bu, and 3-Pr over a wide pH range are also reported. They support a previously proposed mechanism that involves rate limiting protonation of the conjugate anion of the carbene complex that is concerted with cleavage of the bond between the carbene carbon and the metal. With 3-Pr the hydrolysis is subject to catalysis by light. "
"The synthesis of the 13-keto-10-azabicyclo[7.3.1]enediyne core structure of dynemicin A has been achieved by two routes, Schemes 4 and 6. The chemistry of the 13-keto core structure is dominated by the unusually facile bridgehead enolization. Comparison of the rates of cycloaromatization of a variety of enediynes revealed that substantial rate differences occurred even though the distance between the bonding acetylenes was virtually identical. A non-radical cycloaromatization pathway, initiated by thiol addition to the enediyne system, was discovered, and the simple core amine 26 exhibits modest in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity. Finally, two methods for the synthesis of the naphtho[2,3-h]quinoline portion of dynemicin A are described, and both these compounds also exhibit antitumor activity. "

These ligands form dicopper(I) double helicates which have been investigated by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic techniques. The formation of helical isomers is shown to depend on the intramolecular interactions between the constituent helicands of the double helicate; 4\xe2\x80\x98-methyl substituents undergo steric interactions with the 4-substituent of the partner helicand, leading to a modest selectivity, although bulky 4-substituents decrease selectivity. In the absence of 4\xe2\x80\x98-substituents, the smaller pitch permits steric interactions between like 4-substituents of the component helicands. In each case, formation of the head-to-head helicate isomer is preferred. "
Diosmacyclobutanes Os2(CO)8(olefin) undergo facile exchange reactions with olefins and acetylenes. An associative mechanism is excluded by the observation of saturation kinetics as the concentration of the entering olefin (butyl acrylate) is increased. Multivariate analysis of the rate as a function of [C2H4] (determined from solubility measurements in decane/butyl acrylate mixtures) and [butyl acrylate] suggests a stepwise mechanism in which the departing olefin migrates to a terminal position and then undergoes associative exchange with the entering olefin. The straightforward dissociative exchange of the olefin ligands in Os(CO)4(olefin) shows saturation at much lower concentrations of entering olefin. 
"Variable-temperature 13C NMR does not show any evidence for intramolecular ethylene rotation in 1-13C. The rates of alkene dissociation for the propene (8) and trans-2-butene (7) adducts of Os2(CO)8 have been measured in hydrocarbon solution and compared with the rates of alkene dissociation from the corresponding Os(CO)4(alkene) adducts 6 and 9. The kinetic labilities of propene and trans-2-butene are reversed in the Os2(CO)8(alkene) and Os(CO)4(alkene) systems; propene is replaced 2.5 times faster than trans-2-butene in the Os2(CO)8(alkene) system, while trans-2-butene is replaced 55.9 times faster than propene in the Os(CO)4(alkene) system. We have used molecular mechanics to explore the reasons for this unusual reactivity pattern and have found that these results may be easily reconciled with a ring-opening mechanism for alkene replacement in the Os2(CO)8(alkene) system. We have confirmed that alkene exchange with Os(CO)4(alkene) is dissociative, in agreement with precedent. The secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effect (KIE) has been measured for the replacement of C2H4 and C2D4 in Os2(CO)8(\xce\xbc-\xce\xb71,\xce\xb71-C2H4) (1) and Os2(CO)8(\xce\xbc-\xce\xb71,\xce\xb71-C2D4) (1-d4); it is 1.30(1) at 39 \xc2\xb0C. The measured KIE is consistent with a ring-opening associative mechanism for alkene exchange (mechanism II in the previous paper). "
"Complexes between cobalt(III) and eight different 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen) as well as two tris(3-aminopropyl)amine (trpn) derivatives are reported with varying numbers and structures of peralkylammonium groups in side chains of the ligands. The presence of additional positive charges has small effects on hydrolysis rates of nitrophenyl- and bis(nitrophenyl)phosphate esters but leads to substantially enhanced cleavage of plasmid DNA. Increasing the number of the charged side groups and/or their distance to the metal ion center provides for better binding to the DNA groove, as shown also by affinity measurements with calf-thymus DNA. In line with this, saturation kinetics of plasmid DNA cleavage yield a corresponding increase of efficiency in Michaelis\xe2\x88\x92Menten-type KM values, with rather constant kcat parameters. A binuclear cobalt complex with two cyclen centers separated by a \xe2\x88\x92(CH2)6-N+(CH3)2-(CH2)6-N+(CH3)2-(CH2)6\xe2\x88\x92 spacer shows, with only 5 \xc3\x97 10-5 M catalyst concentration, the largest known rate enhancement factor of >107 (corresponding to >1011 at 1 M) against DNA; incubation with 0.05 mM at 37 \xc2\xb0C for only 2 h leads to almost complete cleavage without appearance of products typical for redox cleavage. These results are in contrast to experiments with corresponding copper(II) complexes with added hydrogen peroxide, which has no effect with corresponding Co, Zn, Cd, or Ni complexes. "
"[Ni(EtN2S2)] (1) (EtN2S2 = N,N\xe2\x80\x98-diethyl-3,7-diazanonane-1,9-dithiolate) and [Ni(S4)] (2) (S4 = 3,7-dithianonane-1,9-dithiolate) react with [Fe4S4I4]2- to afford the neutral clusters [{Ni(EtN2S2)}2Fe4S4I2] (3) and [{Ni(S4)}2Fe4S4I2] (4), respectively. Metathesis with potassium arenethiolates yields the clusters [{Ni(EtN2S2)}2Fe4S4(Stip)2] (5) and [{Ni(S4)}2Fe4S4(Stip)2] (6) (tip = 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzene). Alternatively, the latter compounds can be synthesized by action of the corresponding Ni complexes on [Fe4S4(Stip)2L2] (L = 2,3-dimethyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazoline-5-thione), where the neutral ligands are displaced by the Ni complexes. As elucidated by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, 3, 5, and 6 are composed of an [Fe4S4]2+ unit and two Ni(II) complexes and the Ni and Fe centers are bridged via one and two \xce\xbc2-sulfur atoms from either the EtN2S2 or the S4 ligands. In 3 and 5 two N and two S (thiolate) atoms serve as donors for a square planar coordinated Ni(II) ion, whereas 6 contains two Ni(II) ions in a square planar S2 (thioether) S2 (thiolate) environment. The structures of the NiFe heterometallic clusters are discussed and related to the structures of the active sites of Ni containing CO dehydrogenases/acetyl-CoA synthases. As demonstrated by 1H-NMR spectroscopy, 3, 5, and 6 retain their bridged structures in solution. However, the spectra of 5 and 6 can be interpreted in terms of a symmetrical bidentate coordination of both Fe4S4-bound Ni complex fragments, which would be in contrast to the unidentate (5) or unsymmetrically bidentate (6) binding observed in the solid state. The redox properties of clusters 3, 5, and 6 were determined by cyclic voltammetry. In dichloromethane solution 5 exhibits two quasi-reversible oxidation processes at 0 and +485 mV and one quasi-reversible reduction wave at \xe2\x88\x921050 mV (vs SCE). "
"We describe a deterministic approach to conformational searching. The algorithm is a best-first, depth-first traversal of the conformer graph, i.e., a graph generated by a small set of deterministic deformation operators. No deformation operator is ever applied to the same starting structure more than once. Thus, this algorithm avoids the source of diminishing returns, common in Monte Carlo searches, that is caused by the rising probability that a given starting structure is subjected to the same or similar perturbations more than once. We apply this technique to the task of finding all locally optimal conformations of cycloheptadecane whose MM2 energies lie within 3 kcal/mol of its global optimum. This task, which is considered to be challenging for contemporary algorithms and computer hardware, was used by Saunders et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990, 112, 1419\xe2\x88\x921427) as a benchmark for comparing existing techniques in terms of their efficiency and thoroughness. The new algorithm compares favorably, by both criteria, with all of the methods tested by Saunders et al. Moreover, the conformer graph can be used for an analysis of the potential-energy surface that is not directly made possible by other search methods. The particular set of deformation operators used is specialized for medium-sized ring molecules. Ways to design deformation operators for larger molecules such as proteins are suggested. "
"An ab initio investigation of the chemical vapor deposition of AlN from the AlCl3NH3 adduct is presented. Geometries, harmonic vibrational frequencies and relative energies for the AlCl3NH3 adduct, its dissociation products AlCln, NHn (n = 1\xe2\x88\x923), and ring and cluster compounds [(Cl2AlNH2)n (n = 1, 2), (ClAlNH)n (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6)] are discussed. The Al\xe2\x88\x92N bond lengths in the investigated compounds are strongly dependent on the coordination numbers of the aluminum and nitrogen centers, decreasing from 2.0 \xc3\x85 for 4-coordinated Al/N centers to 1.79 and 1.68 \xc3\x85 for 3- and 2-coordinated Al/N centers, respectively. Thermodynamic analysis shows that dissociation of ClxAlNHx (x = 2, 3) compounds with elimination of HCl and simultaneous formation of oligomeric forms is preferable to the process of dissociation into components or simple HCl detachment. Under standard conditions gaseous 4-coordinated Al/N compounds (ClAlNH)6 and (ClAlNH)4 are more stable than 3-coordinated (ClAlNH)2 and (ClAlNH)3 compounds. In 4-membered rings and clusters, the electrostatic repulsion between nearby Al\xe2\x88\x92Al and N\xe2\x88\x92N atoms makes reorganization to 6-membered rings extremely favorable. The suggested mechanism of AlN deposition involving cluster formation in the gas phase is discussed. "
"A molecular dynamics simulation of ferrous and ferric ions in water has been performed to study the mutual orientations of the [Fe(H2O)6]2+ and [Fe(H2O)6]3+ complexes at a reactive separation of 5 \xc3\x85 in water. The study shows that although the conventional 3-fold 3-fold approach of the two hexaaquo octahedral complexes is the most dominant, the C3 axes facing each other on the two complexes are not directed along the Fe2+\xe2\x88\x92Fe3+ axis in aqueous solution. The extent of the dominance of different mutual orientations is presented. "
"Ethylmethylcarbene (1), cyclobutylidene (2), 2-norbornylidene (3), and 2-bicyclo[2.1.1]-hexylidene (4) and the transition states that correspond to 1,2-H-migration, 1,3-H-migration, and 1,2-C-migration were optimized at BHandHLYP/DZP, MP2/DZP, and CCSD(T)/DZP levels of theory. The 1,2-H-migration of 1 to 2-butene has a theoretically derived barrier of 5.2 kcal/mol at CCSD(T)/DZP. The 1,2-H-shift that leads to 1-butene has a \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 of 8.5 kcal/mol, 1,3-H-migration of 8.3 kcal/mol and 1,2-C-migration of 18.1 kcal/mol. For 2 \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 for 1,2-C-migration is only 10.5 kcal/mol, which is 7.6 kcal/mol less than for 1. This lowering of the barrier for rearrangment of cyclobutylidene is attributed to the similarity between the TS and singlet 2 which prefers a nonclassical structure. The barrier for 1,2-H-migration for 2 is 9.7 kcal/mol due to H repulsion in the TS. For 3 the process with the lowest barrier (5.2 kcal/mol, BHandHLYP/DZP) is a 1,3-H-shift that leads to nortricyclene. The preference for this rearrangement can again be explained by the similarity between the carbene geometry and that of the corresponding TS that leads to the nortricyclene. For the rearrangement of 4, which also resembles the TS for 1,3-H-migration, the corresponding TS has a \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 of 22.6 kcal/mol (BHandHLYP/DZP). The reason for this diverging behavior is the large amount of ring strain present in the TS for 1,3-H-migration of 4. As a consequence, 4 is a long-lived, trappable carbene that rearranges slowly to form bicyclo[2.1.1]hex-2-ene (\xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 16.2 kcal/mol), while 3 can not be trapped with pyridine. "
"A considerable body of unimolecular electron-transfer rate data has been reported recently for Ir2 excited-state donors linked to substituted pyridinium acceptors. These data pose a substantial paradox. Simple analysis suggested that donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor coupling matrix elements differ by 1 order of magnitude for the excited triplet and singlet states. Yet, there is no fundamental reason to expect this large electronic coupling dependence on spin state. We offer an alternative self-consistent interpretation based on a hybrid theoretical analysis that includes ab initio quantum calculations of electronic couplings, molecular dynamics simulations of molecular geometries, and Poisson\xe2\x88\x92Boltzmann computations of reorganization energies. Taken together the analysis provides a detailed comprehensive interpretation of these reactions. In our analysis, we reach the conclusions:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) that reorganization energies in these systems (\xe2\x88\xbc1.3\xe2\x88\x921.7 eV) are larger than expected from simple analysis of experiments, (2) that electronic couplings (\xe2\x88\xbc0.005\xe2\x88\x920.02 eV) are also larger than previously believed and differ only by a factor of 2 for singlet and triplet states, (3) that the molecules have access to multiple conformations differing both in reorganization energy and electronic coupling, and explicit treatment of this flexibility is crucial to interpret the rate data, and (4) that a considerable dip is expected in the donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor coupling dependence on tunneling energy, associated with destructively interfering electron and hole-mediated coupling pathways, which probably leads to a small observed ET rate in one of the compounds. Taken together, this analysis explains most of the experimental data. Fundamental arguments and detailed computations show that the influence of donor spin state on long-range electronic interactions is relatively weak. Many of the molecular aspects that establish the ET characteristics of these molecules exist in other semirigid model compounds, making this hybrid theoretical strategy of general interest. "
"N-Formyl-3,3\xe2\x80\x98,4,4\xe2\x80\x98-tetrahydrospiro[naphthalene-1(2H),2\xe2\x80\x98(1\xe2\x80\x98H)-pyridine] (2) and N-Formyl-3\xe2\x80\x98,4\xe2\x80\x98-dihydrospiro[indan-1,2\xe2\x80\x98(1\xe2\x80\x98H)-pyridine] (3) were resolved into enantiomers, compound 3 partly and compound 2 completely, by chromatography on triacetylcellulose. The CD spectra were recorded and compared with theoretical spectra calculated by a semiempirical method, using geometries from empirical force-field calculations. In the observed CD spectra, the carbonyl n \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* transitions did not give rise to visible bands, but their signs and energies were found by analysis of CD spectra in solvents of different polarity. The theoretical spectra of 2 and 3 showed complete agreement with the observed spectra in sign and qualitatively in intensity, for the five transitions observed between 190 and 280 nm, which permitted a safe assignment of the absolute configurations. The enantiomers of 2 and 3 with the aryl rings located on the same side of the tetrahydropyridine ring showed CD spectra, which were nearly mirror images, thus demonstrating the risk of deducing absolute configurations by a direct comparison of CD spectra.

"The calix[4]arene derivative 3 substituted at the wider rim by four urea residues was prepared in three steps from the corresponding tert-butyl calix[4]arene 2a. Due to the different ether residues attached to the narrow rim its constitution is C2v-symmetrical, and the hydrogen bonded dimers 3\xc2\xb73 formed in benzene have C2-symmetry. Thus, the 1H NMR spectrum not only gives an unambiguous proof for the dimerization but also allows the determination of the exchange rates for four sets of protons by NOESY experiments. The rate constant for the dissociation/dimerization kd = 0.26 \xc2\xb1 0.06 s-1 is in reasonable agreement with the rate constant for the exchange of included and free benzene ke = 0.47 \xc2\xb1 0.1 s-1. It was also shown that the formation of dimers is induced by the presence of suitable guest molecules like benzene. "
"The ring-opening reaction of the cyclobutene radical cation was studied by using Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock and density functional theory as well as various correlated MO methods. The species involved in three different mechanisma concerted C2-symmetric, a concerted C1-symmetric, and a stepwise C1-symmetric pathway have been considered. It is shown that any symmetric pathway is dominated by state symmetry selection rules which determine the outcome of the reaction. The concerted C2-symmetric pathway is subject to a pseudo-Jahn\xe2\x88\x92Teller distortion and leads to trans-butadiene. This pathway is approximately 5 kcal/mol higher in energy than the concerted C1-symmetric pathway, leading to cis-butadiene. Based on the results presented here, the stepwise C1-symmetric or \xe2\x80\x9cnonelectrocyclic\xe2\x80\x9d pathway discussed in the literature is an artifact of an overestimation of the radical stability by MP2 and minimum basis set ab initio methods. It is therefore concluded that the ring opening of the cyclobutene radical cation proceeds via a concerted, unsymmetric pathway to cis-butadiene. The results from Becke3LYP calculations for geometries, energies, and isotropic hyperfine coupling constants are in good agreement with the available experimental data and with QCISD(T)/QCISD calculations. The results from the different methods are discussed with respect to the experimental data, and the implications of the data presented here for future computational studies of radical ion reactions are considered.

"Homogeneously mixed molecular assemblies of defined stoichiometry were created by adsorption of asymmetric, trifunctional ligands on gold and CuInSe2 (CISe). The ligands rely on cyclic disulfide groups for binding to the substrate and can in addition possess two different substituents, one polar substituent (p-cyanobenzoyl or anisoyl) and one long-chain, aliphatic residue (palmitoyl). Because the substituents are covalently connected, no phase segregation will occur upon surface binding. Adsorption of these ligands on conducting surfaces changed both the surface potential (because of the polar substituent) and hydrophobicity (because of the aliphatic residue). Larger changes of surface potential were obtained by adsorption of the symmetric, dipolar ligands than by adsorption of the asymmetric ligands, and larger changes occurred on gold than on CuInSe2 (up to 1.2 V between extreme modifications on Au and 0.3 V on CISe). The magnitude and direction of the observed contact potential difference changes were found to depend on the extent of coverage (as derived from electrochemical and contact angle measurements) and on the orientation of the ligands (estimated from ellipsometry and FTIR data) and could also be reconstructed using a simple, electrostatic model. These findings demonstrate that the present methodology enables simultaneous grafting of two desired properties onto solid surfaces and illustrate the predictive power of a simple, electrostatic model for molecule-controlled surface engineering.

"Information about excited states of radical ions can enable their use as powerful oxidizing and reducing agents capable of driving chemical reactions. This article presents the first measurements of fluorescence from an excited state of the radical anion of 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ-), and the first report of a fluorescence quantum yield from any radical anion. BQ- was observed in both a 77 K 2-methyltetrahydrofuran matrix and a room temperature isooctane solution. The low fluorescence quantum yield, \xcf\x86f = 0.003, and the presence of a 0.5 eV red shift of the emission band edge (593 nm) from the absorption band edge (475 nm) imply that the lowest energy transition in BQ-, which is the source of the weak fluorescence, is formally forbidden. This conclusion is supported by both semiempirical and ab initio molecular orbital calculations. In addition, we determined the excited state lifetime of BQ- at 77 K to be 63 ns, with an excited state absorption spectrum peaking at 415 nm. "
"Sulfur-centered radicals derived from dithiothreitol (DTT) have been generated radiolytically in aqueous solution in the neutral to acid pH range. In the presence of O2, these are eventually transformed by a chain reaction into dihydroxydithiane (ox-DTT) and H2O2. In acid solution, the chain character of the reaction becomes more pronounced with decreasing pH. The radiolytic yield of the products (G value) also depends on the DTT concentration and the dose rate. The HO2\xe2\x80\xa2 radical carries the chain, abstracting an H atom from the DTT molecule (k = 120 dm3 mol-1 s-1), while its conjugated base, the O2\xe2\x80\xa2- radical (pKa(HO2\xe2\x80\xa2) = 4.8), does not react with DTT. The chain is continued when the DTT-derived radicals react with O2, yielding ox-DTT and HO2\xe2\x80\xa2 radicals. The self-termination of the HO2\xe2\x80\xa2/O2\xe2\x80\xa2- radicals breaks the chain. "
"Enantioselective total syntheses of the pentacyclic 5,11-methanomorphanthridine Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (\xe2\x88\x92)-montanine (1), (\xe2\x88\x92)-coccinine (2), and (\xe2\x88\x92)-pancracine (3) were accomplished using an intramolecular concerted pericyclic allenylsilane imino ene cycloaddition as a key step. These complex natural products were constructed starting from readily available enantiomerically pure epoxy alcohol 15 which was converted to allenylsilane aldehyde 28 via an efficient nine-step sequence. The imine generated from aldehyde 28 and iminophosphorane 47 underwent a stereospecific thermal imino ene reaction to afford key intermediate cis aminoalkyne 49. It was possible to transform this compound via Lindlar hydrogenation followed by an intramolecular Heck reaction to seven-membered ring tetracycle 51. This olefinic intermediate could be functionalized through its epoxide to yield \xce\xb1-hydroxymethyl intermediate 54, and then pentacyclic alcohol 64. Procedures were then developed to convert this material to the enantiomerically pure alkaloids 1\xe2\x88\x923. A formal enantioselective total synthesis of (\xe2\x88\x92)-brunsvigine (4) was also achieved via triol 72. "
"The development of mechanistic strategies for the modification of enzyme function is of considerable biotechnological interest. We now report that replacement of the catalytically important residue Asn-74 by aspartic acid (N74D) in the N-terminal domain of Escherichia coli asparagine synthetase B (AS-B) confers nitrile hydratase activity upon the mutant enzyme. Furthermore, while wild type AS-B can efficiently catalyze the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate, the N74D AS-B mutant exhibits very low glutaminase activity. These results are consistent with similar experiments on papain, supporting the hypothesis that mutation of a critical active site residue to affect the partitioning of an intermediate common to multiple reaction mechanisms may represent an approach by which enzymes can be obtained with different catalytic function. Our experiments also provide the first direct chemical evidence for a close mechanistic relationship between papain, a thiol protease, and AS-B, a class II Ntn amidotransferase. These enzymes are not likely to have arisen by evolution from a common ancestral protein. "
"Stable, aglycon-specific inactivators of glycosidases have considerable potential as tools in the study of mechanisms of oligosaccharide processing, and possibly as avenues toward new therapeutics. Glycosidases for which the rate-determining step with the natural substrate is the hydrolysis of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate are shown to be inactivated by the 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxy-2\xe2\x80\x98-fluoro derivative of this substrate. Thus Agrobacterium faecalis \xce\xb2-glucosidase is inactivated by 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxy-2\xe2\x80\x98-fluorocellobiose according to inactivation parameters of ki = 0.018 min-1 and Ki = 20 mM. Inactivation is shown to occur via the accumulation of the same 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglycosyl-enzyme intermediate as that formed using activated 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglycosides by identification of the labeled peptide in proteolytic digests. Thus, interactions between the enzyme and the sugar aglycon provide sufficient transition state stabilization to allow formation and trapping of the glycosyl-enzyme. \xce\xb2-Glucocerebrosidase, a \xce\xb2-glucosidase specific for hydrolysis of glucocerebrosides, is not inactivated by 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxy-2\xe2\x80\x98-fluorocellobiose, thereby demonstrating the aglycon specificity of this class of inactivator. "
" The binding of 2,7-diazapyrene (DAP), N-methyl-2,7-diazapyrenium monocation (MDAP), and N,N\xe2\x80\x98-dimethyl-2,7-diazapyrenium dication (DMDAP) to calf thymus DNA has been studied with respect to molecular geometry and thermodynamics. It is concluded from flow linear dichroism (LD) and induced circular dichroism (CD) spectra that the three diazapyrenes bind by intercalation to alternating AT as well as GC polynucleotide duplexes, as indicated by strong interactions with the transitions of the nucleobases in conjunction with approximately perpendicular orientations of the in-plane symmetry axes relative to the DNA helix axis. The reduced LD (LDr = LD/Aiso) of the DNA complexes is characterized by marked fine structure, decreasing in the order DAP > MDAP > DMDAP. This finding is interpreted in terms of a microscopic heterogeneity associated with rotational mobility of the ligand in a tilted intercalation pocket, with the dication DMDAP having less rotational freedom than the neutral DAP has. Other distinct differences between the three diazapyrenes are revealed in their thermodynamic parameters of binding. DAP binds with a negative \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 (\xe2\x88\x929 kcal/mol) and a negative \xce\x94S\xc2\xb0 (\xe2\x88\x927 cal/(mol K)), whereas the binding of the dication DMDAP is entropically driven (+43 cal/(mol K)) but enthalpically disfavored (+5.2 kcal/mol), the monocation MDAP having an intermediate position (\xce\x94H\xc2\xb0= \xe2\x88\x923 kcal/mol, \xce\x94S\xc2\xb0 = +12 cal/(mol K)).

"The palladium-catalyzed cycloisomerization of acyclic bisdienes to cyclized enedienes defines a novel strategy for the stereoselective cyclization of certain unsymmetric bisdiene substrates to form functionalized five- and six-membered rings. The full details of our investigation into this novel cycloisomerization, including our observations on substrate requirements, stereoselectivity, the influence of the catalyst precursor, and some mechanistic insights drawn from deuterium labeling studies, are discussed.

"With the use of an NMR-based method, potent (IC50 < 25 nM) nonpeptide inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinase stromelysin (MMP-3) were discovered. The method, called SAR by NMR (for structure\xe2\x88\x92activity relationships by nuclear magnetic resonance), involves the identification, optimization, and linking of compounds that bind to proximal sites on a protein. Using this technique, two ligands that bind weakly to stromelysin (acetohydroxamic acid, KD = 17 mM; 3-(cyanomethyl)-4\xe2\x80\x98-hydroxybiphenyl, KD = 0.02 mM) were identified. On the basis of NMR-derived structural information, the two fragments were connected to produce a 15 nM inhibitor of this enzyme. This compound was rapidly discovered (less than 6 months) and required only a minimal amount of chemical synthesis. These studies indicate that the SAR by NMR method can be effectively applied to enzymes to yield potent lead inhibitorsan important part of the drug discovery process. "
"In the preceding paper,1 we reported on the discovery of potent, nonpeptide inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinase stromelysin that were prepared by linking two ligands which bind weakly to adjacent sites on the protein. Here we describe the enthalpic and entropic contributions to the observed binding energy for both the linked and unlinked compounds using isothermal titration calorimetry. The results of the calorimetric experiments were interpreted on the basis of NMR-derived structures of stromelysin/inhibitor complexes. In addition, enzyme kinetic assays were performed to measure the cooperative binding of the untethered ligands. For the untethered compounds, the presence of acetohydroxamic acid increases the binding energy of biaryl ligands by \xe2\x88\xbc1.3 kcal/mol. This gain in energy is enthalpic in nature and can be attributed, in part, to a direct dispersion interaction between the two ligands. For the linked compounds, enthalpic contributions to the binding energy depend critically on the linker length, whereas the entropic contributions show virtually no dependence. The significant gains in enthalpy observed for a compound which linked the hydroxamate to the biaryl with a two methylene bridge was not observed for compounds with longer linkers due to a difference in the position of the biaryl moiety in the binding pocket. This difference disrupts key interactions between the ligand and the protein and highlights the importance of the linker in the design of tethered compounds. "
"The solution conformations of two potent bicyclic antagonists  [dPen1, cyclo(Glu4,Lys8)]OT were studied by a combined use of 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy in DMSO and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. NMR data have suggested a model for the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the bicyclic analogues of OT (OT-BC) with a \xce\xb2-turn at the Tyr2 and Ile3 residues, and with a cis amide bond between Cys6 and Pro7. A 3D structure containing a type III \xce\xb2-turn at Tyr2-Ile3 has been shown to be consistent with NMR data. This structure was proposed as a model of the solution conformation of OT-BC and extensively tested by MD simulations with the AMBER force field. MD simulations at 300 K with NMR derived distance and \xcf\x86 torsion angle constraints demonstrated the consistency of this model with NMR data, and its stability was further demonstrated by non-constrained MD simulations. Dynamic properties of the 3D structure were explored by high-temperature MD at 500 K. Conformational transitions induced by a constrained rotation around the S\xe2\x88\x92S bond revealed relatively low potential energy barriers (30 to 50 kJ/mol) between equilibrium left-handed and right-handed conformers of the disulfide bridge in OT-BC. A dynamic model of the solution structure of OT-BC with the relatively stable backbone conformation and a fast conformational equilibrium in the disulfide bridge and lactam bridge moieties was proposed as a result of the extensive MD simulations. The solution structure of OT-BC is consistent with structure\xe2\x88\x92activity relations of peptide and non-peptide antagonists of OT. In particular, a \xce\xb2-turn at Tyr2-Ile3 seems to be the common feature responsible for antagonist interaction with the uterine receptor of OT. On the other hand, the 3D structure of OT-BC differs considerably from the crystal and solution structures of OT analogues with agonist activity. Therefore, this study supports the hypothesis of different modes of receptor binding for agonists and antagonists of OT. The model of 3D structure of OT-BC proposed in this study may be used as a template for the rational design of peptide and non-peptide antagonists of oxytocin. "
"A combination of experiment and theory provides insight into the structure and rearrangements of various C3H2 isomers. Photolysis of [13C]diazopropynes 6a\xe2\x88\x92c under matrix isolation conditions affords C3H2 isomers containing a single 13C-label. With the aid of computed vibrational frequencies and intensities (CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ), the seven 13C-isotopomers of triplet propynylidene 1a,b, singlet propadienylidene 2a\xe2\x88\x92c, and singlet cyclopropenylidene 3a,b are readily distinguished by IR spectroscopy. Monitoring the distribution of the 13C-label during photolysis at either \xce\xbb = 313 \xc2\xb1 10 nm or \xce\xbb > 444 nm reveals the involvement of two photochemical automerization processes. At \xce\xbb = 313 \xc2\xb1 10 nm, triplet propynylidene and singlet cyclopropenylidene photoequilibrate. The interconversion does not occur by a simple ring closure/ring opening mechanism, as hydrogen migration accompanies the interconversion. At \xce\xbb > 444 nm, H2CC13C:\xe2\x80\x89 (2b) and H2C13CC:\xe2\x80\x89 (2c) rapidly equilibrate. Various lines of evidence suggest that the equilibration occurs through a cyclopropyne transition state. Computational results confirm that the planar isomer of singlet cyclopropyne (4a, C2v) is the transition state for the interconversion of 2b and 2c. Unexpectedly, the calculations predict that the isomer of this compound containing a tetrahedral carbon atom (4b, C2v) lies ca. 7 kcal/mol higher in energy than the planar form. "
"triplet-4-Methylene-2-pentene-1,5-diyl (T-4t) has been generated upon irradiation of 2-vinylmethylenecyclopropane (6) in a bromine-doped xenon matrix and characterized by means of IR spectroscopy for the first time. Conclusions for the thermal isomerization of 6 to 3-methylenecyclopentene (7) are discussed. All experimental results indicate that this isomerization probably proceeds via the diradical S-4 as an intermediate. "
"Physically branched and cross-linked polymeric structures were produced for the first time by rotaxane formation during reaction of a pendant group of a preformed macromolecule. The rotaxane structure is believed to form from a hydrogen-bonded bimolecular complex of 5-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-phenylene-1\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-phenylene-32-crown-10 (16) by esterification of the hydroxy group of one macrocycle through the cavity of the second in its reaction with poly(methacryloyl chloride) (12). For esters formed in model reactions of 12 with methanol and with 5-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-phenylene-16-crown-5 (14), which is too small to be threaded, the degrees of polymerization were identical; however, the polymer from reaction of 12 and 16 under the same conditions had a significantly higher degree of polymerization and polydispersity, i.e., was highly branched via rotaxane formation. Increasing the concentration in the reaction of 12 with 16 led to the formation of a gel fraction along with a high molecular weight sol fraction; the gel represents a novel network structure based on mechanical interlocking via rotaxane structures. 2D NOESY NMR experiments clearly demonstrated the rotaxane structure as manifest in the through-space correlation of the benzylic protons of the \xe2\x80\x9cthread\xe2\x80\x9d with the intra-annular protons of the \xe2\x80\x9cbead\xe2\x80\x9d.

"The kinetics of carbon monoxide binding and dissociation have been studied for a series of lacunar iron(II) cyclidene complexes to elucidate the dependence of dynamic parameters on the various structural features of these versatile compounds. Ligand substituents have large effects on the binding and dissociative rate constants, and remarkably, four distinctly different steric effects have been observed. (1) Changing cavity size alters the rate of CO binding by as much as 4 orders of magnitude, presumably by constraining access to the metal ion. (2) Decreases in cavity size also can increase the rate of CO dissociation by a factor of 10 or so. (3) Placing bulky groups in the path CO must follow to enter the cavity decreases the rate of binding because of steric effect (1), but these same obstructions may also decrease the rate of dissociation by blocking the escape path and, possibly, fostering geminate recombination. (4) Proximal ligand strain both decreases the rate of binding and increases the rate of CO dissociation. In contrast, changes in the iron(III)/(II) redox potential, which accompany ligand substitutions, were found to have only a small impact on CO binding kinetics. The effects on the rate constants of the basicity of the axial base and of solvent polarity were also investigated. "
"A model catalyst prepared from [Re2Pt(CO)12] supported on \xce\xb3-Al2O3 was characterized by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, and its stability in operation in a flow reactor was tested for the dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane at 1 atm and 400 \xc2\xb0C. EXAFS data characterizing the unused catalyst measured at both the Re LIII and Pt LIII edges at liquid nitrogen temperature with the sample in the presence of H2 distinguish the Re\xe2\x88\x92Pt from the Pt\xe2\x88\x92Pt and Re\xe2\x88\x92Re interactions. The EXAFS results form the basis of a simplified model of the supported bimetallic structures, consisting of Re4Pt2 entities, with oxophilic Re in a low positive oxidation state interacting strongly with the oxygen atoms of the \xce\xb3-Al2O3 support and stabilizing the dispersion of the Pt atoms. The catalyst made from [Re2Pt(CO)12] was found to be more resistant to deactivation during catalytic dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane than catalysts prepared conventionally from Re and Pt salt precursors. The catalyst prepared from [Re2Pt(CO)12] was more highly dispersed than the others, and its resistance to deactivation is attributed to the role of Re in stabilizing the dispersion of the Pt. "
"3\xe2\x80\x98,4\xe2\x80\x98-Dibutyl-5,5\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-diphenyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98:5\xe2\x80\x98,2\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-terthiophene (Bu2Ph2Tth) can be readily converted to the stable cation radical [Bu2Ph2Tth]+. The hexafluorophosphate salts of the cation radical ([Bu2Ph2Tth]PF6) are synthesized in millimolar quantities by either chemical or constant current electrochemical oxidation; the latter method gave X-ray quality single crystals. X-ray powder diffraction studies indicate the materials from both syntheses have the same structure. The crystal structure of [Bu2Ph2Tth]PF6 was determined and is temperature dependent. At 293 K, [Bu2Ph2Tth]PF6 crystallizes in the C2/c space group while at 106 K it belongs to the P21/n space group and exhibits a superlattice structure where the c axis is approximately double that at 293 K. Both structures consist of columnar \xe2\x80\x9cslipped \xcf\x80-stacks\xe2\x80\x9d of [Bu2Ph2Tth]+ cations and channels of PF6- anions. At 293 K, the cations stack with a regular interplanar contact distance of 3.47 \xc3\x85; at 106 K, the contact distances alternate regularly such that each cation has interplanar contact distances of 3.36(5) and 3.42(5) \xc3\x85 with the two neighboring cations in the \xcf\x80-stack. The crystal structure of Bu2Ph2Tth was also determined, and comparisons are made to the structure of [Bu2Ph2Tth]PF6. Several physical techniques (UV\xe2\x88\x92vis\xe2\x88\x92NIR\xe2\x88\x92IR absorption, spectroelectrochemistry, ESR, conductivity) were used to investigate the electronic structure of the cation radical in solution, embedded in a thin film polymer network and as a pure solid sample. The measured physical properties correlate with the crystal structures of [Bu2Ph2Tth]PF6 and indicate that the material has a band-like electronic structure characteristic of a semiconductor. "
"Second-order rate constants k12(obsd) measured at 25 \xc2\xb0C in acetonitrile by stopped-flow for 47 electron transfer (ET) reactions among ten tetraalkylhydrazines, four ferrocene derivatives, and three p-phenylenediamine derivatives are discussed. Marcus\'s adiabatic cross rate formula k12(calcd) = (k11 k22 k12 f12)1/2, ln f12 = (ln K12)2/4 ln(k11k22/Z2) works well to correlate these data. When all k12(obsd) values are simultaneously fitted to this relationship, best-fit self-exchange rate constants, kii(fit), are obtained that allow remarkably accurate calculation of k12(obsd); k12(obsd)/k12\xe2\x80\x98(calcd) is in the range of 0.55\xe2\x88\x921.94 for all 47 reactions. The average \xce\x94\xce\x94Gij\xe2\xa7\xa7 between observed activation free energy and that calculated using kii(fit) is 0.13 kcal/mol. Simulations using Jortner vibronic coupling theory to calculate k12 using parameters which produce the wide range of kii values observed predict that Marcus\'s formula should be followed even when V is as low as 0.1 kcal/mol, in the weakly nonadiabatic region. Tetracyclohexylhydrazine has a higher kii than tetraisopropylhydrazine by a factor of ca. 10. Replacing the dimethylamino groups of tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine by 9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonyl groups has little effect on kii, demonstrating that conformations which have high intermolecular aromatic ring overlap are not necessary for large ET rate constants. Replacing a \xce\xb3 CH2 group of a 9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonyl group by a carbonyl group lowers kii by a factor of 17 for the doubly substituted hydrazine and by considerably less for the doubly substituted p-phenylenediamine.

"Correlated ab initio calculations have been carried out with a parallel version of the PSGVB electronic structure code to obtain relative energetics of a number of conformations of the alanine tetrapeptide. The highest level of theory utilized, local MP2 with the cc-pVTZ(\xe2\x88\x92f) correlation-consistent basis set, has previously been shown to provide accurate conformational energies in comparison with experiment for a data set of small molecules. Comparisons with published and new canonical MP2 calculations on the alanine dipeptide are made. Results for ten gas-phase tetrapeptide conformations and a \xce\xb2-sheet dipeptide dimer are compared with 20 different molecular mechanics force field parametrizations, providing the first assessment of the reliability of these models for systems larger than a dipeptide. Comparisons are made with the LMP2/cc-pVTZ(\xe2\x88\x92f) results, which are taken as a benchmark for the tetrapeptides. Statistical summaries with regard to energetics and structure are produced for each force field, and a discussion of qualitative successes and failures is provided. The results display both the successes and limitations of the force fields studied and can be used as benchmark data in the development of new and improved force fields. In particular, comparisons of hydrogen-bonding energetics as a function of geometry suggest that future force fields will need to employ a representation for electrostatics that goes beyond the use of atom-centered partial charges.

"High levels of ab initio (MP2, CASSCF, CASPT2N) and density functional (Becke3LYP) theory have been used to assess the homoaromatic character of some strained semibullvalenes. Based on geometric, energetic, and magnetic criteria (magnetic susceptibility exaltations and the nucleus independent chemical shifts, NICS), Cs semibullvalene itself is not aromatic, but the C2v transition state for its Cope rearrangement is highly bishomoaromatic. Appropriate annelations destabilize the Cs geometries, and the bishomoaromatic structures are the only minima for several semibullvalenes:\xe2\x80\x89 1,5-methano; 2,8:4,6-bisethano and -bismethano; and 2,8-monoethano. In contrast, the 4,6-ethanosemibullvalene is predicted to be localized and not homoaromatic. Inclusion of dynamic electron correlation is very important for computing the geometries and relative energies of the delocalized structures. To aid experimental investigations, the UV and 13C NMR spectra of some of the semibullvalenes have been predicted. Long-wavelength UV absorptions and down-field 13C NMR chemical shifts for C2,8,4,6 are characteristic. "
"Ab Initio calculations have been performed in order to investigate why the introduction of each trigonal center into a cyclopropane ring results in an increase in strain energy of 12\xe2\x88\x9214 kcal/mol. Our calculations find that, as is commonly believed, introduction of a trigonal center into a three-membered ring does create some additional angle strain. However, our computational results show that the major source of the additional \xe2\x80\x9cstrain\xe2\x80\x9d that results from the introduction of each trigonal center into cyclopropane is not an increase in angle strain but the loss of a very strong cyclopropane C\xe2\x88\x92H bond.

"Model solvent effects, related to DNA stability in water, are explored with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) hydrophobicity and (ii) salt modulated electrostatic effects. The 2.6 \xc3\x85 resolution X-ray coordinates of the DNA oligomer from Zif268 are used to seed the MD simulations. The molecular model contains fully charged and geometrically unrestricted 10 base-pairs DNA in a 2640 water molecules bath with 18 Na-ions at 298 K. (i) The hydrophobicity correction affects the water\xe2\x88\x92oxygen repulsive (\xe2\x88\x9aC12(Ow,Ow)) parameter that transforms the \xe2\x80\x9chydrophilic\xe2\x80\x9d united carbon atom in the old GROMOS-87 force field into an hydrophobic one. The root mean square (rms) deviations stay below 2.8 \xc3\x85, and the 600 ps-averaged and regularized structure elicits the positive effect of this correction on the structure. (ii) The electrostatic effects are probed by constructing a distribution of counterions placed in between phosphate groups at the end of a collective equilibration; salt (co-ion) effects are modeled by imposing a weak harmonic constraint (0.58 kcal mol-1 \xc3\x85-2) to the equilibrated set of counterions. A 1 ns trajectory shows rms deviations from X-ray below 1.7 \xc3\x85 for all atoms at 600 ps and below 2.3 \xc3\x85 in the time span up to 1 ns; counterions fluctuations are large enough to allow for DNA bending and conformational changes. The quality of this simulation can be appreciated from diferent averaged and regularized structures. The structural results are comparable to those obtained with state-of-the-art force fields using Ewald summation technique for an oligonucleotide of similar size. "
"The hydride and methyl \xce\xb2-migratory insertion processes in CpM(PH3)(CH2CH2)R+ (M = Co, Rh, Ir; R = H, CH3) as well as the microscopically reverse \xce\xb2-elimination reactions have been studied by relativistic density functional theory. The calculations reveal that the \xce\xb2-migratory insertion reactions of the olefin hydride complexes CpM(PH3)(CH2CH2)H+ (M = Co, Rh, Ir) have electronic reaction barriers of 0.3 (Co), 2.7 (Rh), and 6.1 kcal/mol (Ir), respectively. Further, the \xce\xb2-migratory insertion reactions of hydride are exothermic for cobalt (\xce\x94He = \xe2\x88\x923.4 kcal/mol) and rhodium (\xce\x94He = \xe2\x88\x921.0 kcal/mol), but endothermic for iridium (\xce\x94He = 3.7 kcal/mol). Relativistic effects are important for the calculated trends within the cobalt triad. Without relativity the \xce\xb2-migratory insertion reactions would be exothermic for all three metals. For the corresponding \xce\xb2-migratory insertion reactions of methyl the barriers are 15.2 (Co), 19.8 (Rh), and 23.2 kcal/mol (Ir), respectively. The reactions are exothermic for all three metals with \xce\x94He = \xe2\x88\x9212.7 (Co), \xe2\x88\x928.5 (Rh), and \xe2\x88\x925.3 kcal/mol (Ir), respectively. Structures of reactants, transition states, and products were fully optimized. For the hydride migration, the transition states are close to the hydrido olefin systems CpM(PH3)(CH2CH2)H+ for M = Co and Rh, whereas the transition states for the iridium hydride resemble the ethyl compound CpIr(PH3)(CH2CH2H)+. The transition states for the methyl migration are product-like for all three metals. The most stable conformation of the ethyl and propyl product complexes CpM(PH3)(CH2CH2R)+ exhibits in all cases a \xce\xb2-agostic M\xe2\x88\x92H\xe2\x88\x92C interaction. The strength of this interaction decreases down the cobalt triad. An extensive thermochemical analysis is provided for the relative stability of CpM(PH3)(CH2CH2)R+ and CpM(PH3)(CH2CH2R)+ (M = Co, Rh, Ir; R = H, CH3). "
"Limiting ionic conductance (\xce\x9b0) of rigid symmetrical unipositive ions in aqueous solution shows a strong temperature dependence. For example, \xce\x9b0 more than doubles when the temperature is increased from 283 to 318 K. A marked variation also occurs when the solvent is changed from ordinary water (H2O) to heavy water (D2O). In addition, \xce\x9b0 shows a nonmonotonic size dependence with a skewed maximum near Cs+. Although these important results have been known for a long time, no satisfactory theoretical explanation exists for these results. In this article we present a simple molecular theory which provides a nearly quantitative explanation in terms of microscopic structure and dynamics of the solvent. A notable feature of this theory is that it does not invoke any nonquantifiable models involving solvent-berg or clatherates. We find the strong temperature dependence of \xce\x9b0 to arise from a rather large number of microscopic factors, each providing a small but nontrivial contribution, but all acting surprisingly in the same direction. This work, we believe, provides, for the first time, a satisfactory explanation of both the anomalous size and temperature dependencies of \xce\x9b0 of unipositive ions in molecular terms. The marked change in \xce\x9b0 as the solvent is changed from H2O to D2O is found to arise partly from a change in the dielectric relaxation and partly from a change in the effective interaction of the ion with the solvent.

"We report the antibody catalysis of an electrophilic tandem ring forming process that yields a bicyclic ring system at neutral pH. Three closely related decalin systems that represent rings A and B of the steroid nucleus account for 50% of the overall products. The linear diene substrate has been designed to mimic the first two isoprene units of 2,3-oxidosqualene, where the epoxide oxygen has been substituted by an arylsulfonate as leaving group. The hapten is based on a decahydroquinoline system with an N-oxide functionality as the key structure to elicit a combining site architecture capable of promoting leaving group release. The kcat for the formation of sulfonic acid in the catalyzed reaction was determined to be 0.021 min-1. The efficiency of the antibody-catalyzed process is underscored by the fact that the bicyclic products are not formed in the absence of the antibody catalyst under our mild conditions. "
"The antitumor antibiotics FR66979 (1), FR900482 (2), and FK973 (3) are similar in structure and biological activity to the DNA cross-linking antitumor antibiotic mitomycin C (4). The cytotoxic effects of 1\xe2\x88\x923 have been proposed to result from sequential bioreductive cleavage of the N\xe2\x88\x92O bond and condensation of the thus-exposed amine and ketone functions to yield an indole (e.g., 9) which is structurally analogous to the mitosene nucleus of reductively activated mitomycins. We report herein evidence substantiating this proposal based upon study of the reductive activation chemistry of 1 and 2 using thiols and iron(II) in the absence and presence of DNA. Prolonged exposure of reductively activated 1 to sodium borohydride afforded the dihydroindole 11, presumably through trapping of the iminium ion precursor (16). Kinetics measurements strongly implicate a relatively long-lived precursor to the iminium ion, which accumulates following iron(II)-catalyzed thiol-promoted reduction of 1, proposed herein to be one or both of the isomeric aminals 12. Under appropriate conditions, some step or steps between this intermediate and the iminium ion are shown to be rate limiting in DNA cross-linking, in production of the dihydroindole by borohydride trapping, and in the decay of the intermediate(s) competent to produce those same products. These studies clearly demonstrate the strong similarities in the cascade of reactions which follow reductive activation of FR66979 (1) [and presumably by extension FR900482 (2) and FK973 (3)] and the mitomycins.

"The backscattered vibrational Raman optical activity (ROA) spectra of three single-stranded polyribonucleotides, poly(rA), poly(rC), and poly(rU), together with two double-stranded polyribonucleotides, poly(rA)\xc2\xb7 poly(rU) and poly(rG)\xc2\xb7poly(rC), which both adopt A-type double helices, are reported in buffered H2O and D2O solutions between \xe2\x88\xbc650 and 1750 cm-1. The ROA spectra are subdivided into three distinct regions that contain information on different stereochemical elements of nucleic acid structure. Between \xe2\x88\xbc1550 and 1750 cm-1, ROA is generated through coupling of the vibrational coordinates on adjacent stacked bases that are chirally disposed. Large differences are observed between the spectra recorded in H2O and D2O in this region. Between \xe2\x88\xbc1200 and 1550 cm-1, vibrational coordinates in the sugar and base rings couple in the normal modes to produce ROA signals that reflect the mutual orientation of these two rings and also the conformation of the sugar ring itself. Between \xe2\x88\xbc950 and 1150 cm-1, a base-independent ROA triplet is observed that is characteristic of the particular sugar ring and sugar\xe2\x88\x92phosphate backbone conformation present in A-type helices. These first results indicate that ROA is a powerful new probe of nucleic acid solution stereochemistry. "
"Tethering the Hoechst 33258 fluorophore to the 5\xe2\x80\x98-terminus of the polypyrimidine third strand of parallel-stranded DNA triplexes results in complexes with increased Tm values that vary with both the pH of the solution and the sequence of the target DNA. These pH/sequence effects are likely related to the presence of M+-G-C base triplets, which can result in either charge\xe2\x88\x92charge effects involving the base triplet and the charged piperazine ring of the ligand or changes in the nature of the minor groove binding site resulting from the introduction of the N2-exocyclic amino group(s). As with DNA duplexes, sequence targets rich in A-T base pairs are most effective in taking advantage of such ligand-induced stability. A duplex sequence rich in A-T base pairs adjacent to the triple helix also appears to permit adjacent ligand binding; that is, the triplex is stabilized by the binding of the tethered minor groove ligand in an A-T rich duplex adjacent to the site of the triplex. The Hoechst ligand can be very effective in stabilizing G-T-A base triplets which are generally less effective in triplex formation, presumably as the result of a single interstrand G-T hydrogen bond. Stabilization may occur in part because the (AATT)2 minor groove may offer the ligand a preferred binding site as has been documented for this sequence in DNA duplexes. Binding to the triplex results in an enhanced quantum yield for the fluorophore, the magnitude of which is dependent upon sequence effects. Stopped flow experiments have provided some insight into the nature of the process; rapid ligand binding to the duplex target is followed by a slower process, one interpreted to reflect the third strand binding to generate the conjugated DNA triplex. Although not conclusive, the experiments suggest that the Hoechst conjugated polypyrimidine strands bind to the target duplex by two simultaneous sets of interactions:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) third strand binding in the major groove and (ii) tethered Hoechst 33258 ligand binding in the minor groove.

"Acylperrhenate reagents promote hydroxyl-directed syn-oxidative polycyclizations of primary and secondary hydroxypolyenes, forming bis- and tristetrahydrofuranyl alcohols with excellent trans-stereoselectivity for each tetrahydrofuran ring. The combination of dichloroacetylperrhenate/dichloroacetic anhydride affords stereoselective syn-oxidative bicyclization to bistetrahydrofuranyl alcohol products, whereas trifluoroacetylperrhenate/trifluoroacetic anhydride or trichloroacetylperrhenate/trichloroacetic anhydride are more suitable for stereoselective formation of tristetrahydrofuranyl alcohols from acyclic hydroxytrienes. In the tricyclization reaction chirality induction from a single stereogenic hydroxyl group affords diastereoselective formation of six additional stereocenters in a single step. However, we have found that the growing polytetrahydrofuran chain can exert chelation effects upon the alkoxyrhenium intermediate, thus diminishing the degree of product diastereoselectivity. These syn-oxidative cyclization synthesis strategies mimic a possible pathway for the biosynthesis of many polycyclic ether natural products, including the tristetrahydrofuran acetogenin goniocin (1).

"We have developed a new route to silicon-centered phthalocyanines and phthalocyanine-like compounds that is robust and flexible, and of considerable potential usefulness. This route entails insertion of silicon into the metal-free macrocycle. It has been developed in the course of preparing four new and two known metal-free, six new dihydroxysilicon, and six new bis-trihexylsiloxysilicon octabutoxy- and octabutoxybenzophthalocyanines. One of the siloxysilicon compounds, that with the ligand 5,9,12,16,19,23,28,32-octabutoxy-33H,35H-dibenzo[b,g]dinaphtho[2,3-l:2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-q]porphyrazine, has a Q-band at a wavelength of 804 nm and an extinction coefficient of 1.9 \xc3\x97 105 M-1 cm-1. Its wavelength thus matches the wavelength of the output of the most common GaAlAs diode laser. The compound and its analog in which the benzo rings are trans to each other instead of cis have no tendency to aggregate in benzene up to a concentration of 150 \xce\xbcM. The triplet state of the cis isomer has an absorption maximum at 640 nm and a lifetime in deaerated benzene solution of 105 \xce\xbcs, while the triplet state of the trans isomer has a maximum at 660 nm and a lifetime of 72 \xce\xbcs. Both isomers have a triplet quantum yield, Qt, of ca. 0.20 and a singlet oxygen quantum yield, Q\xce\x94, of ca. 0.20, photochemical properties that are consistent with potentially efficient photosensitization action in photodynamic therapy of tumors. For both sensitizers, energy transfer from the sensitizer triplet to ground state of dioxygen is reversible at appropriate concentrations. For the cis isomer, the equilibrium constant for the energy transfer process, Ke, is 0.012 \xc2\xb1 0.001, and the triplet state energy calculated from this, ET, is 21.29 kcal/mol (ET derived from phosphorescence measurements is 21.26 kcal/mol). For the trans isomer, Ke is 3.68 \xc3\x97 10-3 and ET is 19.27 kcal/mol. "
"A new approach to the asymmetric synthesis of (E)-olefin dipeptide isosteres is described based on asymmetric C\xe2\x88\x92N bond constructions resulting from nitronium tetrafluoroborate (NO2BF4) promoted electrophilic nitrations of chiral (E)-crotylsilanes and from a copper(I)-catalyzed enantioselective aziridination of chiral (E)-crotylsilanes. The silane reagents undergo efficient anti-SE\xe2\x80\x98 additions to the nitrogen-based electrophiles to give the (E)-olefin isosteres in >96% de. The topological bias is principally controlled by the facial bias of the silane reagent. The scope of the methodology was explored via several related crotylsilane derivatives. The (E)-olefin isosteres are nonhydrolyzable, rigid analogs of the peptide linkage in biologically active peptides. The new methodology will facilitate the preparation and study of peptidomimetics since the crotylsilane reagents allow for incorporation of a wide range of functionality on the resulting isosteres.

"This report describes a highly catalytic bimetallic system for the low temperature selective oxidation of methane, ethane, and butane with dioxygen as the oxidant. The catalytic system consists of a mixture of copper chloride and metallic palladium and operates in a 3:1 mixture (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid and water in the presence of dioxygen and carbon monoxide. Methane was selectively converted to methanol. The dependence of the reaction rate on the partial pressure of methane was measured, and saturation kinetics was observed. The dependence of the rate on the partial pressure of carbon monoxide was measured at two different pressures of methane, and a first-order dependence on the partial pressure of carbon monoxide was observed in both instances. The activation parameters for the overall reaction were obtained under the reaction conditions when the rate was first order in both methane and carbon monoxide. The values obtained were A = 2 \xc3\x97 104 s-1 and Ea = 15.3 kcal mol-1. Both C\xe2\x88\x92H and C\xe2\x88\x92C cleavage products were observed for ethane and n-butane, resulting in the formation of methanol, ethanol, and acetic acid. The rate of formation of methanol from methane with the bimetallic system was ca. 65 \xc3\x97 10-4 M/min at 145\xe2\x88\x92150 \xc2\xb0C. This rate may be compared to the rate of formation of acetic acid from methanol in the benchmark Monsanto process:\xe2\x80\x89 380 \xc3\x97 10-4 M/min at 180 \xc2\xb0C. "
"Aryl chlorides are converted to aniline derivatives using catalytic amounts of Ni(COD)2 (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) and DPPF (DPPF = 1,1\xe2\x80\x98-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) or 1,10-phenanthroline in the presence of sodium tert-butoxide. This procedure has a broad substrate scope:\xe2\x80\x89 electron-rich or electron-poor aryl chlorides, as well as chloropyridine derivatives, can be combined with primary and secondary amines to give the desired aryl amine products in moderate to excellent yields. Additionally, a procedure which utilizes the air-stable precatalysts (DPPF)NiCl2 or (1,10-phenanthroline)NiCl2 is also described. "
"Thermolysis of azoperester 5 affords \xce\xb3-azo radical 14, which cyclizes to hydrazyl radical 15 at a rate of 1.3 \xc3\x97 109 M-1 s-1 at 110 \xc2\xb0C. Our experimental results are consistent with loss of a methyl radical from 15 to afford 2-pyrazoline 9, which is oxidized in situ by the starting 5 to pyrazole 6. This unusual and endothermic \xce\xb2-scission can be rationalized if the odd electron in 15 is better aligned with the CH3\xe2\x88\x92C bond than with the weaker t-Bu\xe2\x88\x92N bond. The fact that 5-endo cyclization of 14 is 5 \xc3\x97 107 faster than that of the analogous olefinic radical 30 led us to carry out ab initio calculations on simplified structures. \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 for methyl radical addition to diimide is only 0.84 kcal/mol lower than for addition to ethylene and the exothermicity is only 3.5 kcal/mol greater. However, the smaller CNN than CCC bond angle leads to a \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 13.3 kcal/mol lower for 5-endo cyclization of 4,5-diazapenten-1-yl than for the analogous 4-pentenyl radical. Photolysis of 5 selectively cleaves the azo group, producing \xce\xb3-perester radical 20. This species undergoes intramolecular attack on the peroxide linkage to form lactone 23 at a rate of 1.5 \xc3\x97 104 s-1 at 22 \xc2\xb0C. The cyclization rate of 20 is slow enough that 5 could be used as a photochemical bifunctional initiator, but cyclization of 14 to the azo group is so rapid that this radical would only rarely attack a monomer.

"Diarylethene derivatives, which have an optically active l- or d-menthyl group at the 2-position of benzo[b]thiophene ring, were synthesized. Irradiation with 450 nm light in solution led to the formation of diastereomer pairs of the closed-ring forms. The product ratio of the diastereomers was dependent on solvent polarity and temperature. In slightly polar (or polarizable) solvents, such as THF and toluene, an asymmetric photocyclization was observed. At \xe2\x88\x9240 \xc2\xb0C in toluene, a diastereomer excess as large as 86.6% was observed. The mechanism of the asymmetric photocyclization is discussed. "
"An enantioselective synthetic route to (+)-dynemicin A (1) is described that involves as the key and final step the Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder cycloaddition of the quinone imine 6 with the isobenzofuran 107 followed by an oxidative workup to provide (+)-1 in 40% yield. The synthetic route begins with the condensation of (\xe2\x88\x92)-menthyl acetoacetate and trans-ethyl crotonate to form the crystalline cyclohexanedione 14, which is then transformed to the enantiomerically pure quinone imine 6 in 23 steps with an average yield of 85% and an overall yield of 2\xe2\x88\x923%. Key features of this sequence include the coupling of the enol triflate 11 and the arylboronic acid 10 (90%), the thermal deprotection/internal amidation of the coupling product 18 (84%), the use of 2-chloropyridine as an economical alternative to 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine to promote the reaction of the quinolone 9 and triflic anhydride (85%), the highly stereoselective addition of the (Z)-enediyne 31 to the quinoline 61 (89%), intramolecular acetylide addition within the acetylenic ketone 66 (94%), and oxidation of the phenol 76 with iodosobenzene to afford the quinone imine precursor 77 in 89% yield. Both the quinone imine and isobenzofuran components of the final coupling reaction can be varied, thus providing an ideal route for the preparation of a wide variety of dynemicin analogs. "
"The reactivity toward dioxygen of two series of dicobalt cofacial diporphyrins in solution in an aprotic solvent is described. Some of these compounds are efficient electrocatalysts for the four-electron reduction of dioxygen when adsorbed on a graphite electrode immersed in aqueous acid. Their electrochemical and spectroscopic (UV\xe2\x88\x92vis, EPR) behavior in solution shows that, contrary to what is observed with cobalt monomers, the neutral [PCoII\xe2\x80\x89CoIIP] (1) (P stands for a porphyrin ring) form does not react with dioxygen. Uniquely the one- and two-electron-oxidized forms of the dimer, [PCoII\xc2\xb7CoIIP]+ (1+) and [PCoII---CoIIP]2+ (12+), respectively, reversibly bind dioxygen, giving two complexes, 2 and 3, at room temperature and in the absence of a good axial ligand. The stability constants of the two O2 complexes have been measured spectrophotometrically and/or electrochemically, and prove to be remarkably high. As a whole, the present O2 binding processes appear unprecedented as basically different in many respects from the process classically described in the case of cobalt monomers. Extended H\xc3\xbcckel molecular orbital (EHMO) calculations, based on the crystal structure of the Co2FTF4 dimer in its uncomplexed form (Co\xe2\x88\x92Co distance 3.42 \xc3\x85), show that, in the absence of very important deformations of its structure, the only possible geometry for the O2 complex of the two-electron-oxidized derivative [PCo\xe2\x88\x92O2\xe2\x88\x92CoP]2+ (3) is the \xce\xbc-\xce\xb72:\xce\xb72-peroxo structure. The calculated corresponding electronic diagram affords a rationale for most of the experimentally observed properties. Specifically, the O2 complex of the one-electron-oxidized form [PCo\xe2\x88\x92O2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x88\x92CoP]+ (2), the reduced form of complex 3, should be considered as a species in which the O2 moiety is further reduced, at least partially, as compared to its peroxo state in 3, i.e., consequently in an oxidation state intermediate between peroxo (\xe2\x88\x921) and oxo (\xe2\x88\x922). Preliminary results indicate that this species reacts with one proton, while the two-electron-oxidized O2 complex 3 is resistant to protonation. The possible implications of these specific properties of the dicobalt dimers in the four-electron reduction mechanism of O2 are discussed, and structural and mechanistic similarities with bioinorganic dinuclear sites appear significant.

"Synthesis of stable hydride isocyanide derivatives Nb(\xce\xb75-C5H4SiMe3)2(H)(CNR) has been achieved through the formation of coordinatively unsaturated 16-electron species Nb(\xce\xb75-C5H4SiMe3)2H by thermolytic loss of H2 followed by the coordination of an isocyanide ligand. Low-temperature protonation with a slight excess of CF3COOH leads to the \xce\xb72-dihydrogen complexes [Nb(\xce\xb75-C5H4SiMe3)2(\xce\xb72-H2)(CNR)]+. NMR spectra of these H\xe2\x88\x92H complexes and their monodeuterated H\xe2\x88\x92D isotopomers present a single high-field resonance at room temperature. By lowering the temperature to 178 K, decoalescence of the signal was observed for the H\xe2\x88\x92D complexes but not for the H\xe2\x88\x92H ones. By combining DFT electronic structure calculations with a monodimensional rotational tunneling model, it has been shown that the absence of decoalescence of the H\xe2\x88\x92H signal is due to the existence of a very large exchange coupling. Conversely, for the H\xe2\x88\x92D isotopomer, the difference in zero point energy corresponding to two nonequivalent (H\xe2\x88\x92D and D-H) positions leads to a slight asymmetry which dramatically reduces the exchange coupling, allowing decoalescence to be observed. Therefore, the H\xe2\x88\x92D classical rotation and the quantum exchange processes will not be practically observed for this complex, whereas only the classical process for the H\xe2\x88\x92H species is quenched out on the NMR time scale.

"Solutions of Rh(PR3)2(CO)Cl (R = Me, Ph) are found to catalyze the rapid transfer of oxygen from amine oxides or organoselenium oxides to carbon monoxide; however, the rhodium complexes undergo no reaction with the oxides in the absence of added CO. Kinetic studies indicate that the catalytically active species is the CO-substituted complex Rh(PR3)(CO)2Cl, although it is not present in any observable concentration under the conditions of the reaction. Ir(PPh3)2(CO)2Cl also acts as an efficient catalyst precursor for the same oxygen transfer reactions, although like the rhodium complex it undergoes little or no direct reaction with the oxides. The catalytically active species is again found to be the product of substitution of a ligand (in this case, chloride) by CO:\xe2\x80\x89 [Ir(PPh3)2(CO)3]+ in either ion-paired or unpaired states. Among substrates with weak E\xe2\x88\x92O bonds (E = N, Se), reactivity correlates with substrate basicity in accord with a transition state having the character of a nucleophilic attack (at carbonyl carbon). Oxides with much stronger E\xe2\x88\x92O bonds, even the highly basic triphenylarsine oxide, are much less reactive; the transition state in this case apparently involves significant E\xe2\x88\x92O bond breaking and is presumably not well modeled as a simple nucleophilic attack. Pt(Ph3As)(CO)Cl2 was found to act as a good catalyst precursor for deoxygenation of arsine oxide, but this system is apparently very complex and the nature of the catalytically active species has not been elucidated.

"Cytochrome oxidase is the terminal oxidase in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and is responsible for the generation of cellular energy via the process known as oxidative phosphorylation. The enzyme contains two Fe and three Cu centers which together provide the redox machinery for the reduction of O2 to water. Recently, X-ray crystallography has provided the first three-dimensional description of the coordination spheres of the metal centers. However, the structures show the metal sites at low resolution, and in order to fully understand the mechanism of the reaction, it is desirable to determine the metrical details (bond lengths and angles) to much higher precision. X-ray absorption spectroscopy is unique in its ability to provide such detail, and we have applied the technique to determining the structure of the CuA center, a thiolate-bridged binuclear copper cluster in which the coppers are bridged by two cysteine ligands and have an extremely short Cu\xe2\x88\x92Cu distance of \xe2\x88\xbc2.4 \xc3\x85. X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which had previously predicted the short Cu\xe2\x88\x92Cu distance, has been used to further refine the structural details of the site in both the mixed-valence and fully reduced forms of the enzymes from Thermus thermophilus and Bacillus subtilis. The results have defined the structure of the CuA core as a Cu2S2 diamond with Cu\xe2\x88\x92S bond lengths of 2.3 \xc3\x85, Cu\xe2\x88\x92Cu = 2.44 \xc3\x85, and very acute Cu\xe2\x88\x92S\xe2\x88\x92Cu angles of 65\xc2\xb0. One-electron reduction produces only minor changes in the core geometry, with the Cu\xe2\x88\x92S and Cu\xe2\x88\x92Cu bond lengths increasing to 2.33 and 2.51 \xc3\x85, respectively, but with the Cu\xe2\x88\x92S\xe2\x88\x92Cu angle remaining unchanged at 65\xc2\xb0. The unusually high Cu\xe2\x88\x92S Debye\xe2\x88\x92Waller terms imply that there is significant asymmetry in the Cu2S2 diamond core derived from inequivalent Cu\xe2\x88\x92S bond lengths. Both the metrical parameters and the temperature dependence of the Debye\xe2\x88\x92Waller factors exhibit subtle differences between the mixed-valence and fully reduced proteins which suggest that the short distance may be the result, in part, of a weak metal\xe2\x88\x92metal bond. The results suggest that the function of the unusual CuA cluster is to provide a site with minimal structural perturbation occurring during electron transfer. Thus, they provide an excellent rationalization for the very low reorganizational energy, \xce\xbb, observed for the CuA center. "
The molecular structure and orientation of interfacial water molecules at the air/water interface in the presence of soluble cationic and anionic surfactants has been characterized. We have employed vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) to probe the orientation of interfacial water molecules as a function of both bulk surfactant concentration and solution ion strength. The observed ordering of interfacial water molecules is manifested by an enhancement of the OH stretching modes in the VSFG spectra. We attribute the observed enhancement to an alignment of the interfacial water molecules induced by the large electrostatic field present at these charged interfaces. The nature of this enhancement is further explored by studying mixed (cationic and anionic) surfactant systems as well as surfactant systems at different ionic strengths. From these studies we find that the interfacial water molecules attain their highest degree of alignment at surface surfactant concentrations well below maximum surface coverage. 
"The rapidly expanding field of combinatorial chemistry has stimulated the development of new methods and synthetic strategies for assembly of compound libraries. We propose four criteria that are desirable for synthetic routes to such libraries:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) the sequence involves a small number of steps; (2) no more than one variable is introduced in any step; (3) starting materials are readily obtained with a diverse selection of substituents, and (4) cyclic, nonoligomeric structures represent the most interesting targets. Guided by these criteria, we have explored an intramolecular version of the azomethine ylide cycloaddition reaction which utilizes readily available amino acids, aldehydes, and 2\xc2\xb0 amines as inputs. We prepared a number of cycloadducts in solution to optimize conditions and examine the scope of the process and to identify a synthetic strategy that would be amenable to solid-phase synthesis of these compounds. Transfer of the sequence to solid phase was demonstrated by the synthesis of a number of representative compounds, indicating that the chemistry is suitable for construction of a combinatorial library.

"The complete active space (CAS) SCF method and multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) have been used to study the electronic spectra of the nucleic acid base monomers guanine and two tautomers of adenine (the N(9)H and N(7)H forms). The calculations include vertical excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and transition moment directions in gas phase. For guanine solvent effects were included using a self-consistent reaction field model. The lowest \xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* excited valence states of N(9)H-adenine are calculated at (experimental data in parentheses) 5.1, 5.2 (4.9), 6.2 (5.7\xe2\x88\x926.1), 6.7, 7.0 (6.8), and 7.6 (7.7) eV. The first two almost degenerate states are characterized by small and medium intensities, respectively. The third and fifth transitions have large oscillator strengths. Two less clear assignments can be performed to the transitions observed in experiment at 4.6 and 6.3\xe2\x88\x926.4 eV. Presently they can be assigned to the 21A\xe2\x80\x98 and 51A\xe2\x80\x98 states of the N(9)H tautomer of adenine, but possible contributions to the 31A\xe2\x80\x98 and 61A\xe2\x80\x98 states of the N(7)H tautomer of adenine cannot be ruled out. As both tautomers appear to be present in experiment, the measured and calculated polarization angles differ substantially. For guanine the following energies are obtained for the lowest \xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* valence excited states:\xe2\x80\x89 4.7 (4.5\xe2\x88\x924.8), 5.1 (4.9\xe2\x88\x925.0), 6.0 (5.5\xe2\x88\x925.8), 6.5 (6.0\xe2\x88\x926.4), 6.6, 6.7 (6.6\xe2\x88\x926.7), and 6.7 eV. The polarization vectors of the first two transitions are almost perpendicular and point along the short and long axes, respectively. The fourth and sixth transitions are the most intense peaks of the spectrum. The experimental transition moment directions are reproduced with an accuracy better than 6\xc2\xb0. The fourth transition is strongly shifted to lower energies in polar solvents. "
"The role of the bulky ligands in Ni(II) diimine catalyzed ethylene polymerization has been examined with a combined density functional theory quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) model. Specifically, we have examined the catalytic center of the type (ArNC(R)\xe2\x88\x92C(R)NAr)NiII-R\xe2\x80\x98+, where R = Me and Ar = 2,6-C6H3(i-Pr)2. The Ar and R groups were treated by a molecular mechanics force field while density functional theory was applied to the remainder of the system. The chain propagation, chain branching, and chain termination processes have been investigated with the hybrid method and found to have barriers of \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 11.8, 15.3, and 18.4 kcal/mol, respectively, which is in excellent agreement with experiment in both absolute and relative terms. This is in stark contrast to the pure QM model in which the influence of the bulky Ar and R groups was neglected and the established order of the barriers is not even reproduced. The role played by the bulky substituents is dual in nature. First, the Ar and R groups act to sterically hinder the axial coordination sites of the Ni center. This has the most dramatic destabilizing effect on the resting state and termination transition states, in which both axial positions are occupied. In addition to the steric factor, we find that the electronic preference for the aryl rings to orient themselves in a coplanar fashion with the diimine ring results in a stabilization of the insertion transition state relative to the resting state. These two factors act to both lower the propagation barrier and increase the termination barrier compared to the \xe2\x80\x9cnaked\xe2\x80\x9d pure QM model system. "
"Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) with conjugated reactive groups are potential sequence-specific gene inactivating agents. The antitumor antibiotic CC-1065 binds preferably in the minor groove of A-T-rich sites of double-stranded DNA, and the cyclopropapyrroloindole (CPI) subunit of the drug alkylates adenines at their N3 position. Pure enantiomeric (+)- and (\xe2\x88\x92)-CPI and its N5-methyl homologue (MCPI) were synthesized and conjugated to an ODN. These conjugates were evaluated for their ability to alkylate a target containing a duplex region immediately adjacent to a single-stranded complementary binding region for the ODN conjugate. The conjugates demonstrated excellent stability in physiologic conditions and stereospecific, hybridization-triggered alkylation of the synthetic ODN targets. The dependence of the reaction rates on sequence of the duplex target region was in accord with the predicted minor groove binding of the conjugated CPI. The reactivity was highly dependent on the structure of the cross-linking group. Natural (+)-enantiomers alkylate 10\xe2\x88\x9220 times faster than the corresponding (\xe2\x88\x92)-enantiomers. Regiospecificity of the alkylation reaction is conferred by the length of the spacer arm. N5-Methylation of the CPI moiety suppresses the reactivity by a factor of 3\xe2\x88\x925. Addition of a 1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo[3,2-e]indole-7-carboxylate (DPI) binding subunit of CC-1065 between CPI or MCPI residues and an ODN results in a significant enhancement of the reactivity which is especially pronounced for (\xe2\x88\x92)-enantiomers. The main products of sequence-specific alkylation were determined for complexes with the most efficient reactions. "
"Total syntheses of (\xc2\xb1)-21-oxogelsemine (3) and (\xc2\xb1)-gelsemine (1) are described. Free radical cyclizations play important roles in constructing the tricyclic core (40 \xe2\x86\x92 41) and oxindole (93 \xe2\x86\x92 96) substructures of the target alkaloids, and an isomerization\xe2\x88\x92cyclization strategy (101 \xe2\x86\x92 102) was used to complete construction of the gelsemine cage. Observations made along the way include intramolecular 1,4- and 1,6-hydrogen atom transfers (64 \xe2\x86\x92 65 and 40 \xe2\x86\x92 47) and a free radical cyclization-fragmentation sequence (85 \xe2\x86\x92 86 + 87). A retroaldol\xe2\x88\x92aldol strategy for adjusting oxindole stereochemistry in gelsemine-like structures is also described (72 \xe2\x86\x92 74 and 86 \xe2\x86\x92 87). "
"The frequent occurrence of the cuboidal cluster [Fe3S4(S\xc2\xb7Cys)3] in a variety of proteins has prompted extensive investigation of its chemical and biological properties. The biological function remains in question, but the cluster is known to sustain two reactions:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) electron transfer, and (ii) heterometal ion incorporation. The recent preparation of [Fe3S4(LS3)]3- (3) [Zhou, J.; Hu, Z.; M\xc3\xbcnck, E.; Holm, R. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 1966] has permitted detailed structural, electronic, and reactivity characterization of the cuboidal [Fe3S4]0 oxidation state (LS3 = 1,3,5-tris((4,6-dimethyl-3-mercaptophenyl)thio)-2,4,6-tris(p-tolylthio)benzene(3\xe2\x88\x92). Redox properties (i) have been reported previously:\xe2\x80\x89 here reaction type (ii), resulting in the formation of cubane-type MFe3S4 clusters, has been investigated. Reaction of 3 with [M(PPh3)4]1+ affords [(Ph3P)MFe3S4(LS3)]2- (M = Cu (6), Ag (8)) while [(NC)M(PPh3)3] leads to [(NC)MFe3S4(LS3)]3- (M = Cu (7), Ag (9)). Treatment of 3 with Tl(O3SCF3) yields [TlFe3S4(LS3)]2- (10). The fragment formalism {M1+ + [Fe3S4]0} applies to 6\xe2\x88\x9210, which retain the S = 2 ground state of 3. Reaction of 3 with [M(PPh3)3Cl] yields [(Ph3P)MFe3S4(LS3)]2- (M = Co (12), Ni (14)) in inner-sphere redox reactions. Clusters 12 (S = 1) and 14 (S = 3/2) are formulated as {M2+ + [Fe3S4]1-}; antiferromagnetic coupling of fragment spins gives rise to the indicated spin ground states. The reactions (ii) are metal-ion incorporation processes, a new reaction type in Fe\xe2\x88\x92S chemistry. Previously, all cubane-type MFe3S4 clusters had been synthesized by spontaneous self-assembly or reductive rearrangement reactions. Cluster 7 exhibits reversible oxidation and reduction reactions; it is the only cluster that forms a stable oxidized product containing the [Fe3S4]1+ fragment. All other clusters show a reversible reduction and an irreversible or quasireversible oxidation. Potentials of the synthetic clusters are considered intrinsic to the various core units, being less influenced by environmental factors than are those in proteins. At parity of cluster charge and terminal ligation, the potential order is M = Fe < Co < Ni and Co < Ni < Cu < Ag < Tl for the [MFe3S4]2+,1+ and [MFe3S4]1+,0 core redox reactions. These orders are compared with those determined in proteins. "
"The hexacyanotitanate salt, [Et4N]3[Ti(CN)6]\xc2\xb74MeCN, has been prepared by addition of tetraethylammonium cyanide to the titanium(III) triflate salt Ti(O3SCF3)3(MeCN)3. The orange crystalline product has been characterized by X-ray diffraction, and the d1 anion is only slightly distorted from ideal Oh symmetry. The anion resides on a center of symmetry and is characterized by the following parameters:\xe2\x80\x89 Ti\xe2\x88\x92C = 2.195(2), 2.197(3), and 2.213(3) \xc3\x85; C\xe2\x88\x92N (av) = 1.141(4) \xc3\x85; C\xe2\x88\x92Ti\xe2\x88\x92C (cis) = 88.01(9), 88.02(9), 89.02(9), and 89.78(9)\xc2\xb0; C\xe2\x88\x92Ti\xe2\x88\x92C (trans) = 180\xc2\xb0. In addition to the crystallographic study, details of the IR (\xce\xbdCN = 2071 cm-1), EPR, and UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectra (\xce\x94o = 22800 cm-1) are given. Crystal data for [Et4N]3[Ti(CN)6]\xc2\xb74MeCN are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 monoclinic, space group I2/a, a = 18.171(6) \xc3\x85, b = 12.200(4) \xc3\x85, c = 20.989(5) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 91.17(2)\xc2\xb0, V = 4652(2) \xc3\x853, Z = 4, wR2 = 0.2054 for 3831 data, 27 restraints, and 318 parameters.

"Conformational dynamics have been studied in proteins, but the extent of thermal motion within large compact RNA molecules, including ribozymes, has not been systematically explored. Methods are developed for the incorporation of the alkyl-phenyl disulfide 1 and the alkyl thiol 2 at specific ribose 2\xe2\x80\x98-positions within RNA. These groups react under mild conditions to form disulfide cross-links by thiol\xe2\x88\x92disulfide interchange. When incorporated on opposite faces of a short, continuous RNA helix, these reactants do not form a disulfide cross-link. In contrast, in an active 310-nucleotide group I ribozyme prepared by semisynthetic methods, sites separated by a distance of up to 50 \xc3\x85 in the structure are cross-linked at rates only 3- to 15-times slower than cross-linking between proximal sites. Furthermore, ribozymes with normally distant sites held together by a disulfide cross-link retain substantial catalytic activity. These results reveal unexpectedly large thermal motions between domains of a compact folded ribozyme. "
"The first detection and characterization of oxomanganese(V) porphyrin complexes under ambient catalytic conditions is described. The reaction of (tetra-(N-methylpyridyl)porphyrinato)manganese(III) [Mn(III)TMPyP] with a variety of oxidants such as m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA), HSO5-, and ClO- has been shown to produce the same, short-lived intermediate (1) by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The Soret maximum of 1 was found at 443 nm, intermediate between that of oxomanganese(IV) (428 nm) and Mn(III)TMPyP (462 nm), thus facilitating its detection. The rate of formation of 1 from Mn(III)TMPyP followed second-order kinetics, first order in Mn(III) porphyrin and first order in oxidant. The rate constants have the following order:\xe2\x80\x89 m-CPBA (2.7 \xc3\x97 107 M-1 s-1) > HSO5- (6.9 \xc3\x97 105 M-1 s-1) \xe2\x89\x88 ClO- (6.3 \xc3\x97 105 M-1 s-1). Once formed, the intermediate species 1 was rapidly converted to oxoMn(IV) (2) by one-electron reduction with a first-order rate constant of 5.7 s-1. The oxoMn(IV) species 2 was relatively stable under the reaction conditions, decaying slowly to Mn(III)TMPyP with a first-order rate constant of 0.027 s-1. The identity of 1 as an oxomanganese(V) complex was indicated by its reactivity. The one-electron reduction of 1 to oxoMn(IV) was greatly accelerated by nitrite ion (k = 1.5 \xc3\x97 107 M-1 s-1). However, the reaction between nitrite and oxoMn(IV) is much slower (k = 1.4 \xc3\x97 102 M-1 s-1). The oxoMn(V) intermediate 1 was shown to be highly reactive toward olefins, affording epoxide products. By contrast, oxoMn(IV) (2) was not capable of effecting the same reaction under these conditions. In the presence of carbamazepine (3) efficient oxygen transfer from the highly reactive oxoMn(V) (1) to the olefin (second-order rate constant of 6.5 \xc3\x97 105 M-1 s-1) resulted in the conversion of 1 directly back to Mn(III)TMPyP without the appearance of the stable oxoMn(IV) intermediate 2. With m-CPBA as the oxidant in the presence of H218O, the product epoxide was shown to contain 35% 18O, consistent with an O-exchange-labile oxoMn(V) intermediate. Nitrite ion inhibited the epoxidation reaction competitively by one electron reduction of the oxoMn(V) intermediate to the unreactive oxoMn(IV). "
"The reaction of the iron(II) picket fence porphyrin derivative [Fe(TpivPP)(NO2)]- (Nasri et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 717) with NO has been examined. The result is a new hexacoordinated iron(II) porphyrin complex, [Fe(TpivPP)(NO2)(NO)]-. This compound has been characterized by UV\xe2\x88\x92vis, IR, EPR, and M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectroscopies. All data show that the species is low spin (S = 1/2). The EPR spectrum of [Fe(TpivPP)(NO2)(NO)]- (frozen chlorobenzene solution) is similar to that of five-coordinate nitrosyl derivatives of iron(II) porphyrinates with gx = 2.085, gy = 2.032, gz = 2.01, ax (14N) = 24 G, ay = 16.5 G, and az = 16 G. Two crystalline forms of [Fe(TpivPP)(NO2)(NO)]- were obtained and their molecular structures determined. In both crystalline forms, the axial nitro ligand is inside the \xe2\x80\x9cpocket\xe2\x80\x9d of the picket fence porphyrin derivative. In the first crystalline form isolated, there are two independent molecules, one of which has disorder in the nitro and nitrosyl groups while the other molecule has completely ordered axial ligands. In this first form, the plane of the nitro group is nearly perpendicular to the plane containing the nitrosyl group and the iron. In the second crystalline form, however, the two axial ligand planes are nearly parallel. M\xc3\xb6ssbauer investigations (solid state) show that the iron centers in the two different crystalline forms have different electronic properties. The M\xc3\xb6ssbauer parameters for the perpendicular form are \xce\xb4 = 0.22 mm/s and \xce\x94Eq = 1.78 mm/s (200 K) and for the parallel form \xce\xb4 = 0.35 mm/s and \xce\x94Eq = 1.2 mm/s (4.2 K). M\xc3\xb6ssbauer data are also presented for a related complex:\xe2\x80\x89 five-coordinate [Fe(TPP)(NO)] (TPP = meso-tetraphenylporphinato). IR spectra for the two forms also reveal distinctly different interactions of the trans (nitro) ligand. "
"The synthesis and characterization of a series of bis(cyanide)(meso-tetraalkylporphyrinatoiron(III)), [Fe(TRP)(CN)2]- where R is H, Me, Et, and iPr, are reported. The 1H NMR spectrum of the unsubstituted [Fe(THP)(CN)2]- shows a pyrrole signal at \xce\xb4 = \xe2\x88\x9223.19 ppm (\xe2\x88\x9225 \xc2\xb0C) in CD2Cl2, which is quite typical as a low spin ferric complex. As the bulkiness of the meso substituent increases, the pyrrole signal moves to lower magnetic field; 0.34, \xe2\x88\x922.26, and 11.94 ppm for [Fe(TMeP)(CN)2]-, [Fe(TEtP)(CN)2]-, and [Fe(TiPrP)(CN)2]-, respectively. Corresponding to the pyrrole proton signal, the cyanide carbon signal also exhibits a large downfield shift. The difference in chemical shifts between [Fe(THP)(CN)2]- and [Fe(TiPrP)(CN)2]- reaches as much as 1443 ppm at \xe2\x88\x9225 \xc2\xb0C. The substituent dependent phenomena are also observed in EPR spectra taken in frozen CH2Cl2 solution at 4.2 K. While the unsubstituted complex gives a so called large gmax type signal at 3.65, the alkyl substituted complexes exhibit axial type spectra; the EPR parameters for [Fe(TiPrP)(CN)2]- are g\xe2\x8a\xa5 = 2.43 and g\xe2\x88\xa5 = 1.73. These results clearly indicate that the electronic ground state changes from the usual (dxy)2(dxz, dyz)3 to the unusual (dxz, dyz)4(dxy)1 as the substituent becomes bulkier. Analysis of the EPR g values reveals that the orbital of the unpaired electron has more than 90% dxy character in the alkyl substituted complexes. The unusual electron configuration is ascribed to the destabilization of dxy orbital and/or stabilization of dxz and dyz orbitals caused by the S4 ruffled structure of the alkyl substituted porphyrin ring. Thus, in a strongly ruffled low spin complex such as [Fe(TiPrP)(L)2]\xc2\xb1, electron configuration of iron is presented by (dxz, dyz)4(dxy)1 regardless of the kind and basicity of the axial ligand (L). In fact, low spin bis(pyridine) complex [Fe(TiPrP)(Py)2]+ gives a pyrrole signal at quite a low field, \xce\xb4 = +16.4 ppm at \xe2\x88\x9287 \xc2\xb0C, which is actually the lowest pyrrole signal ever reported for the low spin ferric porphyrin complexes. Correspondingly, the EPR spectrum taken at 77 K showed a clear axial type spectrum, g\xe2\x8a\xa5 = 2.46 and g\xe2\x88\xa5 = 1.59. In every case examined, (dxz,dyz)4(dxy)1 ground state is more or less stabilized by the addition of methanol as exemplified by the further downfield shift of the pyrrole proton and cyanide carbon signals together with the smaller EPR g\xe2\x8a\xa5 values. The methanol effect is explained in terms of the stabilization of dxz and dyz relative to dxy due to the hydrogen bond formation between coordinated cyanide and methanol. "
"Ga(CN)3 has been prepared for the first time with a new method for preparation of inorganic cyanides. Pure crystalline material is formed by reaction of Cl2GaN3 with SiMe3CN via elimination of SiMe3N3 and SiMe3Cl. Reaction of GaCl3 with SiMe3CN also provides Ga(CN)3. A new convenient route to GeMe3CN and SnMe3CN is described, but reactions of GaCl3 with these compounds result in Lewis acid\xe2\x88\x92base adducts. The composition of Ga(CN)3 was confirmed by spectroscopic and elemental analysis. Quantitative X-ray powder diffraction was used to refine the cubic structure, which has CN groups with orientational disorder in a Prussian-blue-like network structure. The symmetry is Pm3\xcc\x84m, a = 5.295(2) \xc3\x85. Ga is octahedrally surrounded by on average three C and three N atoms with a Ga\xe2\x88\x92(C,N) bond length of 2.072(2) \xc3\x85, and the C\xe2\x88\x92N bond length is 1.148(1) \xc3\x85. LiGa(CN)4 was prepared by reaction of Ga(CN)3 with LiCN and was characterized by quantitative X-ray diffraction. The symmetry is P4\xcc\x843m, a = 5.874(2) \xc3\x85, and the structure consists of LiN4 and GaC4 tetrahedra linked by C\xe2\x88\x92N bonds to form two interpenetrating networks of the Zn(CN)2 type. CuGa(CN)4 has a similar structure with a = 5.729(5) \xc3\x85, but Cu,Ga and/or C,N disorder cannot be ruled out. "
"X-ray absorption Fe\xe2\x88\x92K edge data on ferrous and ferric model complexes have been studied to establish a detailed understanding of the 1s \xe2\x86\x92 3d pre-edge feature and its sensitivity to the electronic structure of the iron site. The energy position and splitting, and intensity distribution, of the pre-edge feature were found to vary systematically with spin state, oxidation state, geometry, and bridging ligation (for binuclear complexes). A methodology for interpreting the energy splitting and intensity distribution of the 1s \xe2\x86\x92 3d pre-edge features was developed for high-spin ferrous and ferric complexes in octahedral, tetrahedral, and square pyramidal environments and low-spin ferrous and ferric complexes in octahedral environments. In each case, the allowable many-electron excited states were determined using ligand field theory. The energies of the excited states were calculated and compared to the energy splitting in the 1s \xe2\x86\x92 3d pre-edge features. The relative intensities of electric quadrupole transitions into the many-electron excited states were obtained and compared to the intensity pattern of the pre-edge feature. The effects of distorting the octahedral iron site to tetrahedral and square pyramidal geometries were analyzed. The contributions to the pre-edge intensity from both electric quadrupole and electric dipole (from 3d\xe2\x88\x924p mixing) intensity mechanisms were established for these distorted cases; the amount of 4p character and its distribution over the many-electron final states were experimentally estimated and compared to theoretical predictions from density functional calculations. The methodology was also applied to binuclear complexes, and a clear marker for the presence of a \xce\xbc-oxo Fe\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92Fe bridge was established. General trends in 3d\xe2\x88\x924p mixing are developed and discussed for a series of geometries and oxidation states of Fe complexes. The results presented should further aid in the interpretation of the 1s \xe2\x86\x92 3d pre-edge region of iron complexes and non-heme iron enzymes. "
"The enantioselectivities arising from a Pd-catalyzed Heck reaction (>98% ee) and an allylic alkylation (>90% ee) using a 3,5-di-tert-butyl-MeO\xe2\x88\x92BIPHEP chiral auxiliary (1) are reported. Higher ee\'s are observed with the 3,5-dialkyl substituents than with the unsubstituted parent MeO\xe2\x88\x92BIPHEP. It is proposed that the observed dialkyl \xe2\x80\x9cmeta-effect\xe2\x80\x9d, on enantioselectivity, is the combined result of a more rigid and slightly larger chiral pocket and that this effect will have some generality in homogeneous catalysis. Detailed NMR studies on the allyl complex [Pd(PhCHCHCHPh)(1)]PF6 (5), and the model hydrogenation catalyst [RuH(cymene)(1)]BF4 (6), reveal restricted rotation about several of the P\xe2\x88\x92C(ipso) bonds of the phosphorus substituents containing the 3,5-di-tert-butyl groups. The X-ray structure of 6 reveals that the cymene ligand is not symmetrically bound to the Ru atom. This observation is interpreted as an expression of the chiral pocket of 1. MM3* calculations on 6 support the NMR findings and reproduce the X-ray results. "
"The synthesis of a range of bi- and tetrametalated macrocyclic complexes based upon calix[4]arene, p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene and related tetraalkoxy derivatives, of type [{M(L)}2(calixarene-nH)]X4-n and [{M(L)}4(calixarene-2H)]X6 (M = Rh, Ir, Ru; L = Cp*, p-MeC6H4CHMe2; n = 0, 1, 2; X = BF4, CF3SO3, HSO4, I, ReO4, H2PO4, etc., not all combinations) is reported. A related trimetallic calix[5]arene derivative [{Ir(\xce\xb75-C5Me5)}3(p-tert-butylcalix[5]arene-H)][BF4]5 has also been synthesized. In all cases, the presence of the transition metal centers results in a significant enhancement in the acidity of the hydroxyl functionalities at the calixarene lower rim. For the tri- and tetrametalated derivatives, the host\xe2\x88\x92guest behavior of the calixarene is drastically altered such that anionic guest species are included within the molecular cavity. The function of the new tetrametallic hosts [{Ru(\xce\xb76-p-MeC6H4CHMe2)}4(\xce\xb76:\xce\xb76:\xce\xb76:\xce\xb76-C28H22O4)]6+ (15) and [{Ir(\xce\xb75-C5Me5)}4(\xce\xb76:\xce\xb76:\xce\xb76:\xce\xb76-C28H22O4)]6+ (16) as anion receptors has been confirmed by X-ray crystal structure investigations upon BF4- (15a, 16a), HSO4- (16c), SO42- (15c), and I- (15d) derivatives, which clearly demonstrate a cooperative effect arising from the arrangement of four metal centers about a common, rigid binding pocket, resulting in anion\xe2\x88\x92host contacts as low as 2.85 \xc3\x85 (BF4\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Ccalix). The anion binding properties of host 15 in aqueous solution have also been investigated by 1H NMR titration, giving binding constants in the range 100\xe2\x88\x92550 M-1 for nitrate and halide anions, with the binding constant decreasing in the order Cl- > Br- > I-. Significantly increased binding is observed in nonaqueous media. This novel form of anion complexation contrasts to the formation of weakly bound, van der Waals inclusion complexes commonly observed in calixarene chemistry. "
"The tautomerism in solid phase was studied by near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at the N K- and O K-edges and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in the N1s and O1s regions for five N-salicylideneaniline derivatives:\xe2\x80\x89 N,N\xe2\x80\x98-disalicylidene-1,6-pyrenediamine (DSPY), N,N\xe2\x80\x98-disalicylidene-p-phenylenediamine (BSP), N-(2-hydroxy-1-naphthylidene)-1-pyrenylamine (NPY), N,N\xe2\x80\x98-di(2-hydroxy-1-naphthylidene)-p-phenylenediamine (DNP), and the complex between DNP and 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (DNP-TCNQ). The NEXAFS spectral features were assigned by (1) the comparison with the core excitation spectra of reference compounds and (2) ab initio MO calculations of the core-excited states by the improved virtual orbital method using the relaxed Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock orbitals. The tautomeric structures were deduced by the intensity of peaks characteristic of the tautomers in OH- and NH-forms. The XPS spectra gave structures consistent with those by NEXAFS and also allowed quantitative estimation of the relative tautomer populations. The results range from the dominance of the OH-form in DSPY and BSP to a comparable mixture of the OH- and NH-forms in DNP and DNP-TCNQ. These structures are consistent with the previous estimation by X-ray diffraction (XD), except for DNP-TCNQ where XD suggested the NH-form dominance. The good correlation of the population by XPS with the C\xe2\x88\x92O bond length by XD supports the present conclusion for DNP-TCNQ. These results demonstrate the usefulness of NEXAFS as well as XPS for studying the tautomerism in hydrogen bonded systems. "
"An optically inactive polyacetylene, poly((4-carboxyphenyl)acetylene) (poly-1), exhibits an induced circular dichroism (ICD) in the UV\xe2\x88\x92visible region upon complexation with chiral amines and amino alcohols in DMSO and in the film, the sign of which reflects the stereochemistry including bulkiness, type (primary, secondary, or tertiary), and absolute configuration of the amines. Therefore, the polyacetylene can be used as a novel probe for determining the chirality of amines. Most primary amines and amino alcohols of the same configuration gave the same sign for the induced Cotton effect; however, secondary and/or tertiary amines used in the present study tended to show Cotton effect signs opposite to those of the primary amines and amino alcohols of the same configuration. The magnitude of the ICD likely increases with an increase in the bulkiness of the chiral amines. The complexation dynamics during the formation of the helical structure of poly-1 with chiral amines were investigated on the basis of the spin\xe2\x88\x92spin relaxation behavior and 1H NMR, CD, and optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) titrations. The complex formation of poly-1 with chiral amines such as 1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine and 2-amino-1-propanol exhibits a positive nonlinear effect between the enantiomeric excess of the chiral amines and amino alcohols and the observed ellipticity of the Cotton effects. The excess enantiomer bound to poly-1 may induce an excess of a single-handed helix (right- or left-handed helix), which may result in a more intense ICD than that expected from the ee of the amine. Moreover, it was found that the coexistence of achiral amines such as 1-aminoethanol also induced an excess of one helical sense of poly-1. "
"A new pulse scheme, HN(CO)C, is described for simultaneous measurement of three-bond 3JC\xe2\x80\x98C\xce\xb2 and 3JC\xe2\x80\x98C\xce\xb3 couplings in proteins uniformly enriched with 13C and 15N. The experiment is demonstrated for human ubiquitin and apo-calmodulin, which have rotational correlation times of 4 and 8 ns, respectively. A Karplus relation, 3JC\xe2\x80\x98C\xce\xb2 = 1.59 cos2(\xcf\x86 \xe2\x88\x92 120\xc2\xb0) \xe2\x88\x92 0.67 cos(\xcf\x86 \xe2\x88\x92 120\xc2\xb0) + 0.27 Hz, is obtained by correlating the ubiquitin 3JC\xe2\x80\x98C\xce\xb2 values with backbone \xcf\x86 angles from its crystal structure. Using these crystal structure \xcf\x86 angles, the root-mean-square difference (rmsd) between experimental 3JC\xe2\x80\x98C\xce\xb2 values and those predicted from the Karplus relation is 0.24 Hz. When using \xcf\x86 angles derived from 3JHNH\xce\xb1, 3JHNC\xce\xb2, 3JHNC\xe2\x80\x98, 3JH\xce\xb1C\xe2\x80\x98, and 3JC\xe2\x80\x98C\xe2\x80\x98, this rmsd decreases to 0.17 Hz. Peptide backbone \xcf\x86 angles can be derived from J couplings between either C\xe2\x80\x98i-1 or HNi and the three C\xce\xb1i substituents, C\xe2\x80\x98i, C\xce\xb2i, H\xce\xb1i. For 45 residues in ubiquitin all six couplings have been measured, and the \xcf\x86 angles derived for these residues from couplings involving HNi agree to within experimental error (rmsd = 7.7\xc2\xb0) with \xcf\x86 angles derived from the three J couplings to C\xe2\x80\x98i-1. This confirms that, on average, the angle between the C\xe2\x80\x98i-1\xe2\x88\x92 Ni \xe2\x88\x92 C\xce\xb1i and HNi\xe2\x88\x92 Ni \xe2\x88\x92 C\xce\xb1i planes is considerably less than 7.7\xc2\xb0 and excludes the possibility of large deviations from peptide bond planarity in \xce\xb1-helices. Intraresidue 3JC\xe2\x80\x98C\xce\xb3 couplings for aliphatic residues are found to range from 0.7 Hz for a gauche conformation to ca. 4 Hz for a trans conformation. "
"The adenosine derivative N6,N6-dimethyladenosine (DMA) shows dual fluorescence in solvents of different polarity. In addition to the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d fluorescence at 330 nm, another band is observed at 500 nm. The long wavelength emission dominates in aprotic solvents but is dynamically quenched by protic solvents. Steady-state and lifetime measurements show that the emissions originate from two excited state species; the short wavelength emission is from the directly populated excited state which irreversibly isomerizes into the species responsible for the long wavelength emission. It is conceivable to assign the long wavelength emitting species to a twisted intramolecular charge transfer state (TICT). The fluorescence quantum yield of the short wavelength emission is approximately 4 \xc3\x97 10-4 at room temperature and increases by three orders of magnitude when the temperature is lowered to 80 K in accordance with the behavior of normal nucleic acid bases. In contrast, the long wavelength fluorescence quantum yield is almost temperature independent. The different photophysical processes for DMA are summarized into a kinetic scheme where the temperature quenching of the short wavelength fluorescence is exclusively through isomerization into the long wavelength emitting species. Direct internal conversion to the ground state, commonly believed to be the dominant process for nonradiative deactivation of the DNA bases, makes a negligible contribution for DMA. "
"The formation of C6SiH7+ from phenylsilane was studied using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance spectrometry and by ab initio calculations. The (parent \xe2\x88\x92 H or D)+ ions were produced by electron impact (EI) dissociation of C6H5SiH3 and C6H5SiD3, and their bimolecular reactivities toward phenylsilane, cycloheptatriene, benzyl chloride, benzene-d6, and toluene-d8 were examined. The reactive component that abstracts hydride from phenylsilane and cycloheptatriene or chloride from benzyl chloride is mostly the phenylsilyl cation C6H5SiH2+. The identity of the unreactive component was characterized by collision-induced dissociation and bimolecular chemical reactivity. The low-energy collision-induced dissociation of the unreactive C6SiH7+ ion with argon yielded SiH+ with a loss of C6H6 and C6SiH5+ with a loss of H2 as the primary fragments. Vibrationally hot C6SiH7+ ions from EI of C6H5SiH3 reacted with benzene-d6 to form C6D6\xc2\xb7SiH+ adducts, which after few seconds of cooling delay remained unreactive toward cycloheptatriene. Ab initio calculations predict the hydride affinity of C6H6\xc2\xb7SiH+ that forms C6H6 + SiH2 to be comparable to or lower than that of tropylium ion. The chloride affinity of C6H6\xc2\xb7SiH+ that forms C6H6 + SiHCl is estimated to be \xe2\x88\xbc4 kcal mol-1 lower than that of the benzyl cation. Both experiment and theory suggest the C6H6\xc2\xb7SiH+ adduct as the unreactive C6SiH7+ component and not the silacycloheptatrienyl cation. The mechanism of the formation of C6H6\xc2\xb7SiH+ is presented based on the theoretical energetics of radical cations and the transition state for the [1,2] sigmatropic migration of an \xce\xb1-H.

"Hydrogen-bonding and protonation are fundamental factors controlling potentials and mechanisms in the reduction of quinones. These are studied systematically in benzonitrile, acetonitrile, and dimethylsulfoxide solutions by cyclic voltammetry of a series of quinones of increasing basicity (chloranil to duroquinone), in the presence of hydroxylic additives of increasing hydrogen-bonding power (tert-butyl alcohol to hexafluoro-2-propanol) or acidity (trifluoroacetic acid). Electrochemical effects are demonstrated over the complete interaction range, from hydrogen bonding of reduced dianions to protonation of unreduced quinones. With increasing concentrations of additives, three clearly different types of electrochemical behavior are observed for weakly (I), moderately (II), and strongly (III) interacting quinone-additive pairs, as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 (I) Two well-separated reduction waves, corresponding to formation of quinone mono- and dianions, shift positively, with no loss of reversibility. The second wave is smaller, shifts more strongly, and finally merges with the first. The relative heights of the waves remain constant. (II) The positive shift is accompanied by increasing height of the first peak and broadening and irreversibility of the second wave. (III) One or even two, more positively shifted, new prior waves appear, together with a new anodic wave. In interpreting these phenomena, the role of hydrogen-bonding is clearly distinguished from protonation on the basis of pKa values of relevant species, effects of solvent variation, magnitude of potential shifts, and the onset of irreversibility. Type I behavior is attributed to stabilization by hydrogen-bonding of mono- and dianion reduction products; the number of bonds per quinone ion and bonding equilibrium constants are estimated from the shifts in peak potentials with additive concentration. These results are supported by simulating the experimental cyclic voltammograms using these parameters. Type III behavior is assigned to initial hydrogen-bonding or protonation of the quinones. Type II is attributed to a reduction mechanism involving disproportionation of primary radicals, assisted by hydrogen-bonding or protonation of the dianion. "
"Laser-ablated beryllium atoms have been reacted with hydrogen cyanide (H12CN, H13CN, and D12CN) during condensation in excess argon at 6\xe2\x88\x927 K. In the matrix infrared spectrum, the major products observed are BeNC, BeCN, HBeNC, and HBeCN. Consistent with typical beryllium bonding, these new beryllium species are linear molecules. Density functional theory calculations on these products with the BP86 functional and 6-311G* basis sets predict vibrational frequencies extremely well, even for HBeCN where mixing between the nearly isoenergetic Be\xe2\x88\x92H and C\xe2\x8b\xaeN stretching modes causes significant complications in the spectra. Although B3LYP and MP2 calculations are more sophisticated than the BP86 method, they do not predict the vibrational frequencies of these products nearly as well. More important is the carbon 12/13 isotopic frequency ratio as a description of the normal modes, and the BP86 method generates 12/13 ratios much closer to observed values for HBeCN than frequency ratios from the more time-consuming CISD method.

"In this paper, we present spectroscopic evidence for the formation of water in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) microemulsions stabilized by an ammonium carboxylate perfluoro polyether (PFPE) surfactant. FTIR spectroscopy has been employed to determine the existence of \xe2\x80\x9cbulk\xe2\x80\x9d (hydrogen-bonded) water (H2O and D2O) at the core of the microemulsions, and to distinguish between this and the presence of \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d (monomeric) water dissolved in the scCO2 and builds on preliminary results described elsewhere (Johnston, K. P.; Harrison, K. L.; Clarke, M. J.; Howdle, S. M.; Heitz, M. P.; Bright, F. V.; Carlier, C.; Randolph, T. W. Science 1996, 271, 624). Cloud point studies confirm that optically transparent and thermodynamically stable microemulsion solutions are formed. We have investigated the utility of these microemulsions as novel environments for reaction chemistry. In particular, we have shown that, using the PFPE surfactant, an aqueous solution of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) may be dispersed in scCO2, leading to a purple-colored solution with concentration on the order of 5 \xc3\x97 10-4 M, as detected by UV\xe2\x88\x92vis absorption spectroscopy. Moreover, aqueous sodium nitroprusside (Na2[Fe(CN)5(NO)]) and potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) are also shown to be soluble in the water/PFPE/scCO2 microemulsions and to undergo simple aqueous inorganic reactions with gaseous reactants such as H2S and SO2. Methyl orange has been used to investigate the presence of a carbonic acid microenvironment in the water/PFPE/scCO2 microemulsions. "
"Two carotenoids, fucoxanthin and zeaxanthin, were covalently attached to each of five different pyropheophorbides. Singlet\xe2\x88\x92singlet energy transfer within these ten carotenopyropheophorbide compounds was measured by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and steady-state fluorescence excitation spectroscopy. In all five compounds containing fucoxanthin, energy transfer was found to occur from the higher-lying fucoxanthin S1 state to the lower-lying pyropheophorbide S1 state with 12\xe2\x88\x9244% efficiency. The multiple saturated bonds separating the \xcf\x80 systems of the fucoxanthin and pyropheophorbide molecules, the fact that the fucoxanthin S1 \xe2\x86\x94 S0 transition is partially allowed, and the good agreement between experimental and calculated energy transfer rates suggest that the Coulomb (F\xc3\xb6rster) mechanism is more important than the electron exchange (Dexter) mechanism for singlet\xe2\x88\x92singlet energy transfer in these compounds. In contrast, all five zeaxanthin-containing compounds showed no clear evidence of energy transfer from the zeaxanthin S1 state to the pyropheophorbide S1 state. This is consistent with placing the zeaxanthin S1 state energy level slightly below that of all the pyropheophorbides examined here. However, energy transfer efficiencies of up to 15% were observed from the zeaxanthin S2 state to the pyropheophorbide S1 state. These results suggest that several energy transfer mechanisms may operate simultaneously when carotenoid\xe2\x88\x92chlorophyll distances are short. "
"The reaction mechanism associated with the decomposition of three \xce\xb1-hydroxycarboxylic acids (glycolic, lactic, and 2-hydroxyisobutyric) in the gas phase to form carbon monoxide, water, and the corresponding carbonyl compounds has been theoretically characterized by using ab initio analytical gradients at the MP2 level of theory with the 6-31G** and 6-31++G** basis sets. A detailed characterization of the potential energy surface points out the existence of three competitive reaction pathways for the decomposition process. The first pathway describes a two-step mechanism, with water elimination and formation of an \xce\xb1-lactone intermediate, achieved by the nucleophilic attack of the carbonylic oxygen atom of the carboxyl group (mechanism A). The second pathway is also a two-step mechanism, but in this case the formation of the \xce\xb1-lactone is obtained by means of the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxylic oxygen atom of the carboxyl group (mechanism B). These two pathways share a common second step in which the \xce\xb1-lactone decomposes. The third pathway is a one-step process in which the decomposition of the corresponding \xce\xb1-hydroxy acid takes place in a concerted fashion (mechanism C). The geometrical parameters of the stationary points appearing along the three pathways and the components of the transition vectors associated to the transition structures calculated using the 6-31G** basis set are similar to those calculated with the larger 6-31G++G** basis set. The decomposition is favorable along pathway A, and the first step can be considered as the rate-limiting step for the global process. The rate constant values for this step increase in the order of glycolic, lactic, and 2-hydroxyisobutyric acids due to the stabilization of the incipient carbocationic center on C3 with the substitution of hydrogen atoms by methyl groups. The apparent first-order rate constants calculated by transition state theory agree well with the experiments reported by Chuchani and co-workers. "
"The initial acylation step in the \xce\xb2-lactamase catalyzed hydrolysis of \xce\xb2-lactams is studied using an ab initio quantum mechanical approach. The computational model incorporates a simple \xce\xb2-lactam substrate and key residues found in the active site in order to assess the plausibility of a specific mechanism originally proposed by Strynadka et al.1 and to estimate the stabilizing effects of the oxy-anion hole components founds in these enzymes. The computational model was constructed using information obtained from a high resolution X-ray crystal structure of unbound native \xce\xb2-lactamase, isolated from Staphylococcus aureus PC1. Within this model, the overall acylation reaction was found to occur with modest activation energy <26 kcal mol-1 (<109 kJ mol-1) through a microscopic pathway characterized by discrete proton transfer steps between the substrate and the active site residues Ser-70, Lys-73, and Ser-130. These energetic results are considerably lower than the activation energies found for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of simple amides in the gas phase. Interestingly, the energetic stabilization of the components, which make up the oxy-anion hole, were found to be modest with only one stationary point on the potential energy surface being significantly reduced by \xe2\x88\xbc8 kcal mol-1 (\xe2\x88\xbc33 kJ mol-1).

"Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the conversion of nucleotides to deoxynucleotides. An initial step in this process has been postulated to be a coupled proton and electron transfer between the essential tyrosyl radical (\xe2\x80\xa2Y122) on the R2 subunit and a cysteine residue (C439) on the R1 subunit, the site of nucleotide reduction. One of our long-term goals is to generate the cysteinyl radical on R1 in the absence of R2 using a photoreactive peptide that binds to the R2 binding site of R1. Toward this end, the synthesis of an N-hydroxypyridine-2-thione derivative of tryptophan, designed to generate a tryptophan radical with a quantum of near-UV/visible light, is described. Laser flash photolysis (\xce\xbbexc = 355 nm) of this derivative gave rise to a transient absorption spectrum which showed a ground state depletion centered at its absorption maximum near 370 nm and a broad absorption band at 490 nm. The latter band partially decayed with a lifetime of \xe2\x88\xbc3 \xce\xbcs to leave an underlying band at 510 nm with a much longer lifetime. We have assigned the transient at 490 nm to the 2-pyridylthiyl radical and the transient at 510 nm to the neutral tryptophan radical. The addition of methyl methacrylate, a known thiyl radical quencher, suppressed the transient at 490 nm while the addition of trifluoroacetic acid caused a shift in the tryptophan radical absorbance to 560 nm consistent with protonation to form the corresponding cation radical. Using comparative actinometry, the quantum yields for N\xe2\x88\x92O bond cleavage and tryptophan radical formation were found to be 1.0 \xc2\xb1 0.1. This selective method for generating tryptophan radical, when incorporated into the appropriate peptide, may make this a useful probe for the study of electron transfer between the R1 and R2 subunits of RNR and may be generally applicable to other systems.

"The bicyclic diacid 1 was designed as a semi-rigid template for the hydrogen-bonding pattern of a peptide \xce\xb1-helix. The protected precursor 7 was synthesized in eight steps from tert-butyl 3,5-dimethoxybenzoate and linked to l-alanine and l-lactic acid to provide derivatives appropriate for coupling to a peptide. Both the amide 8-N and the ester 12-O were obtained in each of the four diastereomeric forms. The structure of R,R-8-N was determined by X-ray crystallography, which facilitated assignment of the diastereomers and confirmed the intended conformational effects of the quaternary methyl groups. The bicyclic amide and ester derivatives were appended to the peptide EALAKA-NH2, and their influence on the conformation was evaluated in aqueous solution using circular dichroism and NMR. The amide analogs have only a slight effect on the appended peptide, whereas the ester-linked template in S,S-9-O induces 32\xe2\x88\x9250% helical character at 23 \xc2\xb0C and 49\xe2\x88\x9277% at 0 \xc2\xb0C, depending on the method of determination; significant helical character persists even at 70 \xc2\xb0C. The ability of the template 1 to induce the helical conformation is related to its structural and electronic complementarity to the N-terminus of the peptide; templating ability disappears when the carboxylate in S,S-9-O is protonated, and it is not observed in the dimethylamide S,S-9-N-a. The structural and dynamical properties of conjugate S,S-9-O were studied by NMR and compared with those of the acetylated heptapeptide 13. The dispersion and temperature dependence of amide hydrogen chemical shifts and the pattern observed for intra- and inter-residue nuclear Overhauser enhancements are all consistent with a significant population of helical conformers within the conformational ensemble of conjugate S,S-9-O, in contrast to the unstructured peptide 13. The generalized order parameter S2 was derived for each residue from the 15N T1 and T2 relaxation rate constants and 1H\xe2\x88\x9215N heteronuclear NOEs determined for the 15N-labeled derivative of S,S-9-O; these parameters demonstrate a high degree of conformational rigidity along the peptide chain at 4 \xc2\xb0C, with relative motion increasing for the C-terminal residues. These data are consistent with the chiroptical studies and demonstrate that the template is exceptionally effective in inducing helical behavior in an appended peptide. "
"By observing isolated long DNA chains with fluorescence microscopy, the collapsing transition of individual single DNAs induced by polyethylene glycol with pendant amino groups (PEG-A) was compared to that induced by neutral polyethylene glycol (PEG). The main results are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) DNA is collapsed by PEG-A at concentrations 105 times lower than those required for PEG. (2) In PEG-A, the concentration which induces collapse decreases with an increase in the salt concentration. This trend is similar to that in the collapse induced by PEG. (3) The transition induced by PEG is all-or-none; individual DNA chains exhibit either elongated coil or compacted globule states. On the other hand, segregation of a collapsed region along a single DNA chain occurs as an intermediate state in the collapsing transition induced by PEG-A. "
"The reductive ring opening of oxabicyclic compounds has been achieved. While RMgBr/MgBr2 works in a few limited substrates, diisobutylaluminum hydride reacts with oxabicyclic[3.2.1]- and -[2.2.1]alkenes to provide cycloheptenols and cyclohexenols in good yield and in some cases in good regioselectivity. With some substrates further reduction of the alkene was observed which led us to examine transition metals such as nickel which are known to accelerate the hydroalumination reaction. The reaction with Ni(COD)2 (COD = cyclooctadiene) gave the best reactivity\xe2\x88\x92selectivity profile, and significantly higher yields were obtained with minimal overreduction of the alkene. Phosphine ligands were shown to dramatically improve the regioselectivity of ring opening of bridgehead-substituted oxabicyclic compounds. The best ligand was 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane which gave up to 380:1 selectivity. A series of deuterium quenching experiments showed that the selectivity of the hydroalumination varies according to the reaction protocol and ligand-metal ratio. "
"Intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) of preformed ruthenium cyclopentadienyl cationic peptidyl \xcf\x80-complexes forms cyclic biphenyl ethers in convenient, high-yielding reactions. The utility of the method was demonstrated by the efficient convergent total synthesis of two natural products, K-13 and OF4949-III. Several analogs of K-13 and OF4949-I\xe2\x88\x92IV were synthesized in high yields, and one ring system that could not be prepared by a macrolactamization method was formed in high yield by biaryl ether formation from peptidyl ruthenium complexes. Direct comparisons between these two approaches are provided. Transition metal \xcf\x80-complexes of either N-protected or carboxyl-protected amino acids can be used as coupling partners in peptide coupling reactions. Preformed peptidyl ruthenium complexes can be used to synthesize cyclic biphenyl ethers in a combinatorial fashion. "
"The use of pseudoephedrine as a practical chiral auxiliary for asymmetric synthesis is described in full. Both enantiomers of pseudoephedrine are inexpensive commodity chemicals and can be N-acylated in high yields to form tertiary amides. In the presence of lithium chloride, the enolates of the corresponding pseudoephedrine amides undergo highly diastereoselective alkylations with a wide range of alkyl halides to afford \xce\xb1-substituted products in high yields. These products can then be transformed in a single operation into highly enantiomerically enriched carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones. "
The protonation behavior of poly(propylene imine) dendrimers and some related oligo amines has been measured using natural abundance 15N-NMR. The chemical shifts of the different shells of nitrogen nuclei as a function of pH have been directly interpreted as the degree of protonation for that shell. The thus obtained protonation behavior is described systematically using the Ising model which only requires values for the intrinsic protonation constants and for the pair interaction free energies between the different nitrogen nuclei. This subsequently leads to a quantitative description of the titration curves of the individual shells and to a rationalization of the microscopic and macroscopic equilibrium constants for these molecules. 
"Two new isomeric bis(trans-fused cyclohexano) substituted 1,4,7,10,13-pentaazacyclopentadecane ligands and their Mn(II) complexes, 3 and 4, have been synthesized, and their activity as superoxide dismutase (SOD) catalysts has been studied. Complex 3 is an excellent SOD catalyst with a second-order rate constant at pH = 7.4 of 1.2 \xc3\x97 10+8 M-1 s-1. In contrast, the isomeric complex 4 has virtually no detectable catalytic SOD activity, implying the need to understand the effect that the position, number, and stereochemistry of substituents exert on the catalytic rate. The crystal structure of the complex 4 was determined and reveals that the Mn(II) ion is coordinated in a pentagonal bipyramid array of the five nitrogens of the macrocyclic ligand and capped by two trans-chloro ligands. Crystal data for MnC18H37Cl2N5 are as follows: triclinic at 20 \xc2\xb0C, space group P1--Ci2 (no. 2); a = 9.746(3) \xc3\x85, b = 12.631(6) \xc3\x85, c = 11.311(5) \xc3\x85; \xce\xb1 = 73.14(4)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb2 = 76.39(3)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb3 = 79.98(3)\xc2\xb0, V = 1287(1) \xc3\x853, and Z = 2 (\xcf\x81calc = 1.279 g/cm3; \xce\xbca Mo K\xce\xb1 = 6.23 mm-1). Mechanistic studies with the complex 3 and the pentamethyl susbstituted complex, 5, including D2O rate studies, are reported and are consistent with the existence of two pathways for the rate-determining electron-transfer from Mn(II) to superoxide:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) hydrogen atom transfer from a bound water on Mn(II) to HO2\xe2\x80\xa2 to yield a Mn(III) hydroxo intermediate and (2) the dissociative pathway in which superoxide anion binds to a vacant coordination site on Mn(II) followed by protonation/oxidation to yield a Mn(III)hydroperoxo species. Subsequent reduction of the intermediate Mn(III) with superoxide anion completes the catalytic cycle. Substituent effects on the rates and relative contribution of the two pathways to the overall rate of SOD activity is ascribed to the propensity of the ligand to fold around Mn(II) forming a pseudo-octahedral complex similar in geometry to the oxidized Mn(III) complex. Folding of the pentaaza macrocyclic ligand is confirmed as a relevant structural motif for this series of Mn(II) complexes by the X-ray structure determination of the bis(nitrate) derivative of 1, [Mn(C10H25N5)NO3]NO3, which reveals a six-coordinate structure with a folded conformation of the macrocyclic ligand. Crystal data for [Mn(C10H25N5)NO3]NO3:\xe2\x80\x89 orthorhombic at \xe2\x88\x92100 \xc2\xb0C, space group P212121; a = 9.457(2) \xc3\x85, b = 12.758(2) \xc3\x85, c = 13.834(2) \xc3\x85, V = 1669.1(5) \xc3\x853, and Z = 4 (\xcf\x81calc = 1.549 g/cm3).

"The complex [Cp*RuCl(dippe)] reacts with 1-alkynes in MeOH in the presence of NaBPh4, yielding the metastable hydrido\xe2\x88\x92alkynyl derivatives [Cp*Ru(H)(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCR)(dippe)][BPh4] (R = COOMe, Ph or SiMe3), intermediates in the formation of the corresponding vinylidene complexes, to which these compounds rearrange both in solution and in the solid state. The X-ray crystal structures of the isomers [Cp*RuCCHCOOMe(dippe)][BPh4] and [Cp*RuH(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCCOOMe)(dippe)][BPh4] have been determined. Kinetic studies show that the mechanism for this isomerization process seems to be dissociative and that it is inhibited in solution by strong acids. In contrast with this, no hydrido\xe2\x88\x92alkynyl complex has been observed in the course of the reaction of 1-alkynes with [CpRuCl(dippe)]. Instead, the alkyne adducts have been detected, and isolated in some cases. Such species have only been observed in the Cp*Ru system for acetylene, and [Cp*Ru(\xce\xb72-HC\xe2\x8b\xaeCH)(dippe)]+ seems to be in equilibrium with the corresponding hydrido\xe2\x88\x92alkynyl complex [Cp*RuH(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCH)(dippe)]+, which isomerizes to [Cp*RuCCH2(dippe)]+ via the formation of the \xcf\x80-alkyne complex. The effects on these tautomerization processes of the phosphine, Cp*, and Cp ligands, as well as the R group of the alkyne, are discussed. "
The magnetic properties of oxo-bridged oxo-(carboxylato)-bridged and oxo-bis(carboxylato)-bridged iron(III) dimers are found to depend on the iron\xe2\x88\x92(\xce\xbc-O) distance as well as on the iron\xe2\x88\x92(\xce\xbc-O)\xe2\x88\x92iron angle. With an angular and radial overlap model we account for both these dependencies. The use of an angular overlap model allows us to separate the \xcf\x83 donor properties of oxide as a ligand into the s\xcf\x83 and p\xcf\x83 contributions. 
"The reactions of the radical cations of vinyl chloride (1) and vinyl bromide (2) with ammonia in the gas phase have been studied by FT-ICR spectrometry and ab initio molecular orbital calculations. The FT-ICR experiments show that vinyl halide radical cations react mainly by substitution of the halogen atom, yielding C2H6N+ product ions and moderately by formation of NH4+ with a total reaction efficiency of 57% (1\xe2\x80\xa2+) and 35% (2\xe2\x80\xa2+), respectively. The initial formation of NH3D+ from 1-d3\xe2\x80\xa2+ and 2-d3\xe2\x80\xa2+ establishes a direct deprotonation of the radical cations by NH3. Ab initio calculations confirm an exothermic deprotonation for all possible halovinyl radicals as the neutral product. The structure of the substitution product ions C2H6N+ was investigated by CA mass spectrometry and gas-phase titration experiments. The results show the presence of vinylammonium ions 5+ and acetaldiminium ions (6+) in the product ion mixture, but additional experiments reveal that 6+ is generated by a base catalyzed isomerization of initially formed 5+ (\xe2\x80\x9cshuttle mechanism\xe2\x80\x9d). The reaction energy profiles of the reactions of the vinyl halide radical cations 1\xe2\x80\xa2+ and 2\xe2\x80\xa2+ with ammonia were calculated by ab initio methods. The addition of NH3 is very exothermic for both radical cations generating chemically activated distonic ammonium ions in the first reaction step. The addition proceeds regioselectively (Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov), yielding preferentially an unreactive distonic ion by the Markovnikov orientation. This intermediate has to rearrange by a 1,2-NH3 shift before eventually decomposing into vinylammonium ions 5+ by loss of the halogen atom. It is suggested that this rearrangement corresponds to the \xe2\x80\x9cbottle neck\xe2\x80\x9d of the substitution process. The activation energy of the 1,2-NH3 shift in the chloro- and bromo-substituted distonic ion is not significantly different, but the increased chemical activation of the chloro derivative results in an increased reaction efficiency for the total substitution process for the vinyl chloride radical cation. The ab initio calculations reveal further that the generation of the more stable substitution product acetaldiminium ion 6+ is inhibited by a large activation barrier for the hydrogen rearrangements necessary within the intermediate distonic ion.

"The energy thresholds for fragment ions from the collision-induced dissociation of the protonated amino acid glycine (Gly), glycinamides Gly-NH2 and Gly-NHCH3, the dipeptides Gly-Gly and Gly-Gly-NH2, and the peptides Gly-Gly-Gly and Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly were determined with a modified triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The precursor ions were produced by electrospray. The threshold energies for the formation of the major fragment ions were determined by fitting the experimentally determined threshold curves to theoretical threshold equations following the procedure developed by Armentrout and co-workers. To obtain corrections for the kinetic shifts, several of the transition states were modeled by using ab initio or semiempirical calculations. The immonium ion, CH2NH2+, which is an a1 ion, was observed as a major fragment ion from precursor ions (H2NCH2CO-X)H+, where X = OH, NH2, NHCH3, and NH2COOH. The activation energies obtained from the thresholds were between 40 and 50 kcal/mol. These energies were in good agreement with theoretically evaluated activation energies for transition states based on a mechanism proposed by Harrison and co-workers. A second pathway leading to XH2+ (y1) ions was observed for X = NHCH3 and NHCH2COOH. The threshold based activation energy was somewhat lower than that for the a1 ions. Agreement between the threshold based activation energy and the calculated activation energy for a transition state involving an aziridinone intermediate provides support for the mechanism proposed by Wesdemiotis and co-workers. The lowest energy fragmentation pathway for ions with the general structure +H(Gly-Gly-X) was found to be the b2 (acylium) ion. In the case where X = NH2, the activation energy was only 20.4 kcal/mol. This very low energy was found consistent with the b2 ions being cyclic, protonated oxazalones, as proposed by Harrison and co-workers. The thresholds for the fragment ions from larger precursor ions were affected by very large kinetic shifts and supression by competitive decompositions. Accurate activation energies for these reactions could not be obtained. Nevertheless, the threshold curves provide a view of the evolution into the complex pathways occurring for the higher polypeptides. "
"The results of ab initio calculations on 1,3,5-trimethylenebenzene (1) and its negative ion (1-) are presented. Geometries were optimized at the CASSCF/6-31G* and CASSCF/6-31+G* levels. Single-point calculations were performed using second-order perturbation and multireference configuration interaction (MR-CI) methods, in order to include the effects of dynamic correlation between the \xcf\x83 and \xcf\x80 electrons. The ground state of 1 is predicted to be the high spin 4A1\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 state, which has D3h symmetry. The lowest energy excited state is 2E\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 in D3h symmetry and is thus subject to first-order Jahn\xe2\x88\x92Teller distortions to geometries of lower symmetry. The C2v geometries of the two Jahn\xe2\x88\x92Teller distorted components of 2E\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98, 2B1 and 2A2, have been optimized and are found to have nearly the same energies. After correction for zero-point energy differences, the adiabatic energy separation between the lowest C2v doublet and the D3h quartet ground state of 1 is computed to be 14 \xc2\xb1 1 kcal/mol. The ground state of 1- is predicted to be 3E\xe2\x80\x98 in D3h symmetry. Molecular distortion to C2v symmetry stabilizes the 3B2 component of 3E\xe2\x80\x98 via not only first- but also second-order Jahn\xe2\x88\x92Teller effects. Consequently, the 3B2 component of 3E\xe2\x80\x98, at its optimized geometry, is calculated to be lower in energy by ca. 1.5 kcal/mol than the 3A1 component at its optimized geometry. The lowest singlet excited state of 1- is 1A1\xe2\x80\x98 in D3h symmetry, which is predicted to undergo second-order Jahn\xe2\x88\x92Teller distortions, at least at the CASSCF level of theory. The resulting state, 1A1 in C2v symmetry, is calculated to be 4\xe2\x88\x926 kcal/mol above the 3B2 ground state but slightly below a 3A2\xe2\x80\x98 excited state of D3h symmetry. In contrast to CASSCF and MR-CI, UB3LYP/6-31+G* calculations predict 3A2\xe2\x80\x98 to be the ground state of 1-, slightly below either component of the Jahn\xe2\x88\x92Teller distorted 3E\xe2\x80\x98 state. The UB3LYP calculations afford an estimate of 21\xe2\x88\x9222 kcal/mol for the electron affinity of 1 and provide vibrational frequencies for the 4A1\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 state. On the basis of computational results for 1 and 1-, the most important features of the photoelectron spectrum of 1- are predicted. "
"The linear and nonlinear optical properties of donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor \xcf\x80-electron chromophores having conjugated bridges varying in aromaticity and electron excessivity are investigated using the INDO/1 semiempirical Hamiltonian. NLO response properties of such chromophores are more sensitive to the electron excessivity of the bridges than to bridge aromaticity. Electron-excessive/deficient heterocyclic bridges have lesser/greater tendency to deplete the electron density from the donor/acceptor groups and thus increase their donor/acceptor ability. Thus, electron-excessive heterocyclic bridges act as auxiliary donors while electron-deficient heterocyclic bridges act as auxiliary acceptors, significantly enhancing NLO response. Interposing charged five-membered auxiliary donor and acceptor fragments between strong donor or acceptor groups results in large computed second-order NLO response. "
"Ab initio computations are described of the conformers and bond dissociation energies of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) with the Becke3-Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) nonlocal density functional and the standard 6-31G* and 6-311G** Gaussian basis sets. Five conformational minima, closely spaced in energy, were located at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The experimental gas-phase and solid-phase geometries for RDX are compared with the B3LYP/6-31G* geometries. The rather short N\xe2\x88\x92N bonds in the experimental crystal structure suggest that intermolecular interactions lead to enhanced donation of the amine lone pair into the nitro group in the solid state. The RDX nitrogen and carbon radicals have key roles in thermal decomposition of RDX. The B3LYP/6-311G** computed estimates for the N\xe2\x88\x92NO2 and the C\xe2\x88\x92H dissociation energies (Do) in RDX are respectively 42 and 85 kcal/mol. Compared with computed N\xe2\x88\x92NO2 and C\xe2\x88\x92H bond strengths in related molecules, the bonds in RDX are rather weak. This suggests that initiation of decomposition by N\xe2\x88\x92N cleavage and propagation of the decomposition by hydrogen atom transfers should be facile. "
"The cleavage of radical anions of substituted \xce\xb1-phenoxyacetophenones, X-C6H4COCH2OPh, IIa\xe2\x88\x92k, has been studied in DMF by voltammetric and coulometric techniques. The standard potentials (E\xc2\xb0) for formation of and rate constants, k, for the cleavage of the radical anions were determined using linear sweep voltammetry, LSV, together with digital simulation and previously reported laser flash photolysis data. The rate constants cover a range of almost eight orders of magnitude (0.4 s-1 for X = p-MeCO- to 1.3\xc2\xb7107 s-1 for X = p-MeO\xe2\x88\x92). The relative driving forces, \xce\x94\xce\x94G\xc2\xb0het(RX\xe2\x80\xa2-), for the heterolytic cleavage of the radical anions (to give R\xe2\x80\xa2 + X-) were estimated from thermochemical cycles. A combined plot of log(k) versus \xce\x94\xce\x94G\xc2\xb0het(RX\xe2\x80\xa2-) for the radical anions of IIa\xe2\x88\x92k and of \xce\xb1-aryloxyacetophenones gave a curve with \xce\xb1 = 0.5 at high driving forces and \xce\xb1 = 1 at low driving forces, where \xce\xb1 = \xe2\x88\x82\xce\x94 /\xe2\x88\x82\xce\x94G\xc2\xb0. The plot was analyzed using a model in which reversible cleavage of the radical anions takes place inside the solvent cage followed by (counter)diffusion of the fragments out of the solvent cage. The change in the value of \xce\xb1 is interpreted as a change in the rate limiting process from chemical activation (i.e.,, fragmentation) to counterdiffusion. The model allowed the determination of the absolute values of \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0het(RX\xe2\x80\xa2-) and the intrinsic barrier, \xce\x94 , for the fragmentation of the radical anions (8 \xc2\xb1 1 kcal mol-1, 0.35 eV). This leads to an estimate of the homolytic bond dissociation free energy of the C\xe2\x88\x92OPh bond in the unsubstituted \xce\xb1-phenoxyacetophenone. "
"The electrochemical deposition of ethanethiolate monolayers on Ag(111) has been investigated by in-situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM), and voltammetric methods. In aqueous 0.2 M NaOH solutions containing 5 mM ethanethiolate, the voltammetric response at Ag(111) displays two well-resolved surface waves with half-wave potentials (E1/2) of \xe2\x88\x921.17 and \xe2\x88\x920.95 V vs Ag/AgCl. The two-wave voltammetric response suggests a mechanism of monolayer deposition that consists of two energetically-distinct reaction steps, a conclusion supported by in-situ SERS and EQCM measurements of the potential-dependent adsorption isotherm. The voltammetric wave located at more negative potentials (E1/2 = \xe2\x88\x921.17 V) has a nearly ideal Nernstian shape and is associated with the initial rapid oxidative adsorption of ethanethiolate at submonolayer coverage. The second wave at more positive potentials (E1/2 = \xe2\x88\x920.95 V) corresponds to additional, but kinetically slower, oxidative adsorption of ethanethiolate resulting in an essentially complete monolayer (\xe2\x88\xbc7.8 \xc3\x97 10-10 mol/cm2). The slower kinetics associated with this wave, as well as general features of the wave shape, suggest that structural ordering of the monolayer occurs during the second oxidation. A thermodynamic expression for the dependence of E1/2 on the bulk solution concentration of ethanethiolate is derived and employed to determine the number of electrons transferred, n = 1.06 \xc2\xb1 0.06, per molecule of ethanethiolate adsorbed on the Ag(111) surface. A value of n = 0.90 \xc2\xb1 0.14 has also been independently determined by EQCM and coulometric measurements of the mass adsorbed and electrical charge consumed, respectively, during monolayer deposition.

"Polycationic high-spin states of 1,3-bis(diarylamino)benzene and 1,3,5-tris(diarylamino)benzene as prototypical model units for organic ferromagnetic metals have been studied by cw and pulsed ESR spectroscopy. An electron spin transient nutation (ESTN) method as a novel technique based on pulsed ESR spectroscopy has been applied to the dicationic and tricationic high-spin states of them in glasses, unequivocally identifying the spin multiplicities of those molecules in the ground state to be triplet with the fine-structure parameters of |D| = 0.007 cm-1 and quartet with |D| = 0.004 cm-1, |E| = 0.0002 cm-1, and g = 2.0023, respectively, and concluding that the high-spin ground states originate from the topological pseudodegeneracy of the \xcf\x80-HOMOs which governs spin alignment in polycationic heteroatomic systems. It has been illustrated by the resolution enhancement inherent in the dimensional decomposition of 2D spectroscopy that magnetic-field-swept 2D ESTN spectroscopy is a powerful and facile method for spin identification and discrimination between different spin multiplicities in nonoriented systems. Also, ESTN phenomena have been treated in terms of both numerical calculation and perturbation theory. An analytical expression for the nutational motion has been derived. "
"We have performed resonance Raman and optical absorption studies on ferric cytochrome P450cam complexed with oxidized putidaredoxin. Optical absorption and resonance Raman measurements demonstrate that this complexation shifts the spin-state equilibrium of P450cam to the low-spin form. In the resonance Raman spectra, the \xce\xbd3 heme skeletal mode characteristic of low-spin P450cam intensifies upon complexation with putidaredoxin. Its frequency is indistinguishable to that of the usual low-spin species, indicating that this low-spin form originates from a water-bound, hexacoordinate heme. This observation suggests that putidaredoxin binding affects the distal side of P450cam and allows water entry into the heme pocket. We also examined the effects of putidaredoxin binding on the heme axial ligand (Fe\xe2\x88\x92S) stretching mode. The binding of putidaredoxin upshifts the mode by \xe2\x88\xbc3 cm-1. Investigations of the Fe\xe2\x88\x92S mode for the Thr252 \xe2\x86\x92 Ala distal pocket mutant and P450cam bound to various camphor analogues demonstrate that the frequency of the \xce\xbdFe-S is sensitive to distal pocket water. The water lowers the Fe\xe2\x88\x92S stretching frequency by \xe2\x88\xbc1 cm-1, demonstrating that the putidaredoxin-induced \xe2\x88\xbc3-cm-1 increase in the Fe\xe2\x88\x92S stretching frequency is not simply caused by the increased hydration of the heme pocket. We also found that the Fe\xe2\x88\x92S frequency is increased by \xe2\x88\xbc0.5 cm-1 in the presence of high salt concentrations. This result suggests that the shielding of positive charges at the proximal face of P450cam leads to an increased \xce\xbdFe-S frequency. The salt effect is consistent with the observation that the binding of negatively charged putidaredoxin at the proximal side of the enzyme also increases the \xce\xbdFe-S frequency. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that electrostatic shielding of charged groups on the proximal face of P450cam takes place when putidaredoxin binds and contributes to the observed upshift of the Fe\xe2\x88\x92S mode.

"Heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy has been used to probe the structure and dynamics of a lead-dependent ribozyme known as the leadzyme. The pKa\'s for all adenine bases in the leadzyme were measured and vary from <3.1 to 6.5. The adenines with the lowest pKa\'s are involved in Watson\xe2\x88\x92Crick base pairs, and the adenine with the highest pKa is thought to form an AH+\xe2\x88\x92C wobble base pair at the active site of the leadzyme. The potential structural and functional significance associated with perturbed pKa\'s in ribozymes is discussed. NMR studies of 5\xe2\x80\x98 AMP, 5\xe2\x80\x98 CMP, 5\xe2\x80\x98 GMP, and 5\xe2\x80\x98 UMP were also used to identify the 13C resonances that represent the best probes of base protonation for all four bases in RNA. The line width of the C2 resonance of the adenine with a pKa of 6.5 was analyzed to probe the dynamics of the catalytically active internal loop in the leadzyme. These results showed that this adenine is undergoing a chemical exchange process with a lifetime of \xe2\x88\xbc30 \xce\xbcs and demonstrate rapid dynamics at the active site of this ribozyme. Thus 13C NMR can be used to probe dynamic processes in RNA oligomers. "
"Crystalline forms of the racemic and enantiomerically pure saturated zwitterionic phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine (PEM1), and phosphatidyl-N,N-dimethylethanolamine (PEM2) have been investigated using 13C and 31P cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR. The observed spectra indicate two types of packing behavior depending on the optical purity of phospholipids and the structure of a head group. The crystalline lattices of the enantiomerically pure PC, PE, PEM1, and PEM2 contained two conformations, whereas the corresponding racemic phospholipids contained only a single conformational species. On the basis of the known crystal structures of phospholipids, these results can be explained in terms of different ways the various zwitterionic phospholipids achieve packing into lattices with a minimal residual dipole moment. In enantiomerically pure PC and PE, the presence of two conformations, combining one configurational isomer of the diacyl glycerol moiety with two conformational mirror images of the head group, is necessary to eliminate the residual in-plane dipole moment of head groups and still achieve tight packing of the chiral diacylglycerol residue. In racemates, the in-plane dipole moment is eliminated by packing a single conformation into a true centrosymmetric lattice. The hydration of the crystalline phospholipid samples produced significant spectral alterations such as changes in the 13C chemical shifts of the diacylglycerol C2 carbon and carbonyl groups, and 31P NMR signals, suggesting conformational changes. The hydrated bilayers of both racemic and enantiomerically pure dipalmitoyl PC (DPPC) gave rise to identical 13C NMR spectra regardless the phase state, except for the most rigid Lc subgel phase. The invariance of chemical shifts in these gel phases indicated that no major conformational changes occurred during phase transitions of hydrated bilayers of PC. The NMR data presented in this work provide evidence that conformations of phospholipids in the crystalline state are strongly affected by packing forces and the tendency of the head groups to pack in true- or quasi-centrosymmetric lattices. On the other hand, conformations in hydrated bilayers are largely governed by the intrinsic conformational properties of monomeric molecules. The data presented address the problem of the relevance of the X-ray structures of crystalline phospholipids for evaluation of the conformations in the less ordered hydrated bilayers. "
"This paper reports the results of hot-electron lifetime measurements in a series of thin films prepared by wet chemistry techniques from 12-nm colloidal Au nanoparticles. The films, which vary in thickness and domain (or aggregate) size, are studied by a combined approach of femtosecond optical spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy. Atomic force microscope measurements are used to characterize the samples and quantify the film\'s growth pattern. Time-resolved laser spectroscopy measurements are used to determine hot-electron lifetimes. The dependence of the hot-electron lifetimes on the colloid film\'s structure is analyzed; the lifetimes range from 1 to 3 ps and decrease with greater aggregation. The lifetime is shown to vary in a predictable manner with the film\'s growth, and a model is presented to describe this relationship. This model allows for the prediction of hot-electron lifetimes over a broad range of film thicknesses and obtains asymptotic agreement with previous experimental results for Au polycrystalline films. Additionally, physical insight into the processes responsible for the range of lifetimes is obtained through an analysis that takes into account two competing phenomena:\xe2\x80\x89 electron inelastic surface scattering (ISS), which tends to increase electron\xe2\x88\x92phonon coupling with decreasing domain size, and electron oscillation\xe2\x88\x92phonon resonance detuning (EOPRD), which tends to decrease it. The relative contributions of each of these processes has been estimated and shown to agree with the theoretically-predicted tends. Finally, these results have implications for the nature of interparticle coupling and electron mobility. Specifically, they are consistent with and can be taken as evidence for an intercolloid electron conduction mechanism based on activated hopping. In short, the data presented herein and their analysis in terms of a size-dependent ISS and EOPRD shows that in thin films Au colloids aggregate in such a way as to be electronically coupled with one another while being physically separated by organic insulating groups. The films do, however, maintain physical characteristics and electronic influence based on the colloids from which they are built. "
"Quantum mechanical ab initio calculations at the MP2/VDZ+P level of theory (for some molecules at MP2/VTZ+D+P) are reported for the cations AX3+ and AH2X+ (A = C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; X = F, Cl, Br, I) and the isoelectronic neutral Lewis acids YX3 and YH2X (Y = B, Al, Ga, In, Tl; X = F, Cl, Br, I). The \xcf\x80-donor ability of the halogens given by the p(\xcf\x80) population at atom A increases for all cations with F < Cl < Br < I, which is the opposite to what has been reported in a recent study of Olah and co-workers (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 3580). The same trend is found at the central atom Y of most neutral compounds, but the increase is less pronounced than for the cations. The calculated order of the energetic stabilization of the cations and neutral compounds by the halogens is less uniform, because the \xcf\x83- and \xcf\x80-donation show different trends. The energies of isodesmic reactions and the X3A+\xe2\x88\x92OH2 complexation energies predict for the thermodynamic stabilization of the Y-conjugated cations the same trend as the \xcf\x80-donor ability, i.e. F < Cl < Br < I. The energy differences are much less for the isodesmic reactions of the singly substituted AH2X+ than for AX3+. Fluorine has a higher stabilizing effect in CH2F+ than in CF3+, because the \xcf\x83-withdrawing strength of F leads to a large positive charge at the carbon atom of CF3+. The complexation energies of the boron halides BX3 show little differences for X3B\xe2\x88\x92OH2 among the halogens, although the p(\xcf\x80) population at boron increases clearly from fluorine to iodine. The hydride affinity, however, increases strongly from BF3 to BI3 and from BH2F to BH2I. The heavy-atom homologues of C+, i.e. Si+, Ge+, Sn+, Pb+, and those of B, i.e. Al, Ga, In, Tl, show the same trends for the halogens, but the p(\xcf\x80) donation and the thermodynamic stabilization or destabilization is clearly less than for C+ and B, respectively.

"Shell cross-linked knedels (SCK\'s), nanometer-sized spherical particles that are composed of a core-shell morphology, were prepared by intramicellar polymerization of side chain functionalities along the backbone of the hydrophilic block of amphiphilic polystyrene-b-poly(vinylpyridine) block copolymers organized into micellar assemblies. Control over the size of the SCK\'s was demonstrated through variation of the chemistry and processing conditions. The solid-state SCK diameters (from atomic force microscopy) ranged from 8 to 30 nm, depending upon the chemical composition and micellization time. The relative amount and nature of hydrophilicity in the amphiphilic block copolymer precursor to the SCK\'s affects the propensity for aggregation, leading to differences in the aggregation numbers of polymer chains within the micelles and to differences in the dimensions of the SCK\'s. Therefore, increased lengths of the PS (hydrophobic) block in comparison to the PVP (hydrophilic) block gave larger aggregation numbers and larger SCK\'s. Alternatively, the incorporation of more quaternized sites along the PVP backbone (increased hydrophilicity) gave smaller SCK\'s. Quaternization of the PVP using poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) to give water soluble side chain grafts also resulted in decreased SCK diameters and more narrow size distributions, in comparison to the SCK with no PEO. Allowing longer times for micelle formation prior to cross-linking gave larger SCK\'s and broader size distributions, due to coalescence of the polymer micelles. "
"Replacement of the phosphodiester linkages of the polyanion RNA with guanidinium linkers provides the polycation ribonucleic guanidine (RNG). Molecular dynamics studies to 1080 ps of the hybrid duplex formed from an octameric RNG strand r(Ag)8 with a complementary DNA oligomer strand d(Tp)8 have been carried out with explicit water solvent and Na+Cl- counterions under periodic boundary conditions with use of the CHARMM force field and Ewald summation method. The Watson\xe2\x88\x92Crick hydrogen bonding pattern of the A/T tracts was maintained intact through the simulation without any structural restraints. Even for the two ends, only one end was partially frayed. The overall structure is equilibrated at a B-DNA conformation, and the RNG strand takes on the general conformation of the DNA backbone. The structural history of the RNG\xc2\xb7DNA duplex was determined by examining histograms from the dynamics run. The histograms are of the hydrogen bonding pattern (sequence recognition) and base pair opening occurrences, minor groove width narrowing (3 \xc3\x85), and bending of tracts. The bending angle measured between the local axis vectors of the first and last helical axis segments is about 33\xc2\xb0 for the averaged structure. Propeller twist (associated with three-centered hydrogen bonding) up to \xe2\x88\x9230\xc2\xb0, native to DNA AT base pairing, was also observed. The sugar pseudorotation phase angles and the ring rotation angles for the DNA strand are within the C3\xe2\x80\x98-endo domain. However, for the RNG strand the pseudorotation angles converted to O4\xe2\x80\x98-endo. "
"The covalent modification of proteins by phosphorylation and addition of GlcNAc residues are important regulatory processes which mediate biological signal transduction. For instance, the cytosolic form of RNA polymerase II is heavily glycosylated but during its transition from an initiating to an elongating complex the carbohydrates are removed and the protein is phosphorylated. For the study of such biological phenomena, characteristic peptides which embody both types of modifications may serve as efficient tools. However, their synthesis is complicated by their pronounced acid and base lability as well as their multifunctionality. These properties make the application of protecting groups necessary which can be removed under the mildest conditions. For the construction of such peptide conjugates the enzyme labile PhAcOZ urethane blocking group was developed. This protecting group embodies (a) a functional group (a phenylacetate) that is recognized by the biocatalyst (penicillin G acylase) and that is bound by an enzyme labile linkage (an ester) to (b) a functional group (a p-hydroxybenzyl urethane) that undergoes a spontaneous fragmentation upon cleavage of the enzyme-sensitive bond resulting in (c) the liberation of a carbamic acid derivative which decarboxylates to give the desired peptide or peptide conjugate. When this enzymatic protecting group technique was combined with classical chemical methods, a complex phosphoglycohexapeptide was built up, which embodies two glycosylated, one phosphorylated, and one underivatized hydroxyamino acid. This peptide represents a characteristic partial structure of the repeat sequence of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II which becomes glycosylated or phosphorylated while the enzyme carries out its biological functions. The conditions under which the enzymatic deprotections proceed are so mild that no undesired side reaction is observed (i.e., no rupture or anomerization of the glycosidic bonds and no \xce\xb2-elimination of the phosphate or a carbohydrate occur). In addition, the specificity of the biocatalyst guarantees that the peptide bonds and the other protecting groups present are not attacked either. "
"New pulse schemes for recording intermolecular NOEs in a molecular complex consisting of 15N,13C labeled and unlabeled components are presented. The pulse sequences select for magnetization transferred from protons on the unlabeled component to proximal protons of the labeled molecule. Filtering (suppression of signal from 13C labeled molecules) is accomplished using adiabatic 13C inversion pulses which are swept at a rate which is tuned according to the one-bond 1H\xe2\x88\x9213C scalar coupling vs carbon chemical shift profile of the labeled molecule in the complex. Significantly improved spectra are obtained relative to data recorded with other purging schemes. Improvements are demonstrated in experiments where intermolecular NOEs between labeled RNA-unlabeled peptide and labeled protein\xe2\x88\x92unlabeled peptide are recorded. A discussion of structural information obtained for a complex of the amino-terminal arginine rich domain of the N protein from bacteriophage \xce\xbb and boxB RNA using the new methodology is presented.

"We present unrestrained molecular dynamics studies on a deoxyribose dodecamer duplex d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 and its phosphoramidate (replacing O3\xe2\x80\x98 by NH) analog using particle mesh Ewald electrostatics1 and the Cornell et al. force field.2 The simulations were carried out beginning in both canonical A and B forms, which differ in RMS position by \xe2\x88\xbc6.5 \xc3\x85. These simulations, which were carried out for \xe2\x88\xbc1\xe2\x88\x921.5 ns, are consistent with experiment in that the unmodified dodecamer, whether started in A or B DNA, converges to a B structure which is closer to the observed X-ray structure (9bna) than canonical B. On the other hand, the phosphoramidate modified duplex, whether started in A or B forms, converges to an A form. In this duplex, however, the structure from the simulation begun in the B form has a dependence on the initial location of the N\xe2\x88\x92H hydrogen. In one of our simulations, we find base pair opening and closing at the end of the duplex. Specifically, in the simulation of d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 begun in the A form, base pair opening of the terminal G\xe2\x88\x92C base pair occurs at 400 ps, and then the bases remain unpaired for 700 ps before reclosing.

"The source of hydrogens for the quenching of the phenylene diradical produced by esperamicin A (espA) and by esperamicin C (espC) in the presence of specifically deuteriated, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) has been determined. Remarkably, both espA and espC were quenched at both positions of the diphenylene radical by exclusive abstraction of hydrogen from dsDNA. EspC, a predominantly ds-cleaver, afforded results consistent with 4\xe2\x80\x98- and 5\xe2\x80\x98-hydrogen transfer. EspA, a predominantly ss-cleaver, revealed no 4\xe2\x80\x98-hydrogen transfer; however, results were consistent with 5\xe2\x80\x98-hydrogen transfer and with the recently proposed 1\xe2\x80\x98-hydrogen transfer (Yu, L.; Golik, J.; Harrison, R.; Dedon, P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994, 116, 9733\xe2\x88\x929738). For espA, insufficient double strand DNA damage was produced to account for the role of DNA as the exclusive hydrogen source. In order to resolve this discrepancy, several reductants were used to activate espA and espC. The results indicated that a substantial portion of radical lesions produced in DNA by the esperamicins is subjected to repair by hydrogen transfer from the reductant. The efficiency of repair depended on the structural features of the reductant. The findings demonstrate that caution must be exercised when evaluating the propensity of DNA cleavers for ss- and ds-cleavage in the presence of reductants. "
"The core bicyclo[7.3.0]enediyne 3 has been synthesized from the protected cyclohexane-1,2-dione 6 and enediyne component 9. Conversion of 20 into more highly functionalized enediynes was accomplished by oxidation and amination to give 27. Protection of 27, and conversion into 31, gave on treatment with (MeO)2P(O)CH2CO2Me the lactone 32, which was transformed into the trisulfide 39. All attempts to deprotect 39, using conditions that other workers successfully applied to similar substrates, only resulted in the cyclic sulfides 42 and 43. "
"The unique DBH-type azoalkanes 1, which exhibit high intersystem crossing quantum yields, have made possible the exploration of the bimolecular photoreduction of the n,\xcf\x80* triplet-excited azo chromophore. In the laser-flash photolysis, amines were found to quench the triplet azoalkane 1a with high rate constants (kq ca. 108 M-1 s-1). Steady-state photolysis of the azoalkanes 1a and 1b (\xcf\x86ISC ca. 0.5) in the presence of primary, secondary, and tertiary aliphatic amines gave high chemical yields of the corresponding hydrazines 4a and 4b in competition with the unimolecular products, namely the housanes 2 and the aziranes 3. In contrast, the azoalkane 1c undergoes appreciable photoreduction only in neat amines, while the azoalkane 1d (\xcf\x86ISC ca. 0.10) is not reduced even under such conditions. Except for N,N-dimethylbenzylamine, the amine oxidation products of the azoalkane photoreduction are analogous to those obtained from the reactions of amines with triplet benzophenone. In marked contrast, the absolute quantum yields of photoreduction for azoalkanes 1 are substantially lower (0.01\xe2\x88\x920.06) than for benzophenone (0.3\xe2\x88\x921.0). Efficient deactivation of the triplet-excited states by charge-transfer ( ), which competes with hydrogen atom abstraction ( ), is postulated to account for the low quantum yields. The efficiencies of photoreduction follow the trend primary \xe2\x89\x88 tertiary \xe2\x89\xab secondary amines observed with benzophenone, for which secondary amines also display the poorest efficiency. Electron transfer to triplet-excited azoalkanes, analogous to benzophenone, is observed for amines with low oxidation potentials. Thus, when triphenylamine (Eox = 0.85 V versus SCE) is used, the formation of its radical cation can be readily detected by laser-flash photolysis. "
"Broad-band irradiation (\xce\xbbmax = 350 nm) of FvRu2(CO)4 (1, Fv = \xce\xb75:\xce\xb75-bicyclopentadienyl) resulted in rapid isomerization to colorless (\xce\xbc2-\xce\xb71:\xce\xb75-cyclopentadienyl)2Ru2(CO)4 (2) in a novel process involving a formal dinuclear oxidative addition to a C\xe2\x88\x92C bond. The product reverted to 1 upon heating in solution or in the solid state, under the latter conditions with an enthalpy change of \xe2\x88\x9229.8 (1.5) kcal mol-1. Mechanistic studies with a mixture of 1 and 1-d8 revealed the absence of label scrambling, pointing to intramolecular pathways. The quantum yield (0.15) was unaffected by the presence of CCl4, and no chlorination products were observed under these conditions. Irradiation of solutions of 1 or 2 with 300 nm light provided Fv(\xce\xbc2-\xce\xb71:\xce\xb75-cyclopentadienyl)2Ru4(CO)6 (6) or, in the presence of alkynes, the adducts FvRu2(CO)3(RCCR) (8\xe2\x88\x9210, R = H, C6H5, CO2CH3). Heating 1 and PR3 (R = CH2CH3, CH3, or OCH3) yielded FvRu2(CO)3(PR3) (12\xe2\x88\x9214), in which a fluxional process occurs characterized by intramolecular terminal to bridging carbonyl exchange. While 12 and 13 were inert, compound 14 rapidly and reversibly afforded the P(OCH3)3-substituted analog of 2 (15) upon irradiation with UV light. The two diastereomeric 3,3\xe2\x80\x98-di-tert-butyl-substituted fulvalene analogs of 1 (19) underwent the same reaction sequence with complete retention of stereochemistry, via the diastereomeric photoproducts 20. A double regiochemical labeling experiment proceeded with retention of connectivity and stereochemistry. A concerted mechanism for the photoisomerization is consistent with the experimental observations, but a biradical pathway cannot be ruled out. Kinetic data for the isomerizations of 2, 15, 20a, and 20b to their respective metal\xe2\x88\x92metal-bonded Fv precursors were determined. The entropies of activation (+7 to +21 eu) suggested a disordered transition state. A sequence involving reversible CO loss was ruled out through a crossover experiment with 2-13CO. Kinetic and labeling experiments point to a change in mechanism when the thermal reversion of 2 to 1 was run under CO (\xe2\x88\xbc1 atm). The occurrence of ligand-induced C\xe2\x88\x92C coupling was indicated through studies of the reactivity of 2 with P(CH3)3. Photoisomer 2 reacts with excess CCl4 to give FvRu2(CO)4Cl2) by yet another mechanism. As in the potoisomerization of 1, the thermal reversion of 2 may follow a concerted pathway, although biradical intermediates cannot be excluded. "
"Strongly acidic conditions are required to induce the Nazarov-type cyclization of aryl vinyl ketones, although chemical analogy with the Nazarov reaction would superficially imply a straightforward electrocyclization reaction of the O-protonated monocation. In this paper we describe the superacid-catalyzed prototype cyclization of 1-phenyl-2-propen-1-ones. The acidity dependence of these cyclization reactions as revealed by kinetic measurements strongly suggests the involvement of the O,O-diprotonated dication rather than the O-protonated monocation. That is, the cyclization of 1-phenyl-2-propen-1-ones represents an electrocyclization of the oxonium\xe2\x88\x92carbenium dication. We also describe the effect of substituents at the 2-position of 1-phenyl-2-propen-1-ones. Ab initio calculations, based on the density functional theory, support the idea that electrocyclization of the dication is energetically more favarable than that of the monocation. "
"The addition of different substituted allylsilanes 2 to unactivated alkynes 1 in the presence of catalytic amounts of HfCl4 or the EtAlCl2\xe2\x88\x92TMSCl catalyst system produced in high yields the silylated 1,4-dienes 3 regio- and stereoselectively. The exclusive trans manner of addition was confirmed by analysis of crude reaction mixtures by 1H NMR and capillary GLC methods. Good agreement of relative reactivities of reaction of various allylsilanes 2a\xe2\x88\x92e toward phenylacetylene (1a) in the presence of HfCl4 with the relative reaction rates of 2a\xe2\x88\x92e with carbenium ions supported the involvement of cationic species 11 as a reaction intermediate. The mechanisms for the HfCl4 and EtAlCl2\xe2\x88\x92TMS catalyzed trans-allylsilylation of alkynes are proposed. "
"Reaction of KOCH2CMe3 with [(R)-Tol-BINAP]Pd(p-C6H4CN)Br formed [(R)-Tol-BINAP]Pd(p-C6H4CN)(OCH2CMe3) (5) in quantitative yield (1H NMR spectroscopy). Thermolysis of 5 in THF-d8 at 47 \xc2\xb0C led to C\xe2\x88\x92O reductive elimination with formation of p-neopentoxybenzonitrile (85 \xc2\xb1 2%). A secondary P\xe2\x88\x92C bond-cleavage process led to formation of 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-dimethylbiphenyl (16 \xc2\xb1 2%). Kinetic analysis of the decomposition of 5 at 47 \xc2\xb0C in the presence of excess potassium neopentoxide established the two-term rate law, rate = k[5] + k\xe2\x80\x98[5][KOCH2CMe3], where k = 1.50 \xc2\xb1 0.07 \xc3\x97 10-3 s-1 and k\xe2\x80\x98 = 6.2 \xc2\xb1 0.4 \xc3\x97 10-3 s-1 M-1, consistent with reductive elimination via competing alkoxide-dependent and alkoxide-independent pathways. In addition, excess KOCH2CMe3 exchanged rapidly with the palladium-bound alkoxide ligand of 5 at 47 \xc2\xb0C according to the rate law:\xe2\x80\x89 rate exchange = kex[5][KOCH2CMe3], where kex = 1.0 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc3\x97 102 s-1 M-1.

"Ordered nonlamellar mesoporous aluminophosphates and galloaluminophosphates have been synthesized by introducing phosphate linking groups to cluster/surfactants salts of prearranged AlO4Al12(OH)24(H2O)127+ (Al13) and GaO4Al12(OH)24(H2O)127+ (GaAl12) tridecamers. The Al13 and GaAl12 polyoxocations form a layered mesoscopic salt with the anionic surfactant sodium dodecylsulfate. Upon the reaction with a buffered hydrogen phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate solution the layers of clusters are transformed into a nonlayered, nearly hexagonal mesoscopic phase. Removal of the surfactant from the alumino- and galloaluminophosphates by anion-exchange results in mesoporous materials with BET surface areas up to 630 and 455 m2/g, respectively. FT-IR and 27Al and 31P MAS\xe2\x88\x92NMR as well as 27Al \xe2\x86\x92 31P cross-polarization experiments indicate that the phosphate treatment results in the formation of new bonds between aluminate and phosphate species. A fraction of the clusters are transformed leading to an increase in the number of tetrahedral aluminate groups in the product. Multiple anion-exchange, e.g., with acetate, dichromate, or naphthol yellow S ions, is possible in these open mesoporous structures, which form a new class of inorganic anion-exchangers. "
"Studies of the thermolysis of Ti(CH2CMe3)4 in solution have been carried out in parallel with studies of the chemical mechanism responsible for its conversion to titanium carbide under CVD conditions. In hydrocarbon solutions, the neopentyl complex thermolyzes to eliminate 2.1 equiv of neopentane as the principal organic product. A deuterium kinetic isotope effect (k\xce\xb1(H)/k\xce\xb1(D) = 5.2 \xc2\xb1 0.4) upon deuterating the alkyl groups at the \xce\xb1 positions provides clear evidence that the initial step in the thermolysis is an \xce\xb1-hydrogen abstraction reaction to form neopentane. The activation parameters for this \xce\xb1-hydrogen abstraction process are \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 21.5 \xc2\xb1 1.4 kcal/mol and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9216.6 \xc2\xb1 3.8 cal/(mol K). The titanium-containing product of this reaction is a titanium alkylidene, which in solution activates C\xe2\x88\x92H bonds of both saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon solvents such as benzene and cyclohexane. No activation of the C\xe2\x88\x92F bonds of hexafluorobenzene is seen, however. Under special circumstances, a second thermolysis pathway for TiNp4 can be detected, \xce\xb3-hydrogen activation, but this pathway is intrinsically about 25 times slower than the \xce\xb1-hydrogen abstraction process. "
"The chemical pathway responsible for the conversion of the organotitanium compound tetraneopentyltitanium to titanium carbide has been studied under chemical vapor conditions and on single crystals in ultra-high vacuum. For every equivalent of TiNp4 consumed in the deposition process, 3.28 equiv of neopentane and 0.16 equiv of isobutane are produced; other organic species are also formed but in relatively small amounts. About 93% of the carbon and hydrogen originally present in the precursor can be accounted for in these products. Thermolysis of the specifically deuterated analogue Ti(CD2CMe3)4 yields a 2.25:1 ratio of neopentane-d3 and neopentane-d2; this result combined with a kinetic isotope effect of 4.9 at 385 K shows unequivocally that the first step in the deposition pathway under CVD conditions is \xce\xb1-hydrogen abstraction. The \xce\xb1-hydrogen abstraction step produces 1 equiv of neopentane and a titanium alkylidene, which undergoes further \xce\xb1- (and eventually \xce\xb3-) hydrogen activation processes to generate the second and third equivalents of neopentane. In the last stages of the thermolysis sequence, neopentyl (or neopentyl-derived) organic groups evidently fragment and generate the carbon atoms that eventually form the titanium carbide phase. Spectroscopic studies with IR and HREELS techniques have also been carried out in order to provide additional evidence about the nature of the species present when single crystal surfaces dosed with TiNp4 are heated. A band at 1121 cm-1 is tentatively ascribed to the \xce\xbd(MC) band of surface-bound neopentylidene groups. "
"Positively charged polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, P, was found to bind strongly to the surface of anionic montmorrillonite, M, platelets in aqueous dispersions up to a saturation (estimated to correspond to the binding of five P to one 1.0 nm \xc3\x97 200 nm M platelet) beyond which reversible physisorption occurred. Immersion of a substrate (glass, quartz, silica-wafer, gold, silver, and even Teflon) into an aqueous 1% solution of P and rinsing with ultrapure water for 10 min resulted in the strong adsorption of a 1.6 nm thick P on the substrate. Immersion of the P coated substrate into an aqueous dispersion of M and rinsing with ultrapure water for 10 min led to the adsorption of 2.5 nm thick M. Repeating the self-assembly steps of P and M for n number of times produced (P/M)n self-assembled films. Thickness of the M layer was found to depend on the external voltage applied during its self-assembly:\xe2\x80\x89 applying a positive potential during the self-assembly of M increased the thickness of the M layer; application of a small negative potential decreased it slightly; however, larger negative voltages augmented it. The structure of self-assembled (P/M)n films have been characterized by a variety of techniques:\xe2\x80\x89 X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopic, and surface plasmon spectroscopic measurements. It was shown that clay platelets form stacks upon adsorption to the polymer layer consisting on the average two aluminosilicate sheets. The evolution of the surface roughness upon sequential deposition of P/M layers was observed by in situ AFM. Large etched pits, up to 700 nm diameter and 30 nm depth, were smoothed during P/M deposition. Small pits (188 nm diameter and 14 nm deep) were capped after one P/M deposition cycle. Surface roughness of (P/M)n films was estimated by a number of methods including surface plasmon spectroscopy. The overall roughness did not appear to correlate with the type of substrate used. On the other hand, application of an external electric field during the self-assembly of P strongly influenced the surface morphology. Application of a negative potential during the self-assembly of P improved the uniformity and regularity of the deposited layers. "
"A combined experimental/computational study has been carried out on the effect of hydrogen bond complex formation between the radical anion of naphthalimide and the acylated diaminopyridine receptor 2. Experimental hyperfine coupling constants (hfc\'s) were obtained via simultaneous electrochemistry and EPR (SEEPR). An overall increase in the absolute values of the hfc\'s is observed. To better correlate experimental results with changes in electronic structure, hfc\'s were calculated using UHF and UKS wave functions, specifically the B3LYP hybrid functional. While the UHF derived hfc\'s reproduce qualitative trends, the hfc\'s obtained by density functional calculations are in good quantitative agreement with the experimental data. B3LYP calculations show an increase in spin polarization, with the largest effect observed in the naphthyl moiety, consistent with experimental results. "
"Using 207Pb magic angle spinning and static NMR, we have resolved and assigned different lead sites in crystalline lead oxides and lead silicates to their isotropic chemical shifts. Chemical shift anisotropies were also obtained for lead sites from the intensities of spinning sidebands. Empirical correlations between 207Pb isotropic chemical shifts and structural parameters are proposed. For ionic compounds, we show good correlations between chemical shift and coordination number or mean bond length. For more covalent compounds, the best empirical correlation has been obtained by using the degree of oxygen s\xe2\x88\x92p hybridization and second neighbor electronegativity similar to that previously used to characterize 29Si shifts in aluminosilicates. The Pb2+ chemical shift anisotropies increase with more positive chemical shifts. These correlations, established for simple crystalline compounds, should allow better characterization of lead environments in disordered materials of complex composition. "
"Exchange rates of rapidly exchanging (>1.0 s-1) backbone amide protons with solvent water in staphylococcal nuclease (SN) were measured at pH 6.03\xe2\x88\x927.03 with a 2D heteronuclear water exchange filter sequence (WEX II-FHSQC). Comparison of the exchange data with crystal structure data reveals the following:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) Non-hydrogen-bonding and exposed residues have protection factors (predicted exchange rate in random coil/measured exchange rate) of less than 15 for non-hydrophobic residues and 10 or higher for hydrophobic residues. Among non-hydrophobic residues, Gly tends to have a higher protection factor (10\xe2\x88\x9215), whereas other residues are below 10. (2) Protection factors for buried and non-hydrogen-bonded protons vary over a wide range (6\xe2\x88\x92104). Low protection factors (<25) may indicate fluctuations in structure resulting in substantial solvent exposure. (3) Some hydrogen-bonded and buried protons show rapid exchange, and the protection factors are 25\xe2\x88\x92400. This indicates kinetically labile hydrogen bonds and solvent exposure by structural fluctuations. On the other hand, many protons in this category exchange slower than the detection limit (<1.0 s-1) and are mainly observed in \xce\xb1 helices and \xce\xb2 sheets, or hydrophobic residues. Although a good correlation between NMR exchange measurements and X-ray structural properties was observed, discrepancies were also found for several residues, namely 80Gln, 82Thr, and 138Asn. The measured pH dependence revealed unusual behavior for 77Asn, possibly due to a tightly bound water molecule. Our data indicate that it is possible to use the exchange rates of rapidly exchanging protons as a probe for studying hydrogen bonding, solvent accessibility, or regional kinetic lability of protein structures in solution at physiological pH.

"A solid-state NMR method (double-quantum heteronuclear local field NMR) is applied to a 13C2 labeled sample of the 41 kD integral membrane protein rhodopsin. The technique operates under magic-angle-spinning conditions, with good sensitivity and resolution, and allows a direct determination of molecular torsional angles, without estimating internuclear distances. In rhodopsin, we determine the H\xe2\x88\x92C10\xe2\x88\x92C11\xe2\x88\x92H torsional angle of the retinylidene chromophore to be 160 \xc2\xb1 10\xc2\xb0, indicating a significant deviation from the planar 10-11-s-trans conformation. Double-quantum heteronuclear local field NMR is shown to be a feasible method for the accurate determination of local molecular conformation in large molecular systems which are unsuitable for crystallography.

"An experiment is described that produces multiple-quantum magic angle spinning (MQMAS) NMR spectrum of 27Al via 1H cross polarization (CP). An application of this new technique to the study of a fully hydrated AlPO4-11 aluminophosphate is presented. It is shown that a combination of MQMAS and CPMQMAS provides new insight into the structure of this sample. While MQMAS alone can be used to obtain high-resolution spectra and quantitative information on the distribution of Al sites, CPMQMAS allows one to establish the positions of water molecules within the AlPO4-11 framework.

"Rate constants kESR for intramolecular electron transfer between the reduced and oxidized hydrazine units of dimeric 2-tert-butyl-3\xe2\x88\x92isopropyl-2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octylhydrazine radical cations which are doubly linked through the bicyclic units by four \xcf\x83-bonds (aBIT+, sBIT+, and aBIH+) were determined by simulations of their variable temperature ESR spectra in methylene chloride to be 10.5(7), 9.6(3), and 12.4(4) \xc3\x97 107 s-1 at 298 K, respectively. These cations show solvent sensitive charge transfer absorption bands from which the vertical electron transfer excitation energy, \xce\xbb, and the electronic coupling, VJ, were determined by simulation of the charge transfer bands using vibronic coupling theory (ref 13). Partitioning between solvent and vibrational components of \xce\xbb was made assuming that the average energy of the vibrational modes coupled to the electron transfer, h\xce\xbdv, is 2.29 kcal/mol (800 cm-1). The ESR rate constants at 298 K for s- and aBIT+ are factors of 23 and 26, respectively, larger than kcal, calculated from \xce\xbbs, \xce\xbbv, h\xce\xbdv, and VJ estimated using a vibronic coupling theory analysis of the charge transfer bands. The ratio kcal(350)/kcal(250) is 7.4 and 9.4(kESR(350)/kESR(250)) for sBIT+ and aBIT+, respectively. Previously reported data for the doubly-linked four \xcf\x83-bond dimeric N,N\xe2\x80\x98-bis-2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octyl hydrazine (22H+) was also reanalyzed using vibronic coupling theory. kESR/kcal in acetonitrile at 298 K is 20, but kcal(350)/kcal(250) is 25(kESR(350)/kESR(250)). Possible reasons for the rather poor agreement with theory are suggested. "
"Rate constants kESR for intramolecular electron transfer between the reduced and oxidized diazene units of dimeric 2-tert-butyl-2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octyldiazenium radical cations cations which are doubly linked through the bicyclic units by six \xcf\x83-bonds, sB6\xcf\x83+ and aB6\xcf\x83+, were determined from their variable temperature ESR spectra in CH3CN, dimethylformamide, and CH2Cl2. These cations show solvent\xe2\x88\x92sensitive charge transfer absorption bands from which the vertical electron transfer excitation energy, \xce\xbb, and the electronic coupling, VJ, were determined by simulation, using vibronic coupling theory. The partitioning between solvent and vibrational components of \xce\xbb were made assuming that the average energy of the vibrational modes coupled to the electron transfer, h\xce\xbdv, is 3.15 kcal/mol (1100 cm-1). The observed rate constants interpolated to 298 K are factors of 4.7\xe2\x88\x925.8 larger than those calculated from the electron transfer parameters obtained from vibronic coupling theory analysis of the charge transfer bands, kcal, in acetonitrile and DMF, and for sB6\xcf\x83+ in CH2Cl2 the factor is 2.5. The ratios kESR(350)/kESR(250) are 1.0\xe2\x88\x921.6 times larger than kcal(350)/kcal(250)in CH3CN and DMF and 0.9 times larger in CH2Cl2. The agreement with theory for the bis-diazeniums is far better than that obtained for doubly four \xcf\x83-bond-linked bis-hydrazine radical cations (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, XXXX). It is suggested that the significantly smaller vibronic coupling constants S = \xce\xbbv/h\xce\xbdv for the bis-diazeniums (6.5\xe2\x88\x927.6) compared to those of the bis-hydrazines (13.6\xe2\x88\x9217.5) might be principally responsible for the difference in agreement of theory with experiment.

"2-Azidoacetic acid (N3CH2CO2H) has been synthesized and characterized by a variety of spectroscopic techniques, and the thermal decomposition of this molecule studied by matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy and real-time ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. The results are consistent with the vapor phase thermal decomposition following a pathway involving concerted ejection of molecular N2 and the simultaneous formation of CO2 and methanimine (CH2NH). No evidence was found for the presence of intermediates such as the nitrene NCH2CO2H or the imine HNCHCO2H. At higher temperatures, CH2NH further decomposes to give HCN and H2. "
"The detection of oligonucleotides hybridized to a planar, plastic substrate using matrix-assisted laser-desorption time-of-flight mass spectroscopy is reported. Oligonucleotides of length 18 to 29 bases were hybridized to a plastic surface upon which a monolayer of an oligonucleotide of sequence 5\xe2\x80\x98-TCC TCT CTC CGT CAT GCG TAT CGT TCA AT-3\xe2\x80\x98 was tethered at the 3\xe2\x80\x98 end. The target oligonucleotides were hybridized from dilute aqueous solution. The system was prepared for laser desorption by using the matrix 3-hydroxypicolinic acid, deposited at 45 \xc2\xb0C. The subsequent mass spectra revealed parent molecular ion for the target DNA with low-level dimerization and no discernible fragmentation. "
"The minimum energy path for photoisomerization of the minimal retinal protonated Shiff base model tZt-penta-3,5-dieniminium cation (cis-C5H6NH2+) is computed using MC\xe2\x88\x92SCF and multireference M\xc3\xb8ller\xe2\x88\x92Plesset methods. The results show that, upon excitation to the spectroscopic state, this molecule undergoes a barrierless relaxation toward a configuration where the excited and ground states are conically intersecting. The intersection point has a \xe2\x88\xbc80\xc2\xb0 twisted central double bond which provides a route for fully efficient nonadiabatic cis \xe2\x86\x92 trans isomerization. This mechanism suggests that cis-C5H6NH2+ provides a suitable \xe2\x80\x9cab initio\xe2\x80\x9d model for rationalizing the observed \xe2\x80\x9cultrafast\xe2\x80\x9d (sub-picosecond) isomerization dynamics of the retinal chromophore in rhodopsin. The detailed analysis of the computed reaction coordinate provides information on the changes in molecular structure and charge distribution along the isomerization path. It is shown that the initial excited state motion is dominated by stretching modes which result in an elongation of the central double bond of the molecule associated with the change in bond order in the excited state. Thus, the actual cis \xe2\x86\x92 trans isomerization motion is induced only after the bond stretching has been completed. It is also demonstrated that, along the excited state isomerization coordinate, the positive charge is progressively transferred from the -CHCHNH2 to the CH2CHCH- molecular fragment. Thus, at the intersection point, the charge is completely localized on the CH2CHCH- fragment. This result suggests that strategically placed counterions can greatly affect the rate, specificity, and quantum yield of the photoisomerization. "
"The transition structures for the ene reactions of cyclopropene with ethylene, propene, and cyclopropene have been located with ab initio molecular orbital calculations and the 6-31G* basis set and by DFT calculations with the Becke3LYP functional and the 6-31G* basis set. Several of the transition structures have also been located with CASSCF calculations. Energies of all stationary points were also evaluated with second-order M\xc3\xb8ller\xe2\x88\x92Plesset theory using the RHF/6-31G* optimized geometry. The geometries of each transition structure and the energetics of each reaction are discussed and compared to the ene reaction of propene with ethylene. Calculations show that the cyclopropene ene reactions have much lower activation barriers than the propene\xe2\x88\x92ethylene ene reaction, in agreement with experimental results. The transition structures have varying degrees of asynchronicity. The stabilities of the possible radical intermediates for each reaction are reflected in the geometries of the transition structures. The relief of strain in a cyclopropene, when acting as the enophile, accounts for the energetic differences in these reactions. The endo transition structure for the dimerization is lower in energy than the exo transition structure by 2.7 kcal/mol at the Becke3LYP/6-31G* + ZPE level of theory. Secondary orbital overlap of a CH bond of the enophile with the \xcf\x80-system at the central carbon of the ene is proposed to account for the preference for the endo transition structure. Barely stable diradical intermediates have been found for both endo and exo cyclopropene dimerization reactions, but it is likely that they are artifacts of the current level of theory. "
"A series of calix[6]arene-based surfactants have been synthesized, which contain amide oxime head groups on their upper rim and 5,5-dimethylhexyl (I), n-octyl (II), n-dodecyl (III), and n-hexadecyl (IV) groups on their lower rim. Composite membranes that were fabricated from Langmuir\xe2\x88\x92Blodgett (LB) multilayers derived from each surfactant plus poly[1-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propyne] (PTMSP) cast film showed a significant increase in their selectivity toward helium and nitrogen, relative to bare PTMSP. In sharp contrast, analogous composites that were prepared with LB multilayers of conventional single chain surfactants [arachidic acid (AA), cadmium arachidate (AA/Cd2+), and stearoamideoxime (SA)] exhibited permeation properties that were identical with those of bare PTMSP. When a polymeric surfactant [poly(1-octadecene-co-maleic anhydride), POM] was used for LB film construction, a modest increase in selectivity was observed. These findings, together with an analysis of representative composites by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, provide compelling evidence for the presence of intact, calix[6]arene-based LB assemblies on the surface of PTMSP; with the conventional single chain surfactants, however, disassembly and absorption into the bulk phase of the support is favored. The results of this study highlight the need for having individual surfactant molecules span individual pores on the surface of the support and strong intermolecular forces between neighboring surfactants to produce relatively defect-free LB films.

"Eight-ring hairpin polyamides which differ only by the linear arrangement of pyrrole (Py) and imidazole (Im) amino acids were designed for recognition of six base pair DNA sequences containing four contiguous G,C base pairs. The respective DNA binding properties of three polyamides, ImImPyPy-\xce\xb3-ImImPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp, ImPyImPy-\xce\xb3-ImPyImPy-\xce\xb2-Dp, and ImImImIm-\xce\xb3-PyPyPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp, were analyzed by footprinting and affinity cleavage on a DNA fragment containing the respective match sites 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGGCCA-3\xe2\x80\x98, 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGCGCA-3\xe2\x80\x98, and 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGGGGA-3\xe2\x80\x98. Quantitative footprint titrations demonstrate that ImImPyPy-\xce\xb3-ImImPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp binds the designed match site 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGGCCA-3\xe2\x80\x98 with an equilibrium association constant of Ka = 1 \xc3\x97 1010 M-1 and >250-fold specificity versus the mismatch sequences, 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGCGCA-3\xe2\x80\x98 and 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGGGGA-3\xe2\x80\x98. The polyamides ImPyImPy-\xce\xb3-ImPyImPy-\xce\xb2-Dp and ImImImIm-\xce\xb3-PyPyPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp recognize their respective 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGCGCA-3\xe2\x80\x98 and 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGGGGA-3\xe2\x80\x98 match sites with reduced affinity relative to ImImPyPy-\xce\xb3-ImImPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp, but again with high specificity with regard to mismatch sites. These results expand the DNA sequence repertoire targeted by pyrrole-imidazole polyamides and identify sequence composition effects which will guide further second-generation polyamide design for DNA recognition.

"The solid-state conformation of the cyclic decapeptide phakellistatin 8, cyclo[Pro1-Pro2-Ile3-Phe4-Val5-Leu6-Pro7-Pro8-Tyr9-Ile10] has been determined by X-ray methods. [Crystal data:\xe2\x80\x89 orthorhombic; P21212; a = 20.294(2), b = 24.141(6), c = 13.903(3) \xc3\x85. Least-squares refinement of 10061 reflections (I >2\xcf\x83(I)) led to residuals R1 = 0.0651 (Sheldrick wR2 = 0.1749).] The cyclic decapeptide includes (1) a 5\xe2\x86\x921 transannular \xce\xb1-turn type H-bond, encompassing the Pro1, Pro2, and Ile3 residues and involving the Phe4 amide hydrogen and the Ile10 carbonyl, (2) an intramolecular 3\xe2\x86\x921 type VIa \xce\xb3-turn type of H-bond, encompassing the Phe4 residue and involving the Val5 amide hydrogen and the Ile3 carbonyl, and (3) an intramolecular 4\xe2\x86\x921 type VIa \xce\xb2-turn H-bond, encompassing the Pro7 and Pro8 residues and involving the Tyr9 amide hydrogen and the Leu6 carbonyl. All backbone dihedral angles fall within normal, low-energy regions except for two amino acid residues, Phe4 (\xce\xa6, \xce\xa8 = 71\xc2\xb0, \xe2\x88\x9241\xc2\xb0) and Tyr9 (\xce\xa6, \xce\xa8 = 75\xc2\xb0, 31\xc2\xb0), the side chains of which are found to fold back over the peptide backbone. Conformations of the four proline residues for phakellistatin 8 can be classified as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 Pro1 Cs-C\xce\xb3exo, Pro2 C2-C\xce\xb2exo(C\xce\xb3endo), Pro7 Cs-C\xce\xb3endo and Pro8 C2-C\xce\xb2exo(C\xce\xb3endo). Examination of phakellistatin 8 and the decapeptide antamanide show the two compounds are quite similar, both in overall backbone conformation, proline ring conformations, and the presence of nearly identical \xce\xb1-turns involving one of the Pro-Pro pairs. Both molecules are highly hydrated when crystallized from aqueous solvents and both exhibit channel formation in the solid state. "
"Galabiose (Gal\xce\xb11-4Gal) derivatives were coupled to carrier molecules having mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrameric functionalities, thus creating mono- to tetravalent dendritic galabiosides (1\xe2\x88\x929). The di- to tetravalent galabiosides were several hundred times more efficient than the monomeric galabiosides in inhibiting hemagglutination by the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus suis, resulting in complete inhibition at low nanomolar concentrations. This is unprecedented in the field of inhibition of bacterial adhesion by soluble compounds. "
"Kinetic isotope effects were measured for the acyl transfer reaction from p-nitrophenyl acetate to hydroxylamine at pH 6.0 and 12.0. The isotope effects measured and their values at pH 6.0 and 12.0, respectively, are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 leaving group oxygen-18 isotope effect, 1.0310 and 1.0074; the carbonyl oxygen-18 isotope effect, 1.0082 and 1.0008; the \xce\xb2-deuterium isotope effect, 0.9644 and 0.9516; the carbonyl carbon-13 isotope effect, 1.0287 and 1.0337; the nitro group nitrogen-15 isotope effect, 1.0009 and 1.0011. The solvent deuterium isotope effect is 1.4 at pH 7.5 and 0.85 at pH 12.0. The leaving group oxygen-18 isotope effect was measured as a function of pH between 6.0 and 12.0 and was found to have an inflection at pH 10.0 between the plateau regions at high and low pH. The results are consistent with rate limiting breakdown of an intermediate for the low pH reaction and attack of hydroxylamine anion with concerted expulsion of nitrophenolate ion at high pH. "
"Treatment of N-(2- or 3-alkynyl)amino esters with a low-valent titanium reagent diisopropoxy(\xce\xb72-propene)titanium (1), generated in situ by the reaction of Ti(O-i-Pr)4 and 2i-PrMgCl, resulted in an intramolecular nucleophilic acyl substitution (INAS) reaction to afford \xce\xb1-alkylidene-pyrrolidinones or -piperidinones. Thus, treatment of N-propargyl-anthranilates 5, -indole-2-carboxylates 10, or -pyrrole-2-carboxylates 13 with 1 gave 4-quinolones 7, [1,2-a]indoles, or [1,2-a]pyrroles, respectively. Similarly, N-alkynylated \xce\xb1- or \xce\xb2-amino esters 14 or 15 with 1 afforded N-heterocycles 18 or 19. In the reaction of N-(2- or 3-alkenyl)amino esters with 1, the resulting INAS product underwent intramolecular carbonyl addition (ICA) reaction to afford the N-heterocyclic compounds having a cyclopropanol moiety in good to excellent yields. Thus, the treatment of N-alkenyl-anthranilate 4a, -indole-2-carboxylates 8 and 9, or -pyrrole-2-carboxylates 11 and 12 with 1 gave the corresponding quinoline derivative 6a, [1,2-a]indoles, or [1,2-a]pyrroles, respectively. The optically active N-heterocyclic compounds 20 and 21 were obtained from N-alkenylated \xce\xb1- or \xce\xb2-amino esters 16 or 17. A highly efficient total synthesis of allopumiliotoxin alkaloid 267A has also been accomplished. Thus, the N-propargyl-2[(1-hydroxy-1-methoxycarbonyl)ethyl]pyrrolidine 24 (from l-proline in six steps) reacted with 1 to afford the corresponding indolidinone 25 in 67% yield, which has previously been converted to allopumiliotoxin 267A.

"Poly(n-hexyl isocyanate) adopts a helical structure in solution and the preference of one helical sense induced by a nonracemic chiral solvent can be detected by the circular dichroism (CD) of the backbone chromophore of the polymer. Addition of an achiral or racemic cosolvent leads to a reduction of the CD intensity, which can be interpreted quantitatively as reflecting the composition of the solvent mixture in contact with the helical backbone of the polymer. Equilibrium constants characterizing the relation between the solvent composition in contact with the polymer and the bulk of the system are given for mixtures of (S)-1-chloro-2-methylbutane and a number of achiral or racemic cosolvents. The relationship between the structure of the cosolvent and the extent of the preferential solvation was surprising in several instances. The polymer was preferentially solvated by a highly branched hydrocarbon although it was a precipitant and the preferential solvation by alcohols extended up to the point of polymer precipitation. This unusual method for characterizing preferential solvation of this rod-like polymer is compared with other methods used previously on flexible chain macromolecules. "
"As part of a project aimed at developing models for photosystem II (PSII) in green plants, we have prepared a series of model compounds (7, 8, and 13). In these compounds, a photosensitizer, ruthenium(II) tris(bipyridyl) complex (to mimic the function of P680 in PSII), was covalently linked to a manganese(II) ion through different bridging ligands. The structures of the compounds were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The interaction between the ruthenium and manganese moieties within the complex was probed by steady-state and time-resolved emission measurements. When the binuclear complexes are exposed to flash photolysis in the presence of an electron acceptor such as methylviologen (MV2+), it could be shown that after the initial electron transfer from the excited state of Ru(II) in compound 7, forming Ru(III) and MV+\xe2\x80\xa2, an intramolecular electron transfer from coordinated Mn(II) to the photogenerated Ru(III) occurred with a first-order rate constant of 1.8 \xc3\x97 105 s-1, regenerating Ru(II). This is believed to be the first supramolecular system where a manganese complex has been used as an electron donor to a photo-oxidized photosensitizer. Possible extensions to develop the manganese donor, and thus to approach the function of reaction center in PSII, are indicated. "
"The potential biological activity of vanadium analogs of AMP, ADP, ATP, 2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-cAMP, and 3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-cAMP stimulated the full speciation study of the vanadate\xe2\x88\x92adenosine(AdH) and vanadate\xe2\x88\x92adenosine\xe2\x88\x92imidazole(ImH) systems in aqueous solution, using a combination of potentiometry (glass electrode) and 51V NMR spectroscopy. The study of the H+\xe2\x88\x92H2VO4-\xe2\x88\x92AdH\xe2\x88\x92ImH system was performed in 0.600 M Na(Cl) medium at 25 oC in the pH range 2\xe2\x88\x9211. In the vanadate\xe2\x88\x92adenosine system V2Ad22- and a new complex, V2Ad2-, with log \xce\xb2 = 7.68 \xc2\xb1 0.01 and 11.89 \xc2\xb1 0.08, respectively (pKa = 4.21), explained all experimental observations. Although the V2Ad2--type complex has previously been reported in the vanadate\xe2\x88\x92AMP system, the existence of such a complex in a vanadate\xe2\x88\x92nucleoside system was not previously appreciated. In the vanadate\xe2\x88\x92adenosine\xe2\x88\x92imidazole system a ternary mixed ligand complex, VAdIm-, forms in addition to the V2Ad22- and V2Ad2- species. It exists between pH 5.5 and 11 and has a formation constant log \xce\xb2 = 3.04 \xc2\xb1 0.02. This is the first ternary complex of this type that has been characterized in a qualitative (stoichiometry) and quantitative (formation constant) manner. Although the complex is fairly weak and requires a large excess of imidazole to form, it is significantly more stable than the 1:1 complexes that previously have been reported to form between vanadate and adenosine. Above all, it is much more stable than the complexes that eventually form between vanadate and imidazole. The possibilities that intramolecular imidazole stacking and/or intermolecular hydrogen bonding explain the enhanced stability in the ternary complex are discussed. Furthermore, the action of various vanadium\xe2\x88\x92adenosine derivatives and the potential role of vanadate\xe2\x88\x92adenosine\xe2\x88\x92imidazole complexes in biological systems is evaluated.

"The first time-resolved infrared difference spectra for metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states in the fingerprint region from 1400 to 1625 cm-1 are reported for [Ru(bpy)3]2+* and [Re(bpy)(CO)3(4-Etpy)]+* in CD3CN at 298 K (bpy is 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine; 4-Etpy is 4-ethylpyridine). The spectra are assigned by comparison to ground-state spectra and electrochemically generated [RuIII(bpy)3]3+ and [RuII(bpy\xe2\x80\xa2-)(bpy)2]+. The data provide clear evidence for the localized description [RuIII(bpy\xe2\x80\xa2-)(bpy)2]2+* on the \xe2\x88\xbc100 ns time scale. They also give insight into electronic distribution in the excited state based on the magnitudes and directions of the infrared shifts. "
"The synthesis of epitaxially grown, wurtzite CdSe/CdS core/shell nanocrystals is reported. Shells of up to three monolayers in thickness were grown on cores ranging in diameter from 23 to 39 \xc3\x85. Shell growth was controllable to within a tenth of a monolayer and was consistently accompanied by a red shift of the absorption spectrum, an increase of the room temperature photoluminescence quantum yield (up to at least 50%), and an increase in the photostability. Shell growth was shown to be uniform and epitaxial by the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and optical spectroscopy. The experimental results indicate that in the excited state the hole is confined to the core and the electron is delocalized throughout the entire structure. The photostability can be explained by the confinement of the hole, while the delocalization of the electron results in a degree of electronic accessibility that makes these nanocrystals attractive for use in optoelectronic devices. "
"The present study explores the nature and reactivity of iron- and zinc-containing species generated in hydrocarbon-oxidizing GifIV-type solutions (Fe catalyst/Zn/O2 in pyridine/acetic acid (10:1 v/v). The ultimate goal of this investigation is to unravel the role of metal sites in mediating dioxygen-dependent C\xe2\x88\x92H activation, which in the case of Gif chemistry demonstrates an enhanced selectivity for the ketonization of secondary carbons. Reaction of [Fe3O(O2CCH3)6(py)3]\xc2\xb7py (1) with zinc powder in CH3CN/CH3COOH or CH2Cl2/CH3COOH affords the trinuclear compound [Zn2FeII(O2CCH3)6(py)2] (2). Single-crystal X-ray analysis confirms that one monodentate and two bidentate acetate groups bridge adjacent pairs of metals with the iron atom occupying a centrosymmetric position. The analogous reduction of 1 in py/CH3COOH (10:1, 5:1, 2:1 v/v) yields [FeII(O2CCH3)2(py)4] (3), [FeII2(O2CCH3)4(py)3]n (4), and [Zn(O2CCH3)2(py)2] (5) depending on the isolation procedure employed. Compound 3 possesses a distorted octahedral geometry, featuring a C2 axis bisecting the equatorial, pyridine-occupied plane, whereas the two acetate groups reside along the perpendicular axis. Compound 4 is a one-dimensional solid constructed by asymmetric diferrous units. Two bidentate and one monodentate acetate groups bridge the two iron sites, with the monodentate bridge also acting as a chelator to one ferrous center. The two iron centers exhibit weak antiferromagnetic coupling. Compounds 3 and 4 are also accessible from the reduction of 1 with iron powder or treatment with H2/Pd. Solutions of 3 and 4 in pyridine or py/CH3COOH react with pure dioxygen or air to eventually regenerate 1 in a concentration-dependent manner. Oxidation of 2 in py/CH3COOH with pure dioxygen or air yields [Fe2.22(2)Zn0.78(2)O(O2CCH3)6(py)3]\xc2\xb7py (1\xe2\x80\x98) and [Zn2(O2CCH3)4(py)2] (6). Compound 1\xe2\x80\x98 is isostructural to 1, exhibiting rhombohedral symmetry at 223 K. The filtrate of the reduction of 1 with zinc in neat pyridine, when exposed to dioxygen, affords dichroic red\xe2\x88\x92green crystals of monoclinic [Fe2ZnO(O2CCH3)6(py)3]\xc2\xb7py (1\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98). Species 1\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 yields products identical with those provided by 1 under reducing conditions. Compounds 2\xe2\x88\x926 are related by pyridine-dependent equilibria, as demonstrated by mutual interconversions and electronic absorption data in pyridine and py/CH3COOH solutions. In non-pyridine solutions, Zn-containing species 5 and 6 rearrange to the crystallographically characterized species [Zn(O2CCH3)2(py)]n (7) and [Zn3(O2CCH3)6(py)2] (8). Compound 7 is a one-dimensional solid featuring a chain of Zn sites linked by a bidentate acetate group while additionally coordinated by a chelating acetate. Compound 8 is isostructural to 2. Further perturbations of the described structures are apparent in ionic iron-containing species, such as the pseudo-seven-coordinate iron in [Ph3PNPPh3][FeII(O2CCH3)3(py)] (9), which is obtained from the reaction of 3 with [PPN][O2CCH3], and the water-coordinated iron in [FeII(H2O)4(trans-py)2][O2CCH3]2 (10), which reveals an extensive two-dimensional network of hydrogen-bonding interactions. The pyridine-free species [FeII3(O2CCH3)6(OS(CD3)2)2]n (11) is isolable upon extensive incubation of 3 in (CD3)2SO. Compound 11 exhibits a remarkable one-dimensional structure, featuring four different types of acetate groups. Catalytic oxidations of adamantane, isopentane, benzene, toluene, cis-stilbene, and pyridine mediated by the system 1 (or 2\xe2\x88\x924)/Zn/O2 in py/AcOH (10:1) afford product profiles which are not fully compatible with the reported outcome of analogous oxidations by hydroxyl radicals or biologically relevant high-valent iron\xe2\x88\x92oxo species alone. The intermolecular deuterium kinetic isotope effect for the oxidation of adamantane to adamantanone is small (kH/kD = 2.01(12)) by comparison to values obtained for oxidation of hydrocarbons by biological oxygenases. Employment of hydrogen peroxide, t-BuOOH, or peracetic acid as potential oxo donors does not provide viable shunt pathways in the catalytic oxygenation of adamantane. The nature of active oxidant in GifIV-type oxidation is discussed in light of these structural and functional findings. "
"Orbital effects ascribed to \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x83\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 through-bond coupling are the result primarily of destabilizing filled\xe2\x88\x92filled interactions; little to no mixing occurs between the antisymmetric \xcf\x80 combination and \xcf\x83*. The magnitude of through-bond coupling does not correlate with bond lengthening. Previous conclusions that through-bond coupling induces long bonds relied in some cases on poor X-ray data and/or inappropriate molecular orbital theories to deduce geometries. Comparison of semiempirical and empirical force field data as a test for through-bond coupling is unwarranted. Standard force fields underestimate the steric bulk of the benzene face, but addition of so-called \xe2\x80\x9cthrough-bond coupling\xe2\x80\x9d terms does not provide a physically significant measure of through-bond coupling.

"Rate coefficients and product distributions have been measured for the gas-phase reactions of C60\xe2\x80\xa2+, C602+, and C60\xe2\x80\xa23+ with nitromethane and methyl nitrite which show a strong dependence of reactivity on the charge state of the fullerene cation and on the nature of the neutral reactant isomer. Furthermore, sequential bimolecular methoxy-radical transfer reactions were observed with methyl nitrite leading to the polymethoxylation of C602+ with up to 12 methoxy groups, far more than the number of charges on the C60 surface. Unusual periodicities were seen in the reaction kinetics, and these are correlated with the radical and aromatic character of the derivatized C60(OCH3)n2+ cations. The measurements were performed in helium buffer gas at 0.35 \xc2\xb1 0.01 Torr and 294 \xc2\xb1 3 K with use of the Selected-Ion Flow Tube (SIFT) technique. Multicollision induced dissociation experiments with the derivatized C60(OCH3)n2+ (n = 1\xe2\x88\x924) cations indicated sequential loss of single methoxy radicals, which is consistent with direct bonding of the methoxy groups to the C60 cage. Polymethoxylation was not observed with C60\xe2\x80\xa23+. Instead, C60\xe2\x80\xa23+ reacts with methyl nitrite by dissociative electron transfer. C602+ is unreactive with nitromethane, but C60\xe2\x80\xa23+ adds one molecule and the C60(CH3NO2)\xe2\x80\xa23+ adduct ion reacts further only by proton transfer. C60\xe2\x80\xa2+ is unreactive with both nitromethane and methyl nitrite. "
"Mid-IR vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) and the corresponding Raman optical activity (ROA) spectra of 1-amino-2-propanol and 2-amino-1-propanol in neat solution are compared to yield insight into the dominant structural sensitivity of each technique. The ROA spectra for these isomeric compounds are quite similar while their VCD spectra are substantially different. The contrast between the results with these two techniques can be empirically interpreted to imply that VCD is more sensitive to the overall chirality of a molecule, conformation plus configuration, while ROA is more dependent on the nature of the local environment, or the configuration, of the functional groups. This observation would correlate with VCD having a significant dipolar coupling contribution that is highly dependent on conformation. This distinction between VCD and ROA sensitivities would be expected to be most appropriate for high dipole strength transitions in conformationally unconstrained, open-chain molecules. These observations directly reflect the contrast between current applications of VCD and ROA to biomolecular conformational analyses. "
"The mechanism of action of the enzyme diol dehydrase has variously been suggested to involve a radical, a protonated radical (radical cation), or a carbocation in the apparent transfer of HO from one carbon atom to the other to give acetaldehyde and water. This adenosylcobalamin-requiring B12 enzyme catalyzes dehydration of 1,2-dihydroxyethane. Its active site is buried within a hydrophobic cavity. Each of the three possibilities are examined by ab initio molecular orbital calculations. Total molecular energies have been calculated with full geometry optimization at the MP2(FC)/6-31G* level and, in addition, single point energies using the MP2(FC)/6-311++G** basis set. Vibrational frequencies were also calculated. Transfer of an HO group within a HOCH\xe2\x88\x92CH2OH\xe2\x8e\xa4\xe2\x80\xa2 radical (postulated to be formed by the initial reaction of the diol with the deoxyadenosyl radical via a bridge structure) was ruled out because the activation energy is much too high in relation to the observed rate constant for the enzyme reaction. A carbocation mechanism also presents a problem, quite apart from the necessity of postulating some acceptor for the electron from the HOCH\xe2\x88\x92CH2OH\xe2\x8e\xa4\xe2\x80\xa2 radical. In principle acetaldehyde could be formed via the 2,2-dihydroxyeth-1-yl cation which was found to undergo a spontaneous 1,2-hydride ion shift, giving protonated acetic acid. But, although the 1,2-dihydroxyethyl cation (otherwise protonated glycolaldehyde) is well established as a stable species, the intermediary bridge structure could not be found. The radical cation HOCH-CH2OH2\xe2\x8e\xa4\xe2\x80\xa2+, formed by proton transfer from an active-site group, was found to be inherently unstable, transforming without activation into a stable hydrogen-bonded hydrate of the anti-vinyl alcohol radical cation, H2O\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7HOCH\xe2\x88\x92CH2\xe2\x8e\xa4\xe2\x80\xa2+. Deprotonation and H-atom transfer (from AdCH3) were then found to give stable hydrogen-bonded hydrates of the formylmethyl radical, protonated acetaldehyde, and acetaldehyde itself. The ultimate formation of acetaldehyde and water can be attributed either to the dissociation of acetaldehyde hydrate or the prior dissociation of the formylmethyl radical hydrate followed by the H-atom transfer step. Because H2O is already formed as a discrete entity in the initial protonation step and no transfer of a bonded HO, H2O, or H2O+ group from one carbon atom to the other actually occurs, this series of reactions may be termed a \xe2\x80\x9cpredissociation\xe2\x80\x9d mechanism. The overall proton transfer and the formation of water are complicated interconnected processes. A consideration of whether or not the cobalt participates in one of the later reaction steps is underway. "
"High level ab initio and density functional theory computations have been used to assess the aromaticity and antiaromaticity of the cations and anions derived from cyclopentadiene (C5H6), indene (C9H8), and fluorene (C13H10). On the basis of the IGLO calculated magnetic susceptibility exaltations (\xce\x9btot) and the GIAO computed nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS), the cyclopentadienyl (C5H5-), indenyl (C9H7-), and fluorenyl (C13H9-) anions are, as expected, highly aromatic as compared with benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene. The aromaticity or antiaromaticity of the individual rings has been characterized by using the nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS) based on the magnetic shieldings calculated at the ring centers. In addition to NICS, the computed Li+ NMR chemical shifts, another useful aromaticity probe, provide data for the individual rings. The singlet cyclopentadienyl (C5H5+) and indenyl (C9H7+) cations are as antiaromatic as cyclobutadiene and benzocyclobutadiene. However, the fluorenyl cation (C13H9+) is non-aromatic by the calculated magnetic susceptibility exaltation, due to the essentially complete compensation of the diamagnetic and the paramagnetic character. Such compensation effects are shown directly by the geometric, energetic, and magnetic differences between the delocalized and localized systems computed by means of the orbital deletion procedure (ODP), in which the critical carbocation p orbital is \xe2\x80\x9cdeactivated\xe2\x80\x9d. This shows the delocalization energies of aromatic cations to be much larger than those of the antiaromatic cations, and the former are stabilized and the latter are destabilized relative to non-aromatic systems. In contrast to the cyclopentadienyl cation, which has a triplet ground state, the triplet indenyl and fluorenyl cations are higher in energy than their singlet states by 9.2. and 14.9 kcal/mol, respectively.

"Langmuir\xe2\x88\x92Blodgett (LB) films of a series of divalent metal octadecylphosphonates have been prepared and characterized. The films are each shown to be LB analogs of known solid-state metal phosphonates possessing 2-dimensional ionic\xe2\x88\x92covalent metal phosphonate layers. The metal phosphonate layers crystallize during the LB deposition process. Films were characterized with XPS, X-ray diffraction, ellipsometry, attenuated total reflectance FTIR, and, in the case of the manganese film, SQUID magnetometry. Octadecylphosphonate films with Mn2+, Mg2+, and Cd2+ form with the stoichiometry M(O3PC17H37)\xc2\xb7H2O and have metal phosphonate bonding consistent with the analogous M(O3PR)\xc2\xb7H2O layered solids. The Ca2+ film forms as Ca(HO3PC18H37)2, which is also a known solid-state phase. Magnetic measurements reveal that the manganese octadecylphosphonate film undergoes a magnetic ordering transition at 13.5 K resulting in a \xe2\x80\x9cweak ferromagnet\xe2\x80\x9d. The behavior is similar to that of the known layered solid-state manganese alkylphosphonates which are also \xe2\x80\x9cweak ferromagnets\xe2\x80\x9d. The magnetic ordering is antiferromagnetic where incomplete cancellation of the magnetic sublattices, due to low site symmetry, results in a spontaneous magnetization. A spin-flop transition is observed at 2.5 T in magnetization vs applied field measurements of the ordered state. The film also exhibits magnetic memory, with a small remnant magnetization and a coercive field of 20 mT at 2 K. The results demonstrate that magnetic ordering phenomena can be incorporated into LB films and that LB film methods can be used to prepare monolayer and multilayer films of known solid-state materials.

"The structural impact of photolesions on DNA was investigated by carrying out molecular dynamics simulations of the T5/T6 cis-syn dimer (A), T5/T6 6-4 adduct (B), and native decamer (C) of d(CGCATTACGC)2. For the cis-syn dimer containing decamer the simulations provided a structure very similar to that derived with experimental NOE data. Specifically, distortions of the simulated cis-syn dimer duplex (A) were primarily localized at the lesion site and had an overall bend similar to that of the refined NMR structure. For the simulated 6-4 adduct duplex (B), although there was considerable coincidence with the NMR derived structure, an intact hydrogen bond/dipole\xe2\x88\x92dipole interaction between the T6 pyrimidone carbonyl oxygen and A15/NH2 was observed, which was not found in the NMR derived structure. This hydrogen bond leads to a structure that seems to better account for some of the unusual experimental NOEs than the refined NMR structure. In addition, for the 6-4 adduct (B), the overall bend was significantly smaller than that suggested by the NMR derived structure. This difference in overall bend is presumably a result of differences in the torsion angles at the lesion site for the simulated vs the experimental structure. Overall these simulations agreed well with the features of the spectroscopically determined structures and reveal the power of molecular dynamics methods with explicit solvation and accurate representation of long-range electrostatic interactions to usefully model noncanonical forms of DNA.

"The dealumination of kaolinite by the solid/solution \xe2\x80\x9cinterfacial\xe2\x80\x9d reaction with HCl(aq) at 98 \xc2\xb0C was investigated using solid-state 1H CRAMPS and MAS 29Si NMR techniques. The single-pulse (SP)/MAS 29Si NMR spectra of kaolinite-derived solids that are 2\xe2\x88\x9283% dealuminated are observed to be dependent upon the degree of dealumination, showing three resolvable resonances at \xe2\x88\x9289, \xe2\x88\x92100, and \xe2\x88\x92109 ppm. The \xe2\x88\x9289 ppm resonance is due to silicon Q3-type Si(OSi)3(OAl2) sites in unreacted kaolinite, while the latter two resonances are assigned to new Q3-type silica\xe2\x88\x92alumina (Si\xe2\x88\x92OH+\xe2\x88\x92Al) and to Q4-type amorphous silica (Si(OSi)4) sites contained in dealuminated kaolinite solids following partial dealumination. The 1H CRAMPS spectra of these dealuminated solids are also dependent upon the degree of removal of Al3+ ions from the kaolinite Al\xe2\x88\x92OH\xe2\x88\x92Al layer. In addition to a broad proton peak at 4.0 ppm due to structural protons of the intact Al\xe2\x88\x92OH\xe2\x88\x92Al layer in unreacted kaolinite, two new resonances at 0.4 and 7.0 ppm are assigned to protons of the new silanol (Si\xe2\x88\x92OH) and alumina\xe2\x88\x92silica (Si\xe2\x88\x92OH+\xe2\x88\x92Al) sites. The spectral intensities of the SP/MAS 29Si and 1H CRAMPS NMR results are correlated with the progress of dealumination, permitting the development of a structural model for partially dealuminated kaolinite. This structural model is consistent with a kinetic model involving a chemically-controlled \xe2\x80\x9cheterogeneous\xe2\x80\x9d reaction process whereby H+ ion attack of the Si\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92Al linkages at the edges of the mineral surface leads to liberation of aluminum ions into the solution medium.

"The principal values of both the 13C and 15N chemical shift tensors are reported for the Zn, Ni, and Mg 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) complexes. The principal values of the 15N chemical shift tensors were obtained from static powder patterns of 15N-enriched samples. Due to overlap between the powder patterns of the different carbons, the 13C values were obtained using the recently developed magic angle turning (MAT) 2D experiment on unenriched materials. The measured principal values are presented along with theoretical calculations of the chemical shift tensors and a discussion of the effects that the metal bonding has on the chemical shift tensors in these compounds. Both the isotropic chemical shift and the principal values of the 15N chemical shift tensor are nearly identical for the Mg and Zn complexes. The 15N isotropic chemical shift for the NiTPP, however, changes by nearly 80 ppm relative to the Mg and Zn values, with large changes observed in each of the three principal values. Calculations show that the differences between the 15N chemical shifts are almost entirely determined by the metal\xe2\x88\x92nitrogen separation. In addition, both the experimental data and the calculations show only very minor differences in the 13C chemical shift tensor components as the metal is changed. "
"Accurate measurements of the magnitudes and relative orientations of chemical shielding, J coupling and dipolar coupling tensors for isolated homonuclear 31P\xe2\x88\x9231P spin pairs, using standard 31P MAS NMR experiments in conjunction with efficient numerical simulation and iterative fitting procedures are described. For a series of transition-metal phosphine complexes (R3P)2MX2, containing pairs of crystallographically equivalent phosphorus atoms such that they constitute isolated magnetically nonequivalent 31P\xe2\x88\x9231P spin-pair systems, it is demonstrated that the combined effects from MAS averaging, n = 0 rotational resonance dipolar recoupling, and J recoupling lead to 31P MAS NMR spectra with detailed structural features. These features are highly dependent on the tensorial interactions as well as on the applied external magnetic field strength and MAS frequency. The experimental observations are reproduced by numerically exact computer simulations. Iterative fitting of 31P MAS spectra, recorded under various experimental conditions, allows for determination of accurate parameters for the isotropic and anisotropic interactions characterizing the 31P\xe2\x88\x9231P spin pair. In particular, we demonstrate that the orientation of the chemical shielding tensors relative to each other and relative to the internuclear axis can be determined with high accuracy. "
"Resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy has been used to probe the interaction between dipyridophenazine (dppz) complexes of ruthenium(II), [Ru(L)2(dppz)]2+ (L = 1,10-phenanthroline (1) and 2,2-bipyridyl (2)), and calf-thymus DNA. Ground electronic state RR spectra at selected probe wavelengths reveal enhancement patterns which reflect perturbation of the dppz-centered electronic transitions in the UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectra in the presence of DNA. Comparison of the RR spectra recorded of the short-lived MLCT excited states of both complexes in aqueous solution with those of the longer-lived states of the complexes in the DNA environment reveals changes to excited state modes, suggesting perturbation of electronic transitions of the dppz ligand in the excited state as a result of intercalation. The most prominent feature, at 1526 cm-1, appears in the spectra of both 1 and 2 and is a convenient marker band for intercalation. For 1, the excited state studies have been extended to the \xce\x94 and \xce\x9b enantiomers. The marker band appears at the same frequency for both but with different relative intensities. This is interpreted as reflecting the distinctive response of the enantiomers to the chiral environment of the DNA binding sites. The results, together with some analogous data for other potentially intercalating complexes, are considered in relation to the more general application of time-resolved RR spectroscopy for investigation of intercalative interactions of photoexcited metal complexes with DNA.

"Electrochemical rate constants kel and volumes of activation \xce\x94Vel\xe2\xa7\xa7 for self-exchange at an electrode of the aqueous couples Co(phen)33+/2+, Co(en)33+/2+, Fe(H2O)63+/2+, Co(diamsar)3+/2+, Co(diamsarH2)3+/2+, Co(sep)3+/2+, Co(ttcn)23+/2+, Fe(phen)33+/2+, Mo(CN)83-/4-, and Fe(CN)63-/4- have been measured by high-pressure AC voltammetry over the range 0.1\xe2\x88\x92200 MPa at 25 \xc2\xb0C; the respective values of \xce\x94Vel\xe2\xa7\xa7 are \xe2\x88\x929.1, \xe2\x88\x928.3, \xe2\x88\x925.5, \xe2\x88\x923.5, \xe2\x88\x923.8, \xe2\x88\x923.0, \xe2\x88\x922.8, \xe2\x88\x921.6, +7.3, and +11 cm3 mol-1. Although the theory of Marcus (Electrochim. Acta 1968, 13, 1005) suggests that ln kel should be linearly related to 1/2 ln kex, where kex is the rate constant of the corresponding homogeneous (bimolecular) self-exchange reaction, ln kel is often sensitive to the nature of the working electrode and the supporting electrolyte and is only weakly correlated with ln kex, with slope \xe2\x89\x880.1. In contrast, \xce\x94Vel\xe2\xa7\xa7 = (0.50 \xc2\xb1 0.02)\xce\x94Vex\xe2\xa7\xa7, in precise agreement with an extension of Marcus\' theory, regardless of the nature of the electrode and the supporting electrolyte. This result implies that electron transfer in these couples occurs adiabatically on direct ion\xe2\x88\x92ion and ion\xe2\x88\x92electrode contact (i.e., within the outer Helmholtz plane), and also that \xce\x94Vel\xe2\xa7\xa7 values are predictable in the manner described elsewhere (Can. J. Chem. 1996, 74, 631) for \xce\x94Vex\xe2\xa7\xa7. Conversely, where \xce\x94Vex\xe2\xa7\xa7 cannot be measured for technical reasons (e.g., where paramagnetism of both reactants precludes NMR measurements of kex), it can be reliably estimated as 2\xce\x94Vel\xe2\xa7\xa7.

"The development of an optical trigger for protein folding is described. The optical trigger is an aryl disulfide embedded in a polypeptide such that the aryl disulfide constrains the peptide in a nonhelical conformation. Upon photocleavage of the SS bond, the peptide can then commence to fold into an \xce\xb1-helical conformation. Two thiotyrosine derivatives, (S)-4\xe2\x80\x98-mercaptophenylalanine (Tty) and 3-N-(4\xe2\x80\x98-mercaptophenyl)-(S)-2,3-diaminoproprionate (Aty), have been prepared and incorporated into polyalanine peptides. The ease of synthesis of protected forms of Tty and Aty amenable for solid phase synthesis, in four steps with 30% overall yield and six steps in 40% overall yield, respectively, make these attractive candidates as precursors of the optical trigger. CD and IR spectroscopy showed that the cyclic disulfide cross-linked peptides are much less helical than their linear counterparts. Following laser flash photolysis, peptide 7, which incorporates Tty, showed total recombination of the thiyl radicals within 1 ns. Peptide 16, which incorporates Aty, showed a significant amount of long-lived thiyl radicals from nanosecond to microsecond time scale. The process of recombination is hypothesized to be governed by the peptide conformation. Because of the significant amount of long-lived thiyl radicals generated from cyclic peptide 16, Aty should prove to be of general utility in the studies of protein folding on a time scale of sub-picoseconds and greater.

"Electrochemically controlled titrations of the different redox states detected by IR spectroscopy of Desulfovibrio gigas hydrogenase are reported. This enzyme has in common with other metal-containing hydrogenases the existence of three intense bands at exceptionally high frequencies that in Chromatium vinosum hydrogenase have been found to arise from two CN- and one CO (Happe, R. P.; Roseboom, W.; Pierik, A. J.; Albracht, S. P. J.; Bagley, K. A. Nature 1997, 385, 126). Here we propose a tentative assignment of these special groups to the three diatomic active site Fe ligands observed in the crystal structure of Desulfovibrio gigas hydrogenase (Volbeda, A.; Garcin, E.; Piras, C.; de Lacey, A. L.; Fernandez, V. M.; Hatchikian, E. C.; Frey, M.; Fontecilla-Camps, J. C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 12989\xe2\x88\x9212996), based on their interaction with the protein environment. IR states equivalent to each one of the Ni-EPR detectable states and their corresponding one-electron reduced EPR-silent forms have been identified by in situ redox titration. The similarity between the IR titration and the reported stoichiometric reductive titrations of EPR nickel signals of D. gigas enzyme (Roberts, L. M.; Lindahl, P. A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 2565\xe2\x88\x922572) suggest that there is a strong electronic interaction between the two metal centers in the active site. The IR-spectroelectrochemical technique used here allows for further insight into the activation, inactivation, and catalytic cycles of the enzyme. The path of activation and the identity of the active states have been characterized. "
"Ethylene polymerization catalyzed by zirconium and titanium chelating alkoxide complexes has been studied using a density functional method. Activation barriers of 6.4 and 7.4 kcal/mol are found for the titanium and zirconium sulfur-bridged catalysts, respectively. The Zr/Ti CH2- and directly-bridged catalysts have higher insertion barriers of 10\xe2\x88\x9215 kcal/mol. For the S-bridged systems, there is a strong interaction between the metal and the sulfur bridge, which leads to a less stabilized \xcf\x80-complex and a lower activation energy. The larger exothermicity to the \xce\xb3-agostic direct product by 5 kcal/mol in the titanium case compared to zirconium for all three catalysts (S-, CH2-, and directly-bridged) is suggested to be one of the reasons why the barriers for titanium are lower than for zirconium. Flexible ligands with the ability to donate may be one method for developing more active alternative catalysts as the flexible ligand competes with the approaching olefin. The more weakly bound olefin leads to a lower activation barrier. "
"The synthesis of oligoguanylates [oligo(G)s] is catalyzed by a template of oligocytidylates [oligo(C)s] containing 2\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98- and 3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-linked phosphodiester bonds with and without incorporated C5\xe2\x80\x98ppC groupings. An oligo(C) template containing exclusively 2\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-phosphodiester bonds also serves as a template for the synthesis of complementary oligo(G)s. The oligo(C) template was prepared by the condensation of the 5\xe2\x80\x98-phosphorimidazolide of cytidine on montmorillonite clay. These studies establish that RNA oligomers prepared by mineral catalysis, or other routes on the primitive earth, did not have to be exclusively 3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-linked to catalyze template-directed synthesis, since oligo(C)s containing a variety of linkage isomers serve as templates for the formation of complementary oligo(G)s. These findings support the postulate that origin of the RNA world was initiated by the RNA oligomers produced by polymerization of activated monomers formed by prebiotic processes. "
"We have synthesized a series of polyintercalating compounds, including the first known tetraintercalator, based on the 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide chromophore. The chromophores are attached in a head-to-tail arrangement by peptide linkers and are synthesized by standard solid phase peptide synthesis methods. We report evidence, based on UV\xe2\x88\x92visible spectroscopy and viscometry, that the compounds are fully intercalated upon binding to double-stranded DNA. Using DNAse I footprinting experiments, the bisintercalator 2 was found to bind to DNA in a cooperative manner. The footprinting results as well as association and dissociation kinetics data reveal that the compounds exhibit a tremendous preference for GC over AT sequences. A mode of binding is proposed in which the compounds intercalate completely from the major groove, and not in a threading manner as may be suggested by their structures. A kinetic scheme is proposed that takes into account the observed cooperativity and fits the data for the dissociations of the polyintercalators from poly(dAdT), although a similar scheme could not adequately model their dissociations from poly(dGdC) or from calf thymus DNA.

"As is true in solution, irradiation at 350 nm of 7-(10-thiodecoxy)coumarin (1) as a self-assembled monolayer on polycrystalline gold (Au-1) produces [2 + 2] photodimers. In the monolayer, photodimerization is indicated by differences in the grazing angle surface FTIR spectra, sessile drop contact angles, and surface fluorescence spectra before and after irradiation. The photodimerization can be reversed by irradiation at 254 nm, as demonstrated by changes in these same structural probes. Better photochemical reversibility and regioselectivity are observed when the in situ photodimerization is conducted as a dry solid monolayer than when in contact with benzene. A comparison of the structure of a self-assembled monolayer of a syn head-to-head (H-H) dimer of 7-(10-thiodecoxy)coumarin on polycrystalline gold (Au-2) with that of the photodimers generated by irradiation of Au-1 demonstrates that surface reorganization is accomplished in the photodimerization\xe2\x88\x92photoreversion cycle.

"Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation is used to investigate the kinetics and thermodynamics of some of the chemical reactions that occur during the induction phase of acid-catalyzed polymerization of 1,3,5-trioxane. In particular, the first ab initio calculation of a free-energy profile in a condensed-phase system is presented. The introduction of an H+ ion to a sample of trioxane liquid initiates the complete protolysis of several trioxane molecules in a rapid succession of picoseconds. Subsequently, the re-formation of small formaldehyde oligomers is observed, which break up again after 1\xe2\x88\x922 ps. The fast kinetics is found to be consistent with the results of a constrained ab initio molecular dynamics evaluation of the free-energy profile for the formation of a protonated dimer. In the trioxane\xe2\x88\x92formaldehyde mixture, this reaction is found to be barrierless with a reaction free energy in the thermal range (10 kJ mol-1). Solvation of the chemically active carbocation by formaldehyde molecules reduces the binding energy compared to that in the gas phase by 1 order of magnitude. "
"A general strategy for the synthesis of pentacyclic Strychnos alkaloids with the curan skeleton has been developed. It utilizes 3a-(2-nitrophenyl)hexahydroindol-4-one (23), which was prepared from 2-allyl-2-(2-nitrophenyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (15), as the common, pivotal intermediate. Three different procedures have been employed for the closure of the bridged piperidine D ring from 23:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) an intramolecular Michael-type conjugate addition; (ii) a Ni(COD)2-promoted biscyclization that assembles B and D rings in a single synthetic step, and (iii) an intramolecular cyclization of an enone\xe2\x88\x92propargylic silane system. When necessary, depending on the procedure used, introduction of the oxidized one-carbon substituent at C-16, closure of the indole ring, and/or adjustment of the functionality of the C-20 two-carbon chain constitute the last stages of the synthetic route to the title alkaloids. The procedure involving the cyclization of a propargylic silane has been successfully extended to the enantiospecific synthesis of (\xe2\x88\x92)-tubifolidine starting from the enantiopure 3a-(2-nitrophenyl)hexahydroindolone (\xe2\x88\x92)-51, which was prepared taking advantage of the prochiral character of cyclohexanedione 15.

When these compounds are directly enantioresolved by using the HPLC Okamoto column with a chiral stationary phase, optically pure enantiomers were obtained. The CD spectra of these chiral olefins exhibit very intense Cotton effects in the 1Bb transition region reflecting their strongly twisted \xcf\x80-electron systems. The CD and UV spectra of chiral olefins (M,M)-(E)-1 and (M,M)-(Z)-2 were theoretically calculated by the \xcf\x80-electron self-consistent field/configuration interaction/dipole velocity molecular orbital method.

"During the studies of the unique chiral olefins, (E)-1,1\xe2\x80\x98,2,2\xe2\x80\x98,3,3\xe2\x80\x98,4,4\xe2\x80\x98-octahydro-4,4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenanthrylidene (1) and its (Z)-isomer (2), we found the unexpected thermal racemization of cis-olefin 2 at room temperature. The CD spectrum of optically active 2 shows rapid decrease of intensity with the half-life time t1/2 = 1.2 h at room temperature. After the CD Cotton effects vanish, the sample of cis-olefin 2 was checked by HPLC with a chiral stationary phase, and two enantiomers of cis-olefin 2 were detected, but trans-olefin 1 was never detected. The racemization of sterically more-hindered cis-olefin 2 occurs by the direct interconversion between the two enantiomers (M,M)-(Z)-2 and (P,P)-(Z)-2 without formation of trans-olefin 1 as an intermediate. The enantiomeric interconversion between the two enantiomers of 2 was also studied by the 1H NMR magnetization transfer technique. The kinetic values of the enantiomeric interconversion of 2 were obtained by CD and NMR spectroscopic studies and lead to an activation energy Ea = 21.5 kcal mol-1, activation enthalpy \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 20.8 kcal mol-1, and activation entropy \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x928.5 cal K-1 mol-1.

"Unique chiral olefins with two methyl groups as the internal reference of absolute stereochemistry, (3R,3\xe2\x80\x98R)-(P,P)-(E)-(\xe2\x88\x92)-1,1\xe2\x80\x98,2,2\xe2\x80\x98,3,3\xe2\x80\x98,4,4\xe2\x80\x98-octahydro-3,3\xe2\x80\x98-dimethyl-4,4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenanthrylidene (3) and its (3R,3\xe2\x80\x98R)-(P,P)-(Z)-isomer (4), were synthesized in optically pure form starting from (3R,4R)-(+)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-methyl-4-phenanthrenol (11), which was obtained by the enantioresolution using a novel chiral auxiliary of dichlorophthalic acid amide (14). The absolute stereochemistry of chiral trans-dimethyl olefin (\xe2\x88\x92)-3 was determined by the X-ray crystallographic analyses of ester (\xe2\x88\x92)-16b and (\xe2\x88\x92)-3 itself. Optically pure cis-dimethyl olefin 4 was prepared by photochemical reaction of trans-olefin (\xe2\x88\x92)-3.

The CD spectrum of (3R,3\xe2\x80\x98R)-(P,P)-(E)-(\xe2\x88\x92)-3 is almost similar in shape but opposite in sign to that of (M,M)-(E)-1,1\xe2\x80\x98,2,2\xe2\x80\x98,3,3\xe2\x80\x98,4,4\xe2\x80\x98-octahydro-4,4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenanthrylidene (1).

The CD spectrum of (3R,3\xe2\x80\x98R)-(P,P)-(Z)-4 is also almost similar in shape but opposite in sign to that of (M,M)-(Z)-1,1\xe2\x80\x98,2,2\xe2\x80\x98,3,3\xe2\x80\x98,4,4\xe2\x80\x98-octahydro-4,4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenanthrylidene (2). The absolute stereochemistry of (M,M)-(Z)-2 theoretically determined was corroborated. "
"The preparative scale synthesis of dimesityldioxirane (5) via oxidation of dimesitylcarbene (6) is described. The dioxirane was obtained as colorless crystalline material, completely stable at \xe2\x88\x9220 \xc2\xb0C and characterized by spectroscopic methods, X-ray crystallography, and DFT calculations (B3LYP/6-31G(d)). The molecule shows approximately local C2 symmetry with the mesityl rings twisted by ca. 60\xc2\xb0. The experimental structural parameters, e.g., the O\xe2\x88\x92O distance of 1.503 \xc3\x85, are in good agreement with the theoretical values. The relief of steric strain caused by the mesityl groups is discussed in terms of the geometric distortion of the three-membered ring and the mesityl groups. Conformational features of 5 in solution are nicely reflected by measured and calculated (SOS-DFPT) NMR chemical shifts. "
"Imidinium ions, ArNCNR2+, were generated in aqueous solution from the solvolysis of fluoro and chloro formamidines at pH 9.3 and 25 \xc2\xb0C. Rate constants for the hydration of five imidinium ions were determined from a kinetic analysis of their trapping by thiolacetate anion, CH3COS-, in the presence of a pool of competing fluoride anion, and a rate constant of kAcS\xe2\x88\x92 = 5 \xc3\x97 109 M-1 s-1 for diffusion-controlled trapping of the carbocations with thiolacetate anion. The rate constants, ks, for hydration of the imidinium ions, XArNCNC4H8O+ are 3.6 \xc3\x97 105, 5.8 \xc3\x97 105, 1.5 \xc3\x97 106, 1.6 \xc3\x97 106, and 1.8 \xc3\x97 106 s-1 for X = H, 4-Cl, 3-CN, 4-CN, and 3-NO2, respectively. In a similar experiment a rate constant of ks = 3.3 \xc3\x97 107 s-1 was obtained for hydration of the imidinium ion 4-NO2ArNCNCH3(OCH3)+, by using azide anion to trap the cation and a rate constant of kaz = 5 \xc3\x97 109 M-1 s-1 for diffusion-controlled trapping of the imidinium ion with azide ion. The partitioning rate constant ratio kAcS\xe2\x88\x92/ks for 4-ClArNCNC4H8O+ decreases by approximately 6-fold in 45% v/v glycerol/water in contrast to kaz/ks, which remains almost constant, showing that thiolacetate, but not azide anion, combines with the imidinium ion at a diffusion-limited rate. The reactivity of the imidinium ions deviate from behavior predicted by the N+ scale in a manner that may be explained by a difference in the selectivity of the cation when compared to the more stable N+ carbocations.

"meso-\xce\xb1,\xce\xb1,\xce\xb1,\xce\xb1-Tetrakis(2-hydroxy-1-naphthyl)porphyrin (1) and 5,15-cis-bis(2-hydroxy-1-naphthyl)-10,20-diphenylporphyrin (2) were prepared as receptors for ubiquinone analogues. UV\xe2\x88\x92vis, IR, NMR, and X-ray crystal data reveal that these porphyrins bind a series of quinones with a cofacial structure linked by hydrogen bonds. The binding constants of 1 for quinones increase with the number of MeO substituents bound to a quinone ring. Compared to 2,5-dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone, 2,3-dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone shows more favorable negative changes in \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0 and \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 upon binding with 1, whereas the interaction between 2 and quinone is not affected by the position and number of MeO substituents. Thus the two adjacent MeO substituents cooperatively act as the third recognition site for OH groups in 1 to form the bifurcated hydrogen bonding. Particularly, tetramethoxy-p-benzoquinone (4f) shows an extremely large affinity and favorable \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 with 1 due to the formation of simultaneous multiple hydrogen bonds; \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0 = \xe2\x88\x927.9 kcal/mol at 298 K in toluene. The van\'t Hoff plots obtained from titrimetric measurement at 0.9\xe2\x88\x925.2 mol % ethanol in toluene reveal a nonlinear relationship between R ln K and 1/T. The curvature of these plots is explained in terms of the temperature dependence of the degree of functional groups solvation in 1 and 4f with a negative heat capacity change; \xce\x94Cp\xc2\xb0 = \xe2\x88\x925.6 \xc3\x97 102 cal/mol\xc2\xb7K at 0.9 mol % ethanol, indicating that the solvent\xe2\x88\x92solute interaction has a crucial effect on the stability of the host\xe2\x88\x92guest complexes.

"The syntheses and X-ray structures of very large polycyclic aromatic compounds containing clefts defined by polyphenylaryl groups are described. The C2-symmetric \xe2\x80\x9calbatrossenes\xe2\x80\x9d 1,3-bis(heptaphenyl-2-naphthyl)benzene (7a) and 1,3-bis(heptaphenyl-1-naphthyl)benzene (12a), as well as brominated derivatives, were synthesized by the addition of tetraphenylbenzyne to the appropriate polyphenyl biscyclopentadienones. The 2-naphthyl isomers have wide, shallow clefts, and the 1-naphthyl isomers have deep, narrow clefts which were observed to change size dramatically in different crystal environments. In a similar way, 1,3,5-tris(pentaphenylphenyl)benzene (19), a D3-symmetric molecular propeller with a diameter of 21 \xc3\x85, and 1,3,5-tris(heptaphenyl-2-naphthyl)benzene (22) were prepared by the addition of diphenylacetylene and tetraphenylbenzyne, respectively, to a triscyclopentadienone.

"Irradiation of cyclic 1,3-diones (1a and 2a) with C60 in benzene leads to formation of two fused furanylfullerenes, one achiral (3) and the other chiral (4), as opposed to the expected De Mayo cyclooctane-1,3-dione addition product. The same products are obtained when 1,3-diones are replaced with trimethylsilyl-protected diones (1b and 2b). The adduct structures were characterized by MS (ESI and MALDI), IR, UV, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 3He NMR spectroscopy. These fullerene adducts presumably are formed after initial [2 + 2] photocycloaddition, followed by either intermolecular oxidation of the cyclobutyl intermediates (5\xe2\x88\x928) by 1O2 to form 3 or intramolecular oxidation of the appended group by the triplet fullerene moiety of 5\xe2\x88\x928 to form 4. "
"At >200 K photolysis of 1-(2-azidophenyl)-3,5-dimethylpyrazole (5) gives 1,3-dimethylpyrazolobenzotriazole (6, by electrophilic cyclization of singlet nitrene 14) or, in the presence of diethylamine, aminoazepine 8 (by addition of the nucleophile and rearrangement). At lower temperatures, the yield of these products decreases and the azo derivative 9 (from the dimerization of triplet nitrene 34) as well as products from intramolecular radical cyclization (again via 34) is obtained, to become the only products at <100 K. Differential thermodynamic parameters for the reactions of 14 and 34 are determined by analysis of the temperature dependence of products distribution (\xce\x94\xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9210 kJ mol-1 and \xce\x94\xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 34 J mol-1 K-1 in ethanol). Addition of the amine may require previous ring enlargement to give the dehydroazepine 12; there is no indication that this is an intermediate of any stability, however, and if formed, this is in equilibrium with 14. Triplet nitrene 34 is characterized in matrix by UV spectroscopy, and its photoreactions (to give mainly intramolecular hydrogen abstraction) are separately studied. "
"Activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) by NO correlates with scission of the proximal iron\xe2\x88\x92histidine bond, as demonstrated by the application of electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy to the study of metalloporphyrin-substituted enzymes. The non-native metalloporphyrins, Mn(II)PPIX and Co(II)PPIX, can be introduced into heme-deficient sGC forming five-coordinate complexes. The similarity among Mn(II)sGC, Co(II)sGC, and the corresponding metalloporphyrin-substituted derivatives of Mb and Hb provides confirming evidence for the presence of an axial histidine ligand in sGC. Upon addition of NO, Mn(II)sGC forms a six-coordinate species with the histidine ligand still bound to the Mn, and the enzyme is not activated. In contrast, the Co(II)sGC(NO) adduct is five-coordinate and the enzyme is activated. These data imply that the activated state of sGC is attained when the proximal histidine\xe2\x88\x92metal bond is broken. "
" Density functional calculations have been performed on the excited states of Cr(CO)6. In contrast to the generally accepted assignment of the spectrum by Gray and Beach1,2 but in agreement with recent CASSCF/CASPT2 calculations by Pierloot et al.3 we find the low-intensity absorption at the low-energy side of the first charge-transfer (CT) band not to be due to ligand-field (LF) excited states, but to symmetry forbidden CT excitations. In Cr(CO)6 as in other d6 metal\xe2\x88\x92carbonyl complexes,4-6 the LF states are at high energy. The calculations show that two states arising from the low-energy CT configuration have dissociative potential energy surfaces, in agreement with the experimentally observed photodissociation of the Cr\xe2\x88\x92CO bond upon low-energy absorption. The photodissociation is therefore occurring from CT and not from LF states. This leads to a reassessment of the role of LF states in metal\xe2\x88\x92ligand photodissociation:\xe2\x80\x89 it is not necessary to excite to LF states in order to induce photodissociation of ligands, and such dissociation, when observed, does not prove that the excitation was to a LF state. "
"Kinetic measurements as well as B3LYP/ and MP2/6-31G(d,p) calculations provide evidence that carbonyl oxides formed in the gas-phase ozonolysis of alkylated alkenes are an important source of OH radicals. In the gas-phase ozonolysis of propene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene, tetramethylethene, and isoprene, 18, 17, 24, 36, and 19% OH radicals (relative to reacted ozone, error margin \xe2\x89\xa44%) are measured using CO as a scavenger for OH. The quantum chemical calculations show that OH radical production depends on syn positioned methyl (alkyl) groups and their interaction with the terminal O atom of a carbonyl oxide. For example, in the gas-phase ozonolysis of ethene only 5% OH radicals are measured while for a carbonyl oxide with syn-positioned methyl (alkyl) group, a much larger amount of OH radicals is formed. This is due to the fact that 1,4 H migration and the formation of an intermediate hydroperoxy alkene, that is prone to undergo OO bond cleavage, is energetically more favorable than isomerization to dioxirane. In the case of syn-methyl, dimethyl, and isopropenyl carbonyl oxide calculated activation enthalpies at 298 K are 14.8, 14.4, and 15.5 kcal/mol compared to the corresponding dioxirane isomerization barriers of 23.8, 21.4, and 23.0 kcal/mol, respectively. The OO cleavage reactions of the hydroperoxy alkenes formed in these cases are just 11, 12.8, and 10.3 kcal/mol. "
"Reaction kinetics of cyclic carbon cluster ions C10+ to C24+ with acrylonitrile, four isomeric C4 nitriles, and pyrrole and pyridine are reported at 300 K. A prominent 4-fold periodicity was observed in reactivity with the five nitriles, with the highest reactivity being observed for the n = 4k + 1 series of Cn+ cluster ions. This is interpreted as reflecting enhanced reactivity for the Cn+ cluster ions which have an antiaromatic 4k electron count in the HOMO. The reactivity dropped off markedly with increasing cluster size, which is considered to indicate sharply decreasing cluster-ion/nitrile binding energy with increasing cluster size. By contrast, nearly all the cluster ions reacted rapidly with pyridine and pyrrole. A two-step mechanistic picture is discussed in which the overall reaction rate is controlled by the initial electronic interaction between the cluster ion and the neutral reactant, while subsequent bond-making/bond-breaking reactions are governed by the potential surface of the complex and are strongly affected by the available energy. Judging by reaction rates with acrylonitrile and crotononitrile, most of the carbon cluster ions generated by graphite ablation in the present work were identical with the corresponding ions previously generated by Sun et al. by ionization of perchlorohydrocarbons, although some differences in reactivity were found for ions of low reactivity.

"Group 6 metal atoms, generated by laser ablation, react with CO2 to give the insertion products OMCO and O2M(CO)2 (M = Cr, Mo, or W) which have been isolated in argon matrices and identified by the effects of isotopic substitution on their infrared spectra. These assignments have been supported by DFT calculations, and the theoretical and experimental spectra are in excellent agreement. Other products include the molecules O2MCO, MO, and MCO and the CO2 complex Cr (\xce\xb71-OCO) which, upon irradiation with UV-light, will photoisomerize to give OCrCO, an interesting example of photoactivation of CO2.

"One-bond 1H,13C and geminal 1H,1H dipolar interactions are normally the dominant causes of 1H and 13C transverse relaxation in NMR experiments applied to 13C,15N-labeled RNA in solution. Proton,carbon multiple-quantum coherences, where all heteronuclei connected by single bonds are evolved simultaneously in the transverse plane, however, are not affected by these strong dipolar interactions. Consequently, the transverse lifetimes, or T2 values, of these resonances can be dramatically extended. Here, we show that pulse sequences can be written that take advantage of this effect to enhance the sensitivity with which CH and CH2 correlations are observed in uniformly 13C,15N-labeled RNA oligonucleotides. In heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation experiments, CH and CH2 correlations are detected with a sensitivity that is enhanced by about a factor of 3 relative to heteronuclear, single-quantum experiments for a 13C,15N-labeled 36mer RNA oligonucleotide and a constant time period of 25 ms. By including 1H,13C multiple-quantum coherence steps in an 1H,13C,15N NMR experiment of the \xe2\x80\x9cout and back\xe2\x80\x9d type currently used for through-bond resonance assignment in RNA, we have obtained a sensitivity enhancement of about a factor of 5 in the same 36mer RNA.

"We demonstrate the ability to adjust and control the magnitude of the third-order nonlinear response of a conjugated polymer, the processable polydiacetylene poly(4BCMU), through macroscopic polymer processing techniques. The demonstration of control over \xcf\x87(3) in a conjugated polymer is accomplished by using stimulated inverse Raman scattering. The control is achieved through the balance of two opposing effects introduced by processing:\xe2\x80\x89 the enhancement in nonlinear response per chromophore unit and the misalignment of the chromophores relative to the incident linearly polarized electric field. We observe a significant enhancement of the nonlinear response in the stretch-aligned material compared to the non-aligned material, with the enhancement limited in our measurements by the extent to which the optically active polymer and supporting substrate can be elongated.

"Diffusion of Li and Na ions in TiO2, anatase, has been studied using theoretical (quantum chemical ab initio periodic Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock and a modified semiempirical INDO) as well as electrochemical (chronocoloumetry) methods. On the basis of the theoretical calculations, the geometry of equilibrium and transition states for the impurities as well as the crystalline framework are analyzed and discussed. The calculated activation energies for Li+ and Na+ diffusion were found to be only slightly higher than 0.5 eV by both theoretical methods. The agreement of either theoretical method with the electrochemical experiments, 0.60 and 0.52 eV for Li+ and Na+, respectively, is also remarkably good. "
"A systematic study of the efficiency of photoluminescence (PL) quenching of nanocrystalline porous Si by aromatic triplet energy acceptors was carried out. The effects of molecular triplet energy, molecular size, and the porous Si emission energy on PL quenching efficiency were probed. Photoluminescent porous Si samples, prepared by electrochemical etch, were titrated with toluene solutions of anthracene, 9,10-diphenylanthracene, 9,10-dichloroanthracene, 9,10-dimethylanthracene, pyrene, 1,2-benzanthracene, acridine, and 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene, and the steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra were measured. The quenching of PL adequately fits a dynamic Stern\xe2\x88\x92Volmer quenching model. The rate of quenching increases with increasing exoergicity, and then levels off at higher exoergicities. The mechanism of quenching is attributed to energy transfer from the porous Si excited state to the triplet levels of the quencher molecules. The rate of quenching can also be affected by the size of substituents on the quenchers; some molecules with larger substituents display slower quenching rates than expected from their triplet energies.

"We report a systematic study of the electronic structure of the five metcars in the title using anion photoelectron spectroscopy. The electron affinities of the metcars are measured and are found to be metal dependent and increase from Ti8C12 to Cr8C12. The electronic structures of Zr8C12 and Nb8C12 are found to be similar to Ti8C12 and V8C12, respectively. All the spectra can be qualitatively interpreted by the molecular orbital schemes derived from a tetracapped tetrahedral M8C12 cluster. This work provides yet the most quantitative electronic and spectroscopic information about the metcars, as well as evidence supporting the tetrahedral structure for the metcars. "
"Knowledge of RNA structure can greatly facilitate the understanding of its biological function. However, the physical properties of RNA, especially its conformational heterogeneity, present an impediment to high-resolution structural analysis. Thus, lower resolution methods such as biochemical probing, phylogenetic analysis, and molecular modeling have come to serve an important role in RNA science. This situation has created the need for a means by which to constrain RNA structure, either to reduce its conformational flexibility or to help distinguish between alternative structural models. To address this need, we have developed chemistry that permits the site-specific introduction of functionalizable tethers into RNA. Here we report the design and synthesis of reagents for use in solid-phase RNA synthesis that allow the functionalization of the base moiety of G, C, and A residues. Upon incorporation into oligonucleotides and subsequent treatment with alkylamines, the convertible nucleoside derivatives reported here give rise to functionally tethered N4-alkyl-C, N6-alkyl-A, and N2-alkyl-G residues in RNA. The derivatized RNAs can then be used to target the attachment of chemical probes or the placement of disulfide cross-links as structural constraints. The attachment of nonnatural functional groups to RNA in this fashion provides a powerful means of both probing its structural environment and constraining its conformation. The size and functionality of the N-alkyl modification is determined solely by the choice of alkylamine, thereby permitting the preparation of a wide range of functionally tethered RNAs. "
"Protein-film voltammetry reveals the global effects of H/D isotopic substitutions, both in organic substrates and solvent, on bidirectional catalytic electron transport in a mitochondrial respiratory enzyme, succinate dehydrogenase. The voltammetry is controlled by the enzyme kinetics and therefore provides a direct display of the characteristic relationships between turnover rates (current) and driving force (potential). This enables simultaneous measurement of relative electron-transport rates for oxidative and reductive directions alongside thermodynamic data (reduction potentials) relating to substrates and active sites. Measured over a range of pH and pD, the relationships between effective catalytic potentials of the enzyme and formal reduction potentials for substrate and active-site yield a \xe2\x80\x9cpotential-domain\xe2\x80\x9d description of the catalytic energetics, which complements and extends the picture obtained by conventional kinetic methods. For the organic substrates, a marked decrease is observed in the rate of oxidation of perdeuteriosuccinate compared to succinate, but there is no change upon deuterating fumarate. On changing the solvent from H2O to D2O there is a significant decrease in catalytic activity, particularly in the direction of fumarate reduction. Simultaneously, the characteristic potentials of the enzyme (active-site FAD and effective catalytic potentials) are raised but to a lesser extent than is the reduction potential of the substrate. The catalytic energetics are thus altered. For the first time with a complex redox enzyme, the results enable H/D substitution effects to be rationalized in terms of the changes introduced in overall driving force and enzyme reduction potentials, as well as the effects of intrinsic kinetic processes.

"Irradiation of DNA with UV-B light causes the formation of mutagenic DNA lesions such as cis\xe2\x88\x92syn and trans\xe2\x88\x92syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. DNA photolyases are flavin-dependent repair enzymes which directly revert the mutagenic cis\xe2\x88\x92syn pyrimidine dimers into the corresponding monomers by a light-facilitated repair reaction. To gain deeper insight into the repair process, we recently prepared flavin-containing model compounds which are able to mimic the repair reaction (Carell, T.; Epple, R.; Gramlich, V. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl. 1996, 35, 620\xe2\x88\x92623). This publication now contains a detailed description of the synthesis of a series of related model compounds and a comprehensive investigation of their cleavage properties. The results obtained help to unravel the requirements necessary for an efficient, flavin-mediated cleavage of pyrimidine dimers and provide insight into the factors on which the enzymatic repair process depends. The investigation of the cleavage reaction with cis\xe2\x88\x92syn, trans\xe2\x88\x92syn, and trans\xe2\x88\x92anti cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer model compounds reveal an enhanced vulnerability for the cis\xe2\x88\x92syn isomer. The trans\xe2\x88\x92syn dimer is 10 times more stable. These results are comparable to those observed in a recent study on the E. coli enzyme. The excellent solubility of some of the model compounds has allowed a medium-dependent investigation of the flavin-initiated cleavage reaction. Increased cleavage efficiencies are observed in polar solvents such as water (\xcf\x86 = 0.06) and acetonitrile (\xcf\x86 = 0.05). The quantum yields decrease by a factor of 4 in solvents with very low polarity such as dioxane (\xcf\x86 = 0.01). These results are not in agreement with earlier solvent-dependent evaluations performed with non-flavin-containing model compounds (Hartzfeld, D. G.; Rose, S. D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 850\xe2\x88\x92854). The results, however, suggest that the unusually polar flavin-binding pocket, observed in the X-ray crystal structure of the E. coli. photolyase, might be required to increase the catalytic repair efficiency. Investigations of the cleavage reaction in the presence of acid and base in organic solvents emphasize the strict requirement for a deprotonated reduced riboflavin chromophore. The determined pH values for half-maximal (pH = 6.5) and maximal (7 \xe2\x89\xa4 pH \xe2\x89\xa4 9) cleavage efficiencies are in agreement with the pKa value (pKa = 6.3) of the reduced riboflavin and reveal that physiological conditions are required to reach maximum catalytic cleavage efficiency.

"Lithiation of trovacene [(\xce\xb77-tropylium)vanadium(\xce\xb75-cyclopentadienyl)] (1\xe2\x80\xa2) and appropriate subsequent reactions afforded trovacenyl carboxylic acid (\xce\xb77-C7H7)V(\xce\xb75-C5H4COOH) (2\xe2\x80\xa2) and its anhydride [(\xce\xb77-C7H7)V(\xce\xb75-C5H4CO)]2O (3\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2). The deuterated acid 2\xe2\x80\xa2-d1 was also prepared; 2\xe2\x80\xa2, 2\xe2\x80\xa2-d1, and 3\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 were characterized by X-ray structural analysis. The dimeric hydrogen bonded structure of 2\xe2\x80\xa2 which is found in the crystal also prevails in aprotic, nonpolar solvents and gives rise to a biradical EPR spectrum from which the electron exchange coupling constant J = \xe2\x88\x920.011 cm-1 can be determined via computer simulation. Thus, exchange interaction across eight bonds is observable even though the spacer contains weak hydrogen bonds. Considerably stronger exchange coupling (J = \xe2\x88\x920.345 cm-1) is displayed by the anhydride 3\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2. The EPR spectrum of 2\xe2\x80\xa2 in toluene is temperature dependent as expected for the equilibrium 2 (2\xe2\x80\xa2) \xe2\x87\x8c (2\xe2\x80\xa2)2 which leads to the superposition of monomer and dimer spectra at ratios governed by temperature. The enthalpy of dimerization can thus be derived; it amounts to \xe2\x88\x9211.8 kcal mol-1 for 2\xe2\x80\xa2 and \xe2\x88\x9215.2 kcal mol-1 for 2\xe2\x80\xa2-d1. The 1H NMR spectrum of the radical 2\xe2\x80\xa2 reveals the positive contact shift \xce\x94\xce\xb4 = 3 ppm for the carboxylic proton, relative to the chemical shift observed for the diamagnetic organometallic acid Cr(\xce\xb76-C6H5COOH)2. Conceivably, the finite spin density on the carboxyl group, present in the monomer 2\xe2\x80\xa2, contributes to the exchange interaction displayed by the hydrogen bonded dimer (2\xe2\x80\xa2)2. The redox potential E1/2 (2+/0) and the hyperfine coupling constant a(51V, 2\xe2\x80\xa2) are pH dependent. In the former case, a Nernst\xe2\x88\x92Clark plot furnishes the pKs values of 4.4 for neutral 2\xe2\x80\xa2 and 1.85 for the cation 2+. A similar value, pKs(2\xe2\x80\xa2) = 3.7, is read off the plot a(51V, 2\xe2\x80\xa2) versus pH. "
"We used molecular dynamics (MD) techniques to examine the encapsulation of Bengal Rose (BR) molecules in the Meijer dendrimer box (DBox) formed by the addition of tert-butyloxycarbonyl-l-Phe (tBOC-l-Phe) cap molecules to the 64 terminal primary amines of a fifth generation poly(propyleneimine) (PPI-5) dendrimer. Using a large periodic box (including DBox, four to six BR, and CH2Cl2 solvent, totaling \xe2\x88\xbc25\xe2\x80\x89000 atoms), we examined the MD of these systems for \xe2\x88\xbc0.5 ns. Without the cap we find that BR molecules establish a concentration dependent equilibrium between the interior and surface regions of PPI-5 and the solvent region outside the dendrimer. The number of BR molecules calculated to associate with the interior of the PPI-5 dendrimer agrees exactly with experiment (at the same BR/PPI concentration). MD simulations on the DBox in CH2Cl2 show that the tBOC-l-Phe surface is completely impermeable to encapsulated BR molecules, even when an excess is forced inside the box. The close correspondence of the theory with experiment suggests that these methods can be used to design such systems in advance of experiment. "
"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to study the dynamical and time-averaged characteristics of the DNA triple helix d(T)10\xc2\xb7d(A)10\xc2\xb7d(T)10. The structures sampled during the trajectory resemble closely the B-type model for the DNA triplex proposed on the basis of NMR data, although there are some subtle differences. Alternative P- and A-type conformations for the triplex, suggested from X-ray experiments, are not predicted to contribute significantly to the structure of the DNA triplex in solution. Comparison with the best available experimental data supports the correctnes of the MD-generated structures. The analysis of the collected data gives a detailed picture of the characteristics of triple-helix DNA. A new and interesting pattern of hydration, specific for triplex DNA, is an important observation. The results suggest that molecular dynamics can be useful for the study of novel nucleic acid structures. "
"A new and efficient preparation of anti-o,o\xe2\x80\x98-dibenzene 1 has been achieved in three steps from cis-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,2-diol 25. Utilizing a method for deoxygenation of 1,2-diols developed in our laboratory, anti-tetraol 23 was converted to 1 in 65% yield on a 0.5 g scale. This has allowed us to explore the chemistry of anti-dibenzenes extensively. The kinetics for thermal reversion of 1 to benzene have been studied in three different solvents. The direct photolysis of 1 to benzene has been found to form excited benzene in unit efficiency. This high efficiency of adiabatic photon up-conversion in the singlet manifold is unprecedented. No light was detected in the thermal dissociation of 1 in solution using various sensitizers. The chemiluminescence spectrum from the thermolysis of 1 in the presence of perylene has been recorded and found to correspond to the emission of perylene excimer. Although the efficiency of the chemiluminescent process was very low, it has proven to be one of a very few examples of chemiluminescent reactions from pure hydrocarbons. The possible mechanisms were discussed. Benzene 1,4-endoperoxide 36 was formed during the photolysis of monoperoxide 34 at low temperature. Peroxide 36 underwent a quantitative concerted retrocycloaddition to benzene and singlet oxygen. The half-life of 36 was determined to be 29 min at \xe2\x88\x9230 \xc2\xb0C. "
"The enantioselective synthesis of (+)-laurencin 1 has been achieved in 27 steps from (R)-malic acid 20. The key steps involved methylenation of the lactone 49 followed by intramolecular hydrosilation of the enol ether 14 (Scheme 11) and one carbon homologation of the diol 13 to give the key ethyl substituted cyclic ether 59 (Scheme 13). The lactone 49 was obtained by two efficient routes, namely a Claisen ring expansion (Scheme 3) followed by \xce\xb1-hydroxylation (Scheme 6) and a Yamaguchi lactonization (Scheme 11). Elaboration of the (E)-pentenynyl side chain (Scheme 18) and introduction of bromine (Scheme 19) completed the synthesis of (+)-laurencin 1. "
"\xce\x945-Oxocenes, such as cis-3-hydroxy-2-vinyl-\xce\x945-oxocenes, can be generated by an intramolecular aldehyde\xe2\x88\x92allylboration reaction. This allowed a rapid and stereoselective access to the trisubstituted oxocene 24 which had been transformed by the Holmes group into (+)-laurencin. The key feature of this effective intramolecular allylboration reaction is that both the aldehyde and the allylboronate functionality have been generated in a masked form in situ. They are liberated by an aqueous workup which initiates the ring closure reaction. "
"The controlled hydrolysis products of R3M (M = Al, Ga; R = Mes, Ph, Me) have been found to be stabilized by deprotonation reactions using alkyllithium reagents. (Mes3Ga\xc2\xb7OHLi)\xc2\xb73THF (1) and (Mes3Al\xc2\xb7OHLi)\xc2\xb73THF (3) were synthesized by the reaction of LiOH with Mes3Ga and Mes3Al, respectively. The hydroxides, (R2MOH)n, resulting from the reaction of water and R3M were deprotonated with RLi (R = tBu, Me) to give (Mes2GaOLi)2\xc2\xb74THF (2), (Mes2AlOLi)2\xc2\xb74THF (4), (Ph2AlOLi)3\xc2\xb76THF (5), and (Me2AlOLi)4\xc2\xb77THF\xc2\xb7LiCl (6). The molecular structures of compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 have been determined by X-ray structure analysis. Whereas 2 undergoes metathesis reactions, compounds 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are stable at room temperature. Compound 6 is the first structurally characterized intermediate on the pathway to cocatalytically active methylalumoxane used in metallocene catalyzed olefin polymerization reactions. Moreover, it represents the first structurally characterized alumoxane stabilized by a separated cation. "
"Complete geometry optimizations were carried out by methods of density functional theory to study molecular structures of dinuclear transition-metal compounds containing metal\xe2\x88\x92metal bonds of various orders. It is shown that the structures of the dinuclear compounds can be accurately predicted by DFT methods. In particular, we show that accurate geometry optimization can be performed efficiently by using small basis sets in the calculations. Furthermore, an effective core potential approximation may be incorporated into the DFT calculations for computational effectiveness without losing much accuracy. The molecules included in this study were M2(O2CH)4 (M = Nb, Mo, Tc), M2(HNCHNH)4 (M = Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh), M2(HNNNH)4 (M = Mo, Ru, Rh), and M2Cl4(PH3)4 (M = Nb, Mo, Tc). "
"Employing fast time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopy we have characterized CpRe(CO)2(n-heptane), CpRe(CO)2(Xe), and CpRe(CO)2(Kr) (Cp = \xce\xb75-C5H5) at or above room temperature in n-heptane, supercritical Xe, and Kr solution. The reactivity of CpRe(CO)2(n-heptane) with CO (k2 = 2.1 (\xc2\xb10.5) \xc3\x97 103 mol-1 dm3 s-1) shows this complex to be the least reactive of the reported organometallic alkane complexes. We report a trend in reactivity of the early transition metal alkane complexes. CpRe(CO)2(Xe) and CpRe(CO)2(Kr) are also shown to have significant stability. CpRe(CO)2(Xe) is less reactive toward CO than all of the reported alkane complexes except CpRe(CO)2(n-heptane). "
"In polar solvents, Rh(III) porphyrins are directly reduced in Rh(I) complexes which react readily with Br\xc3\xb6nsted acids to give Rh(III) hydrides. They then undergo, at a more negative potential, an additional electron uptake to yield the corresponding Rh(II) hydrides. The electrogenerated rhodium(II) complex is the key intermediate of catalytic hydrogen evolution according to a mechanism which heavily depends on the solvent and on axial ligands. In DMSO, hydride transfer from Rh(II)H- to the acid, yielding H2, competes with hydride transfer reduction of the solvent by both Rh(III)H and Rh(II)H-. In a less-complexing solvent, such as butyronitrile, hydrogen evolution occurs both by hydride transfer to the acid and H-atom abstraction to the solvent. The latter pathway is shut off by the addition of strong and soft ligands such as tertiary phosphines. With PEt3, a particularly strong electron-donating ligand, not only Rh(II)H- but also Rh(III)H triggers H2 evolution. The various changes of the hydrogen evolution mechanism as well as the stability of the catalyst can be rationalized by the variation of the electron density distribution brought about by the presence or the absence of the axial ligand. "
"Binding affinities of (R,R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine (R) to (R,R)-1,2-cyclopentanediol (R5) and (S,S)-1,2-cyclopentanediol (S5) and to the corresponding cyclohexanediols (R6 and S6) have been measured in benzene and in CCl4 at 298 K by microcalorimetry, and unexpected differences between the diastereomeric complexes are observed. Long time scale (0.1 \xce\xbcs) molecular-dynamics simulations of the two smaller diastereomeric complexes, R/R5 and R/S5, in a simplified solvent model are reported. A direct free energy calculation gives results in good agreement with the experimental values measured in benzene for the first pair, but nearly identical results for the second pair, which is at variance with experiment. A systematic analysis of the dependence of simulation results on model parameters is performed, and no possibility is found to improve the enantioselectivity by parameter tuning. Other possible causes for discrepancies are specific solute\xe2\x88\x92solvent or solvent\xe2\x88\x92solvent interactions, electronic charge redistribution effects, or formation of clusters of more than two molecules. Owing to the long time scales reached, a well-converged picture of the dynamics is obtained, and the species present at equilibrium can be studied in detail. The average lifetime of the complex is found to be about 200 ps, whereas that of a hydrogen bond is only about 5 ps. Besides the unbound state, the dominant species observed in the simulations for both diastereomeric pairs are singly hydrogen-bonded complexes, with a clear preference for a O to N over the N to O hydrogen bond. Many other hydrogen-bonding patterns (bridged, double) are also observed in minor amounts. "
"The energetics and structural properties of 1,3-dithiane (1), 2-phenyl-1,3-dithiane (2), and their corresponding axial and equatorial 2-lithio derivatives have been probed by using density functional theory (DFT) at the Becke3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. In agreement with the experimental observations, a very high preference for the equatorial orientation of the C\xe2\x88\x92Li bond is calculated, the calculated energy difference between 1-Li-ax and 1-Li-eq being 14.2 kcal\xc2\xb7mol-1 and the calculated energy difference between 2-Li-ax and 2-Li-eq being 4.10 kcal\xc2\xb7mol-1. Population analysis indicates high positive charge at lithium and small C\xe2\x88\x92Li Wiberg bond indexes in these 1,3-dithianyllithiums, suggesting an ionic rather than covalent nature for the C\xe2\x88\x92Li bond. The collected structural data are in line with the expectation that nC \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x83*S-C hyperconjugation stabilizes the equatorial isomers, whereas nC/nS repulsive orbital interactions destabilize the axial isomers. Nevertheless, coordination of equatorial lithium by the ring sulfurs is apparent in the computed contact ion pairs for 1-Li-eq and 2-Li-eq. An interesting structure was predicted for the axial form of 2-lithio-2-phenyl-1,3-dithiane wherein the lithium is bonded to C(2), Cipso, Cortho, and one of the ring sulfurs, in a highly delocalized system in the case of the minimum energy isomer. "
"Thermal ring opening of N-[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]-2-carbomethoxyaziridine in the presence of C60 produces a fulleropyrrolidine derivative which is then attached covalently to HPLC silica gel. The new chromatographic material is used to investigate binding affinities of potential hosts for the immobilized C60. Exceptionally high size selectivities have been obtained for cyclic oligomeric compounds like calixarenes and cyclodextrins in organic and water-rich media, respectively. A number of rationally designed, helical-shaped peptides bind selectively to the grafted fullerene. The most tightly bound peptide carries two ferrocene moieties at the periphery of a hydrophobic binding cavity complementary in size to C60. "
"13C CP/MAS NMR studies were carried out on trans-1,2-cyclopentanediol, on 4,4-dimethyl-trans-1,2-cyclopentanediol, and on sulfolane at variable temperatures. The spectra showed evidence of three dynamic solid-state processes:\xe2\x80\x89 hydrogen bond exchange, ring pseudorotation, and whole molecule rotations about local C2 axes. Fitting of T1\xcf\x81 data to calculated values of the 13C\xe2\x88\x921H dipolar interactions allowed differentiation between ring pseudorotations and whole molecule C2 reorientations. Isotopic 1H/2H substitution demonstrated the existence of hydrogen bond exchange processes in the diols. Activation parameters for these processes were derived from both coalescence measurements and the T1\xcf\x81 measurements. "
"Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock, Moller\xe2\x88\x92Plesset, and DFT calculations have been carried out using the 6-31++G** basis set to study the effect of microsolvation on the strength of a typical low-barrier hydrogen bond. In the gas phase, the hydrogen bond formed between a formic acid molecule and a formate anion is approximately 25 kcal/mol, with a calculated energy barrier for proton transfer from the formic acid to the formate anion which is lower than the zero point vibrational energy resonant in the system. When both the formic acid and formate anion are microsolvated, by one water molecule each, the resulting hydrogen bond is actually increased in strength slightly. When the microsolvation is asymmetrical, however, so as to cause a mismatch in the pKa values of the hydrogen bond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor, the resulting H-bond is weakened by approximately 4 kcal/mol. These results suggest that small amounts of interstitial water in enzyme active sites may not preclude the existence or importance of low-barrier hydrogen bonds in such biological catalysts. "
"Small platinum clusters are readily generated by electron ionization of Pt4(PF3)8 in an FT-ICR mass spectrometer. Ptn+ (n = 1\xe2\x88\x924), cluster ions of a given n value may then be isolated and reacted with a variety of gaseous saturated and aromatic cyclic hydrocarbons. The present experiments thus illuminate catalytic dehydrogenation behavior intermediate between that of single-atom and bulk platinum. Extensive chemisorption (dehydrogenation of the hydrocarbon) and physisorption (nondissociative adsorption of intact neutral reagent molecule on the cluster) occur, depending on the particular reagent species. For example, each of the clusters exhibits chemisorption with at least one ligand for every neutral reactant species except for hexafluorobenzene. In general, the extent of chemisorption increases with cluster size. Also, some of the reactions do not proceed by a previously proposed C\xe2\x88\x92H bond insertion mechanism. The detailed reaction pathways and product relative yields depend on the metal cluster ion, the reagent neutral species, and the stability of the final product. "
"High level ab initio calculations at the G2** level of theory have been used to examine the effect of interaction with a series of small neutral molecules (X = He, Ne, Ar, CO, HF, N2, H2O, and NH3) on the barrier for rearrangement of the isoformyl cation (HOC+) to the formyl cation (HCO+). Interaction with species (He, Ne, and Ar) whose proton affinities are less than that of CO at oxygen leads to a reduction in the barrier from the value (147 kJ mol-1) in the isolated system, but the barrier remains positive. Interaction with molecules (HF and N2) whose proton affinities lie between the proton affinities of CO at O and at C leads to the barrier becoming negative, thus allowing proton migration to take place without an overall barrier. Finally, interaction with molecules (H2O and NH3) whose proton affinities are greater than that of CO at C leads to a further lowering of the barrier; however, proton transfer to X rather than proton migration from O to C becomes energetically preferred. The most effective proton-transport catalysts for the rearrangement of HOC+ to HCO+ are thus molecules whose proton affinities lie between those of CO at O and at C. "
"\xce\xb2-Lactamases of classes A and C are believed to have evolved from bacterial enzymes involved in biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan, the so-called penicillin-binding proteins. All these enzymes undergo acylation at an active-site serine by \xce\xb2-lactam antibiotics as a common feature. However, the fate of the acyl-enzyme species is different for \xce\xb2-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins; deacylation is rapid for the former, whereas it is slow for the latter. It is believed that the acquisition of the ability to deacylate the acyl-enzyme intermediate led to the evolution of \xce\xb2-lactamase activity, which is indispensable for the survival of bacteria in the face of challenge by \xce\xb2-lactam antibiotics. The mechanisms of deacylation of acyl-enzyme intermediates for \xce\xb2-lactamases are examined as a means to investigate structural factors in evolutionary descendency of classes A and C of \xce\xb2-lactamases from penicillin-binding proteins. It is known that in class A \xce\xb2-lactamases the hydrolytic water approaches the acyl-enzyme intermediate from the \xce\xb1-face, a process which is promoted by Glu-166 of these enzymes. An approach from the \xce\xb2-face for class C \xce\xb2-lactamase has been proposed. The process of activation of the hydrolytic water is not entirely understood at the present for these enzymes. Two compounds, p-nitrophenyl (2R,5R)-5-prolylacetate (2) and p-nitrophenyl (1S,3S)-3-carboxycyclopentylacetate (3), were synthesized as mechanistic probes to explore whether the hydrolytic water molecule actually approaches the acyl-enzyme species from the \xce\xb2-face and to investigate a notion that the ring amine at the acyl-enzyme intermediate may promote the hydrolytic reaction. Compound 2 acylates the active site serine of the Q908R \xce\xb2-lactamase (a class C enzyme), and the intermediate undergoes deacylation. On the other hand, compound 3 only acylates the active site, and not having the requisite amine in its structure, the intermediate resists deacylation. Both compounds serve as substrates for the class A TEM-1 \xce\xb2-lactamase, as they were expected, since the approach of the hydrolytic water molecule is from the \xce\xb1-face in this enzyme and is not promoted by the substrate itself. We conclude that substrate-assisted catalysis applies for the class C \xce\xb2-lactamases. On the basis of the evidence discussed, the knowledge of the crystal structures for the classes A and C of \xce\xb2-lactamases and the Steptomyces R61 DD-peptidase/transpeptidase (a PBP), it is proposed herein that evolution of classes A and C of \xce\xb2-lactamases from a primordial penicillin-binding protein should have been independent events; hence, the process does not represent a linear descendency of one \xce\xb2-lactamase from the other.

"Photoirradiation of dibenzoyldiazomethane (DBDM) produced highly electrophilic benzoylketene via Wolff rearrangement. DBDM derivative possessing an aminoalkyl side chain induced a DNA cleavage selectively at guanine (G) residues upon photoirradiation and subsequent piperidine treatment. In order to devise photochemical DNA cleavers that can specifically alkylate a guanine residue proximal to the target sequence of long DNA fragments, a new reagent, DBDM-OSu, which facilitates the connection of DBDM unit to various DNA binders, was developed. DBDM-oligonucleotide (ODN) conjugates 5 and 6 were obtained by the coupling of 5\xe2\x80\x98-aminohexyl 8-mer [H2N-(CH2)6-d(ACGTCAGG)-3\xe2\x80\x98] and 15-mer [H2N-(CH2)6-d(ACGTCAGGTGGCACT)-3\xe2\x80\x98], respectively, with DBDM-OSu in aqueous acetonitrile in the presence of sodium bicarbonate. Photoirradiation of 5 and 6 in the presence of 25-mer 5\xe2\x80\x98-d(AGTGCCACCTGACGTCTG18CTCTCTC)-3\xe2\x80\x98 having a complementary sequence induced cross-linking of both oligomers. A distinct cleavage band at guanine residue (G18) was observed upon heating the cross-linked oligomers with piperidine. A similar DNA cleavage reaction of 5\xe2\x80\x98-d(AGTGCCACCTGACG14TG16CG18TG20CG22TCT)-3\xe2\x80\x98 having multiple guanine sites in the presence of DBDM-ODN conjugate 6 indicated that the most effectively cleaved site is G16. These results demonstrated that DBDM-oligonucleotide conjugates can serve as a new class of photonucleases that can cleave single-stranded DNA at predetermined guanine sites. Furthermore, the reagent DBDM-OSu can be used as a convenient and effective photoinducible electrophile for the cross-linking or the modification of biopolymers. "
"A new upper limit of binding site size is defined for the hairpin polyamide-DNA motif. Ten-ring hairpin polyamides containing pyrrole (Py) and imidazole (Im) amino acids were designed for recognition of seven base pair (bp) sequences in the minor groove of DNA. The DNA binding properties of two polyamides, ImPyPyPyPy-\xce\xb3-ImPyPyPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp, and ImImPyPyPy-\xce\xb3-ImPyPyPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp were analyzed by footprinting and affinity cleavage on a DNA fragment containing the respective match sites 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGTAACA-3\xe2\x80\x98 and 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGGAACA-3\xe2\x80\x98. Quantitative footprint titrations demonstrate that ImPyPyPyPy-\xce\xb3-ImPyPyPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp binds the 7-bp match sequence 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGTAACA-3\xe2\x80\x98 with an equilibrium association constant (Ka) of Ka = 1.2 \xc3\x97 1010 M-1 and 18-fold specificity versus the single base pair mismatch sequence 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGGAACA-3\xe2\x80\x98. ImImPyPyPy-\xce\xb3-ImPyPyPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp differs from ImPyPyPyPy-\xce\xb3-ImPyPyPyPy-\xce\xb2-Dp by a single amino acid substitution and binds its match 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGGAACA-3\xe2\x80\x98 site with Ka = 3.6 \xc3\x97 109 M-1 and 300-fold specificity versus its corresponding single base pair mismatch sequence 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGTAACA-3\xe2\x80\x98. Ten-ring hairpin polyamides have binding affinities similar to those of eight-ring hairpin polyamides. These results indicate that the affinity of hairpin binding ceases to increase as the length of the polyamide subunits increases beyond four rings, analogous to the behavior of unlinked subunits. Therefore, recognition of seven base pairs by a ten-ring hairpin polyamide most likely represents an upper limit to the effective targetable site size of the hairpin polyamide-DNA motif. "
"Cyclohexenyl and cyclohexylidene inhibitors possessing strategically placed olefinic residues, in general, bind to 3-dehydroquinate (DHQ) synthase more tightly than similarly substituted cyclohexyl inhibitors. All of the newly synthesized inhibitors were prepared from a common DHQ derivative. Cyclohexenyl phosphate 1 is the most potent inhibitor of DHQ synthase thus far identified with an inhibition constant (Ki = 1.2 \xc3\x97 10-10 M), indicating active site binding 1000-fold tighter relative to the corresponding cyclohexyl phosphate 5. Cyclohexenyl tricarboxylate 2 binds 700-fold more tightly than similarly substituted cyclohexyl tricarboxylate 6 and is the first example of a nanomolar-level inhibitor (Ki = 8.6 \xc3\x97 10-9 M) possessing neither a phosphate monoester nor a phosphonic acid. Cyclohexenyl homophosphonate 4 (Ki = 3.0 \xc3\x97 10-8 M) and cyclohexylidene homophosphonate 10 (Ki = 3.2 \xc3\x97 10-9 M) bind 57- and 530-fold, respectively, more tightly than the corresponding cyclohexyl homophosphonate 8. Cyclohexylidene homophosphonate 10 is the first example of a nanomolar-level, homophosphonic acid inhibitor of DHQ synthase. Cyclohexylidene phosphonate 9 (Ki = 2.9 \xc3\x97 10-10 M) is a 2.9-fold more potent inhibitor relative to cyclohexyl phosphonate 7 which was previously the most potent, slowly-reversible inhibitor of DHQ synthase. Cyclohexenyl phosphonate 3 (Ki = 1.2 \xc3\x97 10-9 M) is the only olefin-containing, carbocyclic inhibitor where improved binding over the corresponding cyclohexyl analogue was not observed. The impact of olefinic residues in inhibitors on active site binding may indicate that DHQ synthase plays an active catalytic role during E1cb elimination of inorganic phosphate from enzyme-bound substrate.

"The nitrenium ions 3a,b derived from hydrolysis of N-(sulfonatooxy)-N-acetyl-4-aminobiphenyl (1a) and N-(4-biphenylyl)-O-pivaloylhydroxylamine (1b) are trapped by the purine nucleosides 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine (dG), guanosine (G), 8-methylguanosine (8-MeG), adenosine (A), inosine (I), and xanthosine (X) with varying degrees of efficiency. Those nucleosides with a basic N-7 (pKa(N7\xe2\x88\x92H+) \xe2\x89\xa5 2.3) react with 3a,b with an apparently diffusion-limited rate constant at 20 \xc2\xb0C of ca. 2.0 \xc3\x97 109 M-1 s-1, determined from the experimental trapping ratios knuc/ks and known values of ks for the two nitrenium ions. All nucleosides with a basic N-7, including 8-MeG, generate only C-8 adducts upon reaction with 3a,b. The reactions of 8-MeG with 3a,b produce metastable adducts, tentatively identified as 16a,b, that decompose over time into the stable 7,8-dihydroguanosine derivatives 8a,b. Our data, and those of other workers, are consistent with a mechanism that involves initial attack of N-7 on the nitrogen of the nitrenium ions followed by a 1,2 migration and deprotonation (Scheme 2b) to yield the final C-8 adducts. Nucleosides with a less basic N-7 react more slowly with the nitrenium ions and also produce adducts other than C-8 adducts. Inosine generates both the C-8 adducts 6a,b and the O-6 adducts 7a,b. Adenosine reacts with 3a,b to produce the unique azabicyclo[4.1.0]hepta-2,4-diene derivatives 11a,b. Plots of log knuc vs pKa(N7\xe2\x88\x92H+) show that the \xce\xb2nuc for C-8 adduct formation is at least 0.7 for purine nucleosides with pKa \xe2\x89\xa4 2.3. The purine and pyrimidine selectivity data conclusively demonstrate that the high abundance of C-8 dG adducts observed in DNA from in vivo or in vitro experiments is a consequence of the high selectivity of nitrenium ions for N-7 of dG. Other minor DNA adducts may be produced as a result of structure-dependent modification of site selectivity. "
"This paper describes the solid-phase syntheses of artificial \xce\xb2-sheets 1\xe2\x88\x924, which mimic the structure and hydrogen-bonding patterns of protein \xce\xb2-sheets. In these compounds, molecular templates induce \xce\xb2-sheet structures in attached peptide strands. The templates consist of di- and triurea derivatives, which hold peptide and peptidomimetic strands in proximity, and \xce\xb2-strand mimics, which hydrogen bond to the peptide strands. The syntheses involve constructing the \xe2\x80\x9clower\xe2\x80\x9d peptide strand on Merrifield resin, attaching the di- or triamine portions of the di- or triurea templates, connecting the \xe2\x80\x9cupper\xe2\x80\x9d peptide and peptidomimetic strands, and cleaving the resulting artificial \xce\xb2-sheets from the resin. The artificial \xce\xb2-sheets were prepared in 8\xe2\x88\x9213 steps from leucine Merrifield in 33\xe2\x88\x9267% overall yield. "
"Thermotropic liquid-crystalline behavior of phosphonium salts, which are structurally simple amphiphiles with positively-charged phosphorus atoms and without rigid cores, was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy, and X-ray diffractometry. The phosphonium salts were found to show a smectic A (SA) phase in which a homeotropic structure was formed spontaneously. It is significant that the phosphonium salts possess an advantageous feature as thermotropic liquid crystals and show a stable liquid-crystalline phase and a simple phase transition behavior in comparison with commonly available ammonium analogs. For example, dimethylditetradecylphosphonium chloride showed the highest SA to isotropic (I) phase transition temperature (TSI, 187 \xc2\xb0C) and the SA phase in the widest temperature range (119 \xc2\xb0C on heating) among the cationic amphiphiles examined in the present study, while dimethylditetradecylammonium chloride with the same structure except the cationic part showed the lowest TSI (70 \xc2\xb0C) and the narrowest liquid-crystalline temperature range (22 \xc2\xb0C on heating).

"The labeling of molecules with charge-transfer dyes, such as 5-(dimethylamino)-1-napthalenesulfonyl (dansyl) chloride, is a powerful tool for examining the solvent shell of attached substances. This investigation describes the synthesis and application of a new charge transfer label, based on trans-1-[p-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenyl]-trans-4-(p-nitrophenyl)-1,3-butadiene (NND). Unlike many commonly used fluorophores, the quantum yield of NND decreases over 4 orders of magnitude upon changing from nonpolar to polar environments. In addition, several derivatives of NND undergo little photodecomposition and can be detected at the picomolar level in a confocal fluorescence correlation spectrometer. In conjunction with recent detection of single molecules in solution, this paper describes a method to discriminate between single free and carbohydrate-bound aggregates of the Jack Bean lectin, concanavalin A (Con A). To this end, two derivatives of NND were constructed possessing an additional functional handle. One derivative, alkenyne 4, was efficiently attached to the \xce\xb2-anomeric position of glucopyranosides. Transients from single aggregates of this fluorophore were detected in solutions which contained both Con A and maltoside 1, and not the corresponding glucoside 2. This result is in agreement with the known affinity of Con A for \xce\xb1-glucopyranosides and not \xce\xb2-glucopyranosides. A full description of the synthesis of these dyes, their solvochromatic properties, and the method used for single aggregate detection is provided herein. "
"A variety of titanium aryloxide reagents catalyze the cross coupling of two alkyne units with 1 equiv of olefin to produce the 1,3-cyclohexadiene nucleus. Catalysts include isolated titanacyclopentadiene or titanacyclopentane complexes. The reaction proceeds via attack of the olefin upon a titanacyclopentadiene compound initially formed by coupling of two alkyne units. The reaction is limited to bulky alkyne substrates that undergo slow catalytic cyclotrimerization via competing attack of a third alkyne upon the titanacyclopentadiene ring. The organic products isolated are typically the result of an isomerization within the initially produced 1,3-cyclohexadiene nucleus. Mechanistic studies show that these isomerization processes occur via sequential, metal-mediated 1,5-hydrogen shifts upon a single face of the six-membered ring, exclusively leading to a cis-stereochemistry within the final products. In the reactions of the diynes RC\xe2\x8b\xaeC(CH2)4C\xe2\x8b\xaeCR (R = Et, SiMe3), coupling with ethylene and \xce\xb1-olefins produces a variety of substituted hexalins. A combination of NMR spectroscopy, photochemistry, and molecular mechanics calculations has been applied to determine the stereochemistry and ground state conformations adopted by the product 1,3-cyclohexadienes and hexalins. The primary and secondary photoproducts obtained from some of these 1,3-cyclohexadiene compounds have been characterized. "
"Pymetrozine (1) was converted to hemiaminal 2 in low to moderate yield by trapping its dianion with oxygen followed by reduction with ferrous salts. Pymetrozines 18 and 19 failed to undergo this type of oxygenation. All three pymetrozines were oxidized electrochemically at C5 to methyl hemiaminals 20, 21, and 22, respectively. Hydrolysis of 20 to 2 was accomplished under either acid- or base-catalyzed conditions in excellent yields, whereas the hydrolysis of methyl hemiaminals 21 and 22 was best performed under basic conditions. Soil metabolites of pymetrozine 1, hemiaminals 2 and 3, were prepared on a medium scale and in excellent yields. Linear sweep voltammetry data and conditions for preparative-scale electrochemistry are furnished for the precursory pymetrozines. Complete experimental and spectral data are provided for all new compounds, and the relative merits of anionic versus electrochemical oxidations for alkyl amides are discussed. A cautionary note is provided with the description of the conditions for large-scale anionic oxygenation because of potential explosive hazards. "
"The calorimetric titration of H3PW12O40 (H3PW) with a series of bases in CH3CN gives equilibrium constants and enthalpies for the three deprotonation steps. These results show that solutions of H3PW in any solvent whose basicity is equal to or weaker than CH3CN will only furnish one strong proton per molecule of acid for stoichiometric or catalytic reactions. In more strongly basic solvents (S), more S2H+ species are available, but their strength is less being leveled by the solvent basicity. In drying H3PW, it is critical to avoid the weaker acids formed by reducing the material or forming the anhydride. Calorimetric titration of a series of samples subjected to different drying procedures establishes the best procedure for preparing the anhydrous acid. For most donors, the enthalpies of reaction for the first protonation step fit the ECW model. The W term provides a measure of the dissociation energy of the conjugate base in acetonitrile. EA* and CA* permit calculation of the enthalpies for the reaction in acetonitrile of (CH3CN)H+ and H3PW with the >100 bases in the ECW correlation. The CA*/EA* ratio of 2.88 indicates significant covalency in the interactions of this acceptor. This fitting of the enthalpies by using solvation minimized, donor parameters for neutral adducts indicates that the choice of enthalpies in acetonitrile as the solvent provides a temperature-independent, solution, Br\xc3\xb6nsted acidity scale that permits comparisons with neutral acceptors. The enthalpies of reactions of pyridine with a series of Br\xc3\xb6nsted acids in acetonitrile solvent is offered, leading to the following acidity order:\xe2\x80\x89 H3PW12O40 > CF3SO3H > p-CH3C6H4SO3H \xe2\x89\x85 H2SO4 > CF3COOH > ClC6H4COOH.

"Styrene derivatives of the manganese tricabonyl cation have been synthesized through the reaction of Mn(CO)5BF4 with excess styrene derivatives in refluxing CH2Cl2, and their chemical reduction has been studied. Treatment of [(styrene)Mn(CO)3]+ (1(H)) with 1.0 equiv of Cp2Co in CH2Cl2 or THF led to isolation of bimetallic 2(H). Treatment of [(1,1-diphenylethylene)Mn(CO)3]+ (1(Ph)) with 1.0 equiv of Cp2Co in CH2Cl2 yielded three different bimetallic compounds, 2(Ph), 3(Ph), and 4(Ph). The molecular structures of 2(H), 2(Ph), 3(Ph), and 4(Ph), determined by X-ray crystallography, were quite different from those of known bimetallics. Compounds 2(H) and 2(Ph) have the \xce\xb75:\xce\xb73 bonding pattern, where a Mn(CO)4 moiety is coordinated to the styrene in an \xce\xb73-fashion. Compound 3(Ph) has the \xce\xb75:\xce\xb75 boding pattern with two Mn(CO)3 moieties \xcf\x80-coordinated to a ligand derived from a coupling of 1,1-diphenylethylenes through the ipso carbon atom. Compound 4(Ph) has a metal\xe2\x88\x92metal bond with no bridging carbonyls; one of the manganese atoms is coordinated by 1,1-diphenylethylene and two carbonyls and the other by the Mn(CO)5. There are multiple reduction pathways available to (arene)Mn(CO)3 + cations having a vinyl substituent on the arene ring. "
"A series of neutral Ir(I) complexes IrLL\xe2\x80\x98(Et2dtc) (L = L\xe2\x80\x98 = CO PPh3, P(OPh)3; L = CO, L\xe2\x80\x98 = PPh3; L + L\xe2\x80\x98 = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 1,2-bis(di(pentafluorophenyl)phosphino)ethane; Et2dtc = N,N\xe2\x80\x98-diethyldithiocarbamate) has been synthesized and characterized by NMR, IR, and electronic spectroscopies. The complexes show spectra consistent with a four-coordinate structure. A distorted square planar coordination geometry is confirmed by a single crystal structure determination of Ir(CO)(PPh3)(Et2dtc) (3). Yellow-orange crystals of 3 (C24H25IrNOPS2) are monoclinic, space group P21/n (no. 14), with a = 15.641(12) \xc3\x85, b = 9.252(3) \xc3\x85, c = 17.119(14) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 111.42(3)\xc2\xb0, V = 2395.00 \xc3\x853, Z = 4, and final R = 0.029 (Rw = 0.031) for 3204 unique reflections. All of the complexes exhibit emission in the solid state and in frozen glass media at 77 K. Additionally, Ir(CO)(PPh3)(Et2dtc), Ir(dppe)(Et2dtc), and Ir(P(OPh)3)2(Et2dtc) display emission in methylene chloride solutions at room temperature. The bis triphenylphosphite complex, Ir(P(OPh3)2)(Et2dtc), undergoes intramolecular C\xe2\x88\x92H activation in benzene solution to form the ortho-metalated A benzene solution of Ir(CO)(PPh3)(Et2dtc) reacts readily with H2, forming several different dihydride products having the formula IrH2(CO)(PPh3)(Et2dtc), including an isomer with a kinetic preference for formation of 170:1 as determined using parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) at 300 K. A method is described for observing the 13C resonance of the carbonyl ligand in submilligram samples of IrH2(PPh3)(CO)(Et2dtc) in under 2 min. The ligand exchange reactions of the two parahydrogen active isomers are also examined. PHIP is also observed in H2 oxidative addition to Ir((C6F5)2PCH2CH2P(C6F5)2)(Et2dtc). Benzene solutions of Ir(CO)(PPh3)(Et2dtc) and Ir(dppe)(Et2dtc) react with molecular oxygen to form the stable adducts Ir(O2)(CO)(PPh3)(Et2dtc) and Ir(O2)(dppe)(Et2dtc), respectively, and both lose O2 upon irradiation only. The complex Ir(CO)(PPh3)(Et2dtc) oxidatively adds CH3I to form the trans addition product Ir(CH3)(CO)(I)(PPh3)(Et2dtc). "
"Free-standing ultrathin films of a porphyrin homopolymer have been synthesized by interfacial polymerization of a mercaptoporphyrin. Coupling of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(\xce\xb1-mercapto-p-tolyl)porphyrin at the water/chloroform interface by copper acetate yields continuous, flexible films after drying with supercritical CO2. These films are amorphous and retain many characteristics of the monomeric porphyrin, such as the property that they may be metalated. Spectroscopic evidence suggests efficient cross-linking of thiols through disulfide coupling occurs in these polyporphyrins to form a network. Polymerization is accompanied by the introduction of carbonyl functionality, probably the transformation of residual thiols to thioacetate by metal-mediated reaction with excess acetate ion. As an example of the catalytic properties of these polymers, they are shown to promote photooxidation of thietane to the corresponding sulfoxide by sensitizing singlet oxygen production. "
"The complex Cp*Rh(PMe3)H2 (Cp* = C5Me5) reacts with C6F6, C6F5H, C12F10, or C10F8 in pyridine or 1:1 pyridine/benzene to give the C\xe2\x88\x92F cleavage products Cp*Rh(PMe3)(arylF)H in high yield. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction has autocatalytic character, and fluoride ion is shown to be responsible for the catalysis. The anion [Cp*Rh(PMe3)H]- reacts rapidly with C12F10 or C10F8 to give the same C\xe2\x88\x92F cleavage products as Cp*Rh(PMe3)H2. A mechanism initiated by deprotonation of Cp*Rh(PMe3)H2 followed by nucleophilic attack of the resulting anion on the polyfluoroaromatic with subsequent loss of fluoride is proposed. The fluoride ion continues the cycle by deprotonating Cp*Rh(PMe3)H2. "
"Ketyl radical anions with a halogen substitutent on the carbon adjacent to ketyl are known to rapidly rearrange by halide anion ejection. Such a rearrangement is an ideal probe for possible ketyl radical anion intermediates in the catalytic mechanism of the monocopper/tyrosine radical enzyme galactose oxidase (GOase). Turnover of \xce\xb2-fluoro-, \xce\xb2-chloro-, \xce\xb2-bromo-, and \xce\xb2-iodoethanol by GOase leads to mechanism-based inactivation of the enzyme by trapping the enzyme in a catalytically inactive one-electron-reduced form. Presuming that mechanism-based inactivation and turnover proceed through the same reactive intermediates, the data reported here narrow down the possible mechanisms for the substrate oxidation step (the two electron transfer from substrate to enzyme) to two similar possibilities. Either the reaction proceeds through a short-lived ketyl radical anion intermediate or it proceeds through a closely related concerted E2R mechanism with considerable ketyl radical anion character in the transition state.

"Deamination of 7-(Me3N)-nido-7,8,9-C3B8H10 (1a) leads either to the parent tricarbollide anion [nido-7,8,9-C3B8H11]- (2-) or to the neutral tricarbaborane nido-7,8,9-C3B8H12 (2a), together with a small amount of 8-Me-nido-7,8,9-C3B8H11 (2b). Di- and trisubstituted derivatives of 2a, 7-(ButMeN)-10-Me-nido-7,8,9-C3B8H10 (2c), and 7-(ButMeN)-10,11-Me2-nido-7,8,9- C3B8H9 (2d) were obtained as byproducts from the methylation of both 7-(ButNH2)-nido-7,8,9-C3B8H10 (1b) and 7-(ButMeNH)-nido-7,8,9- C3B8H10 (1c) with MeI in THF under reflux. Heating of 1a and 2- at 350 \xc2\xb0C resulted in the rearrangement of the carbons on the open-face to give high yields of the isomeric tricarbollides 10-(Me3N)-nido-7,8,10-C3B8H10 (3a) and [nido-7,8,10-C3B8H11]- (4-), respectively. The structure of 3a was determined by an X-ray diffraction analysis, and the geometries of the parent compounds 2-, 2a, and 4- were optimized at the ab initio MP2(fc)/6-31G* level. The structures of all compounds also were secured by the excellent agreement between the experimental data and the IGLO/NMR calculations of the 11B chemical shifts for the parent compounds at the DZ//6-31G*, DZ//MP2/6-31G*, and II\xe2\x80\x98//MP2/6-31G* levels.

"We describe the preparation and structural characterization of carbon-supported Pt\xe2\x88\x92Ru nanoparticles with exceptionally narrow size and compositional distributions. The supported bimetallic particles are obtained by reduction of the neutral molecular carbonyl cluster precursor PtRu5C(CO)16 with hydrogen. A detailed structural model of the nanoparticles has been deduced on the basis of studies by in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), scanning transmission electron microscopy, microprobe energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and electron microdiffraction. These experiments show that the bimetallic nanoparticles have a Pt:Ru composition of 1:5 and an average diameter of ca. 1.5 nm and adopt a face-centered cubic closest packing structure. These results demonstrate a marked sensitivity of the metal particle structure to nanoscale size effects inasmuch as the thermodynamically stable phase for bulk alloys of this composition is hexagonal close-packed. The local metal coordination environment, revealed by multiple scattering analysis of the EXAFS data, shows the presence of a nonstatistical distribution of different metal atoms in the nanoparticles. Specifically, Pt shows a marked preference for segregation to the particle surfaces under an ambient H2 atmosphere. Oxidation of the alloy particle in O2 produces an outer metal oxide layer surrounding a metal-only core. This oxidation is easily reversed by exposing the nanoparticles to H2 at room temperature. "
"The photoelectron spectrum of the dehydrocyclooctatetraene negative ion, C8H6-, is reported. The spectrum strongly resembles that previously reported for the cyclooctatetraene anion, indicating that the structure of C8H6- is very similar to that of C8H8-. Two electronic states of dehydrocyclooctatetraene are observed in the photoelectron spectrum. The lowest energy feature is assigned to singlet 1,3,5-cyclooctatrien-7-yne, while the higher energy band corresponds to a triplet state of dehydrocyclooctatetraene. The electron affinity of C8H6 is found to be 1.044 \xc2\xb1 0.008 eV, and the energy difference between the singlet and triplet states is 0.708 \xc2\xb1 0.006 eV. Vibrational activity is observed in the photoelectron spectrum and assigned using a simple potential energy surface. Stretching of the triple bond in cyclooctatrienyne is found to have a frequency of 2185 cm-1, essentially what is expected for a triple bond within an eight-membered ring. Ab initio and density functional molecular orbital calculations on dehydrocyclooctatetraene and the corresponding ions are reported. Cyclooctatrienyne is calculated to have a planar or pseudoplanar structure, consistent with assignments based on peak widths in the photoelectron spectrum. "
"Photoinduced electron transfer reactions are characterized in supramolecular assemblies consisting of a series of Ru(II)\xe2\x88\x92bipyridine complexes that include tethered dialkoxybenzene units 2\xe2\x88\x925 and cyclo[bis(N,N\xe2\x80\x98-p-xylylene-4,4\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridinium)], BXV4+ (1). Formation of supramolecular complexes between BXV4+ and the dialkoxybenzene \xcf\x80-donor sites, linked to the photosensitizers, yields effective electron transfer quenching in the non-covalent-bound dyads and polyads. Steady-state luminescence quenching experiments and time-resolved studies reveal that for the one-shell photosensitizers 3 and 5 that include six and two dialkoxybenzene units, respectively, supramolecular photosensitizer-BXV4+ assemblies of maximal stoichiometries corresponding to six and two, respectively, coexist with lower supramolecular stoichiometries and free photosensitizers in the systems. For the two-shell dialkoxybenzene-tethered photosensitizers 2 and 4 that include 12 and 4 \xcf\x80-donor binding sites, respectively, supramolecular assemblies with BXV4+ of maximal stoichiometries corresponding to 6 and 2 are derived. The association constant of BXV4+ to the functionalized branch of the two-shell photosensitizer is ca. 10-fold higher than that of the one-shell photosensitizer. The higher affinity of the two-shell photosensitizers to form supramolecular complexes with BXV4+ is attributed to the cooperative participation of two dialkoxybenzene sites in the association of one BXV4+ unit. The higher association constants of BXV4+ to the two-shell photosensitizers 2 and 4, yields improved electron transfer quenching as compared to the one-shell chromophores 3 and 5. The photogenerated redox-products formed in the supramolecular assemblies Ru3+\xe2\x88\x92bipyridine and BXV\xe2\x80\xa23+, recombine within the non-covalent-bound structures without dissociation. The back electron transfer rate of the photogenerated redox products in the dyads and polyads is relatively slow due to their spatial separation by repulsive electrostatic interactions. "
"Optical switching behavior of low-molecular-weight and polymer azobenzene liquid crystals (LCs) was explored by means of reflection-mode analysis. Reflectivity changed on pulse irradiation under various conditions of orientations of LC molecules with respect to incident probe light, either s-polarization or p-polarization. For the low-molecular-weight LCs, we obtained a response time of 100 \xce\xbcs, which was very similar to that observed in the transmission-mode analysis, while we observed a decay time of 1 ms, which was significantly shorter than that observed in the transmission-mode analysis. The fast decay may be due to diffusion and reorientation processes which are characteristic of the reflection-mode analysis. For the polymer LCs, we observed a much slower decay than those for the low-molecular-weight LCs. "
"The utility of carbonyl carbons as probes of internal mobility in proteins is investigated by theoretical and experimental methods. In a double 13C,15N-labeled sample, the relaxation of the carbonyl carbon is mediated by dipolar interactions with nearby protons, the 13C\xce\xb1 and 15N nuclei, and the 13C chemical shielding anisotropy (CSA). Expressions are presented for carbonyl single-spin, carbonyl-nitrogen, and carbonyl-\xce\xb1-carbon two-spin rates due to dipolar interaction and a CSA tensor. We show that, at high magnetic fields, useful relations between relaxation rates and spectral density functions can be derived, because the CSA autocorrelation dominates carbonyl relaxation. Proton-detected 13C,15N NMR spectroscopy is used to measure one-spin carbonyl and two-spin carbonyl-nitrogen relaxation rates. Measurements are performed at 9.4, 11.7, and 17.6 T for carbonyl carbons in villin 14T, the N-terminal 14 kDa domain of the actin-binding protein villin. Three rate measurements are used to obtain the values of the spectral density function at zero [J(0)], nitrogen [J(\xcf\x89N)], and carbonyl [J(\xcf\x89C)] frequencies. The different secondary structural elements such as \xce\xb1-helices, \xce\xb2-sheets, and regions of low persistent structure have distinctive dynamic behavior that the values of the spectral density function at low frequencies (<75 MHz) reveal. The value of J(0) is especially sensitive to both rapid and slow internal motions and is discussed in detail. Comparison with 15N-only data indicates that one can obtain similar dynamic information from the carbonyl data. In addition, carbonyl NMR studies are potentially useful for probing hydrogen-bond dynamics, as significantly different average J(0) values were observed for hydrogen-bonded and solvent-exposed carbonyls.

"Nitric oxide reductase from the denitrifying fungus Fusarium oxysporum catalyzes the reduction of NO to N2O [Nakahara, K., et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1993, 268, 8350\xe2\x88\x928355]. Since this enzyme belongs to the cytochrome P450 superfamily [Kizawa, H., et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1991, 266, 10632\xe2\x88\x9210637], it is called cytochrome P450nor (P450nor), but does not exhibit monooxygenation activity. In the present study, we examine the coordination structure of the heme iron in P450nor in the ferric-NO form by using infrared, resonance Raman, and X-ray absorption (EXAFS = extended X-ray absorption fine structure) spectroscopies, since the ferric-NO complex is a first intermediate in the NO reduction cycle by P450nor [Shiro, Y, et al J. Biol. Chem. 1995, 270, 1617\xe2\x88\x921623]. We compared the data obtained with those for the d-camphor-bound form of Pseudomonas putida camphor hydroxylase cytochrome P450cam (P450cam), a typical model of the monooxygenase. From the vibrational spectroscopic measurements, we found that the Fe-bound N\xe2\x88\x92O stretching frequency (\xce\xbd(N\xe2\x88\x92O)) occurred at 1851 cm-1 and the Fe\xe2\x88\x92NO stretching frequency (\xce\xbd(Fe\xe2\x88\x92NO)) at 530 cm-1 for P450nor, while those at 1806 and 522 cm-1 were observed for P450cam, respectively. The assignments were confirmed by the 15NO substituting effect on these vibrational frequencies. These results indicated that NO binds to the ferric iron in P450nor stronger than in P450cam. Support for this was provided from the EXAFS study, which gave an Fe\xe2\x88\x92NNO bond distance of 1.66 \xc2\xb1 0.02 \xc3\x85 for P450nor and 1.76 \xc2\xb1 0.02 \xc3\x85 for P450cam. These spectroscopic results suggest that, compared with P450cam, the lower steric hindrance and/or the difference in the electrostatic interactions of the ligand NO with its surroundings facilitates the donation of the NO 2p\xcf\x80* electron to the iron 3d\xcf\x80 orbital, resulting in the strengthening of the Fe\xe2\x88\x92NO and the N\xe2\x88\x92O bonds of P450nor. The vibrational spectral observation of the ferrous-CO complex of P450nor supported this suggestion. This configuration can reduce the electron density on the NO ligand in P450nor, which is seemingly relevant to the NO reduction reactivity of P450nor. "
"To promote the development of boron-containing purine analogues that exist in planar, non-zwitterionic dominant structural form in aqueous solution, rigorous solution and solid state structural analyses of 1-hydroxy-1H-2,3,1-benzoxazaborine (1), 1,2-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2,3,1-benzodiazaborine (2), and related 2,3,1-benzodiheteraborines were undertaken. With the aid of isotope-enriched compounds, a multisolvent 1H, 13C, 11B, and 15N NMR spectroscopic analysis of 1 and 2 was conducted, providing structurally-diagnostic chemical shift data for all non-oxygen atoms that constitute their heterocyclic peripheries. In addition, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses of 1 and 2 were performed. In stark contrast to their 2,4,1 isomeric counterparts, the 2,3,1-benzoxaza- and benzodiazaborines exist in planar structural form in protic solution and in the solid state and display proton dissociative and associative tendencies reflective of the predominant Br\xc3\xb8nsted, yet still Lewis acidic-capable character of the B-OH group together with the basic one at the C4\xe2\x88\x92N3 imine group. In the solid state, 1 and 2 display intermolecular hydrogen-bonding patterns not too dissimilar from the motifs of certain natural nucleic acid bases. Diazaborine 2 was shown by VT-NMR to undergo a triple hydrogen-bonding solution association with a 2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-tri-O-protected cytidine in a demonstration of one biomimetic potential held by a 1-hydroxy-2,3,1-diheteraborine periphery. In general, 1, 2, and related 1-hydroxy-2,3,1-benzodiheteraborine heterocycles were found to be characterized by an environment-dependent O1\xe2\x86\x92N3 Br\xc3\xb8nsted prototropy and B\xe2\x88\x92OH group Br\xc3\xb8nsted/Lewis acid ambidency so sensitive and subtle that certain past difficulties encountered in attempts to delineate their physicochemical properties now become readily appreciated.

"A simple method for the determination of backbone dihedral angles in peptides and proteins is presented. The chemical-shift anisotropies (CSA) of the central alanine \xce\xb1-carbon in powdered crystalline tripeptides, whose structures have been determined previously by X-ray crystallography, were measured by cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance. The experimental CSA values were correlated with ab initio chemical-shielding calculations over Ramanchandran \xcf\x86/\xcf\x88 space on an N-formyl-l-alanine amide fragment. Using this correlation, \xcf\x86/\xcf\x88 probability surfaces for one of the tripeptides were calculated based only on the \xce\xb1-carbon CSA, allowing a prediction of backbone angles. Dihedral angles predicted by these calculations fall within \xc2\xb112\xc2\xb0 of the values determined by crystallography. This approach should be useful in the determination of solid-state protein structure. "
"1H NMR based on the CRAMPS technique has been used to identify and monitor the protons of surface Al\xe2\x88\x92OH groups and \xe2\x80\x9cphysisorbed\xe2\x80\x9d water associated with a high-surface-area (230 m2/g) pseudo-boehmite material following dehydration in the 110\xe2\x88\x921100 \xc2\xb0C temperature range. Three distinguishable 1H CRAMPS peaks were identified:\xe2\x80\x89 a broad peak at 4.0 \xc2\xb1 0.2 ppm attributed to the protons of \xe2\x80\x9cphysisorbed\xe2\x80\x9d water and two peaks at 8.2 \xc2\xb1 0.3 and 2.3 \xc2\xb1 0.2 ppm associated with the protons of structural Al\xe2\x88\x92OH groups. The 1H CRAMPS results are interpreted in relationship to two important regions of the experimental dehydration weight-loss profile for this material, a lower temperature region (110\xe2\x88\x92300 \xc2\xb0C), in which desorption of \xe2\x80\x9cphysisorbed\xe2\x80\x9d water occurs, and an intermediate temperature region (350\xe2\x88\x92550 \xc2\xb0C), where condensation of adjacent Al\xe2\x88\x92OH groups occurs. The combination of heating between 110 and 300 \xc2\xb0C and room temperature evacuation were found to eliminate the \xe2\x80\x9cphysisorbed\xe2\x80\x9d water peak, permitting the observation of the two resonances associated with the structural Al\xe2\x88\x92OH sites. Dipolar dephasing experiments indicate that the 8.2 ppm peak is associated with highly coupled, \xe2\x80\x9cclustered\xe2\x80\x9d Al2OH groups, while the 3.0 ppm resonance is associated with terminal, \xe2\x80\x9cisolated\xe2\x80\x9d AlOH groups. 1H CRAMPS evidence shows that upon heat treatment the Al2OH groups condense at lower temperatures (350 \xc2\xb0C) than the AlOH groups (550 \xc2\xb0C). Three mechanisms are proposed for the condensation of the proton-containing surface Al\xe2\x88\x92OH groups that occur in this material, based on crystalline boehmite as a structural model. In addition to 1H CRAMPS studies, 27Al MAS NMR spectra at 14 T of samples dehydrated from 100 to 1100 \xc2\xb0C provide structural information about the aluminums in the high-surface-area pseudo-boehmite. This material dehydrates by condensation of both Al2OH and AlOH groups to form distorted, hydrogen-bearing 4-, 5-, and 6-coordinate aluminum-containing intermediates in the 350\xe2\x88\x92500 \xc2\xb0C range. At 1100 \xc2\xb0C, this hydrogen-bearing \xce\xb3- or \xce\xb4-alumina material is converted to a material consisting of primarily \xce\xb1-Al2O3. "
"Details of the hydration and water exchange mechanism of Zn2+ have been studied using density functional calculations with a variety of different basis sets. The computed structures and hydration energies for complexes of the type [Zn(H2O)n]2+ with n = 1\xe2\x88\x926 are in good agreement with previous results obtained from ab initio calculations and self-consistent reaction field methods. Extension of our investigations to the second coordination (first solvation) sphere and thus to complexes of the general type [Zn(H2O)n]2+\xc2\xb7mH2O with n = 5 and m = 1, 2 and n = 6 and m = 1 reveals two types of complexes having either one or two hydrogen bonds between first and second sphere water molecules. The water exchange mechanism of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ is analyzed on the basis of the structures and energies of these complexes. Within the variations due to the different basis sets employed, the Zn\xe2\x88\x92O bond length for water molecules in the first coordination sphere is between 2.0 and 2.1 \xc3\x85, water molecules in the second coordination sphere between 3.6 and 4.1 \xc3\x85 and at the frontier of both spheres between 2.7 and 3.0 \xc3\x85. Within the limitations of the present model, in which bulk water, counterions, and more than one exchanging water molecule have not been considered, a limiting dissociative (D) mechanism for the water exchange reaction on [Zn(H2O)6]2+ is suggested. On the basis of the most reliable structures (i.e., those that could be verified with all levels of theory), the energy of activation for the water exchange is between 4.2 and 4.6 kcal/mol, depending on the basis set employed. A transition state for the interchange mechanism could not be localized. All optimizations invariably led to transition state structures that indicate a limiting D mechanism. "
"Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to model the aqueous solvation of the nonreducing sugar \xce\xb1,\xce\xb1-trehalose. The anisotropic structuring of water around the trehalose molecule was calculated in a Cartesian coordinate frame fixed with respect to the sugar molecule by averaging water positions over the trajectories and was plotted in two and three dimensions relative to the sugar. The hydrogen bonding of this sugar to solvent was calculated and compared to other sugar solutes. Hydration was required to produce the experimental conformation, through the exchange of an internal hydrogen bond for similar bonds to solvent. This equilibrium conformation was found to impose extensive structuring on the adjacent solvent, with structuring extending out to at least the third \xe2\x80\x9csolvation shell\xe2\x80\x9d, while pure liquid water exhibits such structure only in its nearest neighbors. The details of the structuring are determined by both the specific stereochemical topology of the molecule and its conformation, with considerable interplay between conformation and solvent structure. The effect of solute flexibility on the application of this solvent density mapping technique was also examined. While the extensive solvent structural perturbation induced by the solute suggests why the sugars in general are useful antidessicants and cryoprotectants, trehalose does not appear from these results to be unique in its solvation properties. In addition, the results are consistent with the suggestion that much of the effectiveness of trehalose could result from its direct binding to biological membranes and proteins rather than from unique solution properties.

"Polyamides containing N-methylimidazole (Im) and N-methylpyrrole (Py) amino acids can be combined in antiparallel side-by-side dimeric complexes for sequence-specific recognition in the minor groove of DNA. Covalently linking polyamide subunits has led to designed ligands with both increased affinity and specificity. Simple aliphatic amino acid linkers serve as internal guide residues for turn vs extended binding in a head-to-tail-linked polyamide motif. Polyamides of sequence composition ImPyPy-X-PyPyPy containing linkers of incremental length (X = 3-aminopropionic acid (\xce\xb2), 4-aminobutyric acid (\xce\xb3), or 5-aminovaleric acid (\xce\xb4)) in complex with an undecamer DNA duplex containing a 5\xe2\x80\x98-(A,T)G(A,T)3-3\xe2\x80\x98 target site were structurally characterized using NMR spectroscopy. Previous quantitative DNase I footprinting studies identified \xce\xb3 as the highest affinity of these \xe2\x80\x9cturn\xe2\x80\x9d linkers. NMR titrations and 2D NOESY data combined with restrained molecular modeling reveal that polyamides with \xce\xb2, \xce\xb3, and \xce\xb4 linkers all may adopt a hairpin structure. Modeling supports the idea that the linkers in the \xce\xb2 and \xce\xb4 complexes adopt an energetically less favorable turn geometry than the \xce\xb3 linker and confirms that the three-carbon \xce\xb3 linker is sufficient and optimal for the hairpin conformation.

"The synthesis of defined arrays of polypeptide analogues in conjunction with a simple self-encoded chemical readout system provides a powerful method for the systematic investigation of the relationship between polypeptide molecular structure and function. A novel solid-phase synthesis procedure was used to prepare arrays of polypeptide analogues in which a specific modification was systematically incorporated into a unique position in a peptide sequence. The synthesis was carried out in such a way that the resulting arrays contained a defined family of modified peptides, with each peptide molecule containing only a single specific modification. The array of polypeptide analogues was self-encoded in a positional fashion by incorporating a selectively cleavable bond into the analogue structure. Following cleavage of the polypeptide analogue array, analysis of the resulting peptide fragments by MALDI mass spectrometry defined, in a single step, the presence and identity of each peptide analogue in the mixture. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by the synthesis and mass spectrometric readout of an array of nine analogues of the 58-residue polypeptide chain of the cCrk N-terminal SH3 domain, before and after folding and affinity selection.

"The unambiguous stereochemical assignment of the V/W-ring juncture of maitotoxin, as shown in Figure 1, was accomplished using a two-step approach:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) the synthesis of two diastereomeric models Me-A and Me-B and (2) the comparison of the NMR spectroscopic data for each model with those of maitotoxin. Furthermore, the fact that the NMR characteristics observed for Me-A were remarkably close to those reported for maitotoxin makes a strong case for the accurate extrapolation of the conformational properties of maitotoxin from those of the model Me-A. Using 1H\xe2\x88\x921H NOESY experiments and MM3 calculations, the solution conformations of Me-A and Me-B were studied in aprotic and protic solvents. In aprotic solvents such as benzene, both Me-A and Me-B preferentially adopt the conformations Me-Aa and Me-Ba, respectively, due to intramolecular hydrogen bond stabilization. On the other hand, in a protic solvent such as a 1:1 mixture of methanol and pyridine both Me-A and Me-B exist as mixtures of all of their possible rotamers. "
"A rhodium(II) porphyrin bimetalloradical complex, \xe2\x80\xa2Rh(CH2)6Rh\xe2\x80\xa2 (1) reacts with CO and ethene to form an ethanedionyl reductive coupling product, Rh(CH2)6Rh(\xce\xbc-C(O)C(O)) (2), and an ethylene-bridged complex, Rh(CH2)6Rh(\xce\xbc-CH2CH2) (4), respectively. Reaction of 1 with 1,3-butadiene proceeds by a 1,4-addition to yield a four-carbon-bridged complex, Rh(CH2)6Rh(\xce\xbc-CH2CHCHCH2) (5). 1H NMR spectra of 2 and 4 manifest the inherent chirality of two-carbon-bridged tethered diporphyrin complexes. Solutions of 1 and CO react with H2O, CH3CH2OH, and H2 to produce multifunctionalized formyl complexes HRh(CH2)6RhCHO (6), H(O)CRh(CH2)6RhC(O)OCH2CH3 (7), and H(O)CRh(CH2)6RhCHO (8), respectively, but fail to react to an observable extent with methane. Reactivity studies indicate that solutions of 1 and CO function as a source of a species that contains two carbonyl groups (\xe2\x80\xa2[OCRh(CH2)6RhCO]\xe2\x80\xa2) (3) that are activated toward one-electron reactions at the carbonyl carbon. Reactions of 3 with substrates (H2O, C2H5OH, H2) are discussed in terms of a proposed pathway where two metalloformyl radicals ([MCO]\xe2\x80\xa2) and the substrate occur in a four-centered transition state (RhC(O)\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7A\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7B\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xe2\x80\xa2(O)CRh).

"A series of steroids has been studied in which there is a dimethylphenylsiloxy (DPSO) group at the 3 position to serve as a light-absorbing antenna, a ketone group at C6 or C11 to serve as an energy \xe2\x80\x9crelay\xe2\x80\x9d or as a \xe2\x80\x9csinglet\xe2\x88\x92triplet switch\xe2\x80\x9d, and an olefin at C17 to serve as a triplet energy acceptor. These include 3\xce\xb1-(dimethylphenylsiloxy)-17-(Z)-ethylidene-5\xce\xb1-androstan-11-one (2), its C6 carbonyl analog (3), and the C6 ketone 3\xce\xb2 isomer (4). The nonketonic steroid 3\xce\xb1-(dimethylphenylsiloxy)-17-(Z)-ethylidene-5\xce\xb1-androstane (1) serves as a reference. Excitation of all four compounds with light absorbed by the DPSO chromophore leads to Z \xe2\x86\x92 E isomerization of the C17 ethylidene group. For the ketonic steroids this isomerization involves intramolecular singlet\xe2\x88\x92singlet energy transfer (intraSSET) from the DPSO group to the carbonyl group, intersystem crossing to the carbonyl triplet, and intramolecular triplet\xe2\x88\x92triplet energy transfer (intraTTET) to the alkene. For compound 1 there is modestly efficient (through-bond) intraTTET directly from C3 to C17. For 2\xe2\x88\x924 intraSSET is ca. 75\xe2\x88\x9290% efficient and occurs with rate constants of (1.1\xe2\x88\x921.7) \xc3\x97 109 s-1. The C3 DPSO antenna transfers both singlet and triplet energy more efficiently when it is \xce\xb1 (axial) than when it is \xce\xb2 (equatorial). IntraTTET from C6 and C11 to C17 is ca. 80% efficient; kC6\xe2\x86\x9217Z, determined from triplet quenching experiments, equals 8.3 \xc3\x97 108 s-1. The C11 ketone has an unusually short singlet lifetime (0.4 ns), which can be attributed to an enhanced rate of radiationless decay caused by the proximity of the C19 angular methyl group. "
"Hen egg-white lysozyme has long been the paradigm for enzymatic glycosyl hydrolysis with retention of configuration, with a protonated carboxylic acid and a deprotonated carboxylate participating in general acid\xe2\x88\x92base catalysis. In marked contrast, the retaining chitin degrading enzymes from glycosyl hydrolase families 18 and 20 all have a single glutamic acid as the catalytic acid but lack a nucleophile on the enzyme. Both families have a catalytic (\xce\xb2\xce\xb1)8-barrel domain in common. X-ray structures of three different chitinolytic enzymes complexed with substrates or inhibitors identify a retaining mechanism involving a protein acid and the carbonyl oxygen atom of the substrate\'s C2 N-acetyl group as the nucleophile. These studies unambiguously demonstrate the distortion of the sugar ring toward a sofa conformation, long postulated as being close to that of the transition state in glycosyl hydrolysis. "
"The olefin metathesis approach to epothilone A (1) and several analogues (39\xe2\x88\x9241, 42\xe2\x88\x9244, 51\xe2\x88\x9257, 58\xe2\x88\x9260, 64\xe2\x88\x9265, and 67\xe2\x88\x9269) is described. Key building blocks 6\xe2\x88\x928 were constructed in optically active form and were coupled and elaborated to olefin metathesis precursor 4 via an aldol reaction and an esterification coupling. Olefin metathesis of compound 4, under the catalytic influence of RuCl2(CHPh)(PCy3)2, furnished cis- and trans-cyclic olefins 3 and 48. Epoxidation of 49 gave epothilone A (1) and several analogues, whereas epoxidation of 50 resulted in additional epothilones. Similar elaboration of isomeric as well as simpler intermediates resulted in yet another series of epothilone analogues and model systems. "
"The total syntheses of epothilones A (1) and B (2) and several analogues thereof are described. The reported strategy relies on a macrolactonization approach and features selective epoxidation of the macrocycle double bond in precursors 3 and 4 (Scheme 1), respectively, as well as high convergency and flexibility. Building blocks 9\xe2\x88\x9212 and 15 were constructed by asymmetric processes and coupled via Wittig, aldol, and macrolactonization reactions to afford the basic skeleton of epothilones and that of several of their analogues by a relatively short route. The utilization of intermediate 14, obtained via a stereoselective Wittig reaction and its Enders coupling to SAMP hydrazone 13 (Scheme 8), in combination with a stereoselective aldol reaction with the modified substrate 69 (Scheme 10) improved the stereoselectivity and efficiency of the total synthesis of these new and highly potent microtubule binding antitumor agents.

"The two N donor atoms in the tertiary diamine N,N\xe2\x80\x98-dimethyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (dabn, C9H18N2) are ideally positioned in the bicyclic structure for chelation to a metal center. This feature was utilized to synthesize unusual diamine nickel(0)\xe2\x88\x92ethene and \xe2\x88\x92ethyne complexes, which represent limiting cases of the Pearson hard-soft acid-base concept. Thus, the reaction of Ni(C2H4)3 with dabn affords yellow TP-3 (C9H18N2)Ni(C2H4) (1) (dec. 0 \xc2\xb0C) in which the ethene ligand displays extreme high-field NMR shifts at \xce\xb4(H) 0.27 and \xce\xb4(C) 20.4 and an exceptionally small coupling constant 1J(CH) = 142 Hz. Reaction of 1 with butadiene yields the red mononuclear T-4 complex (C9H18N2)Ni(\xce\xb72-C4H6)2 (2a) in solution, from which the dinuclear derivative {(C9H18N2)Ni(\xce\xb72-C4H6)}2(\xce\xbc-\xce\xb72,\xce\xb72-C4H6) (2) (dec. 20 \xc2\xb0C) is isolated. Complexes 2 and 2a are more soluble than 1 and thus better suited for further reactions. When ethyne is added to a solution of 2 or 2a at \xe2\x88\x9278 \xc2\xb0C, the yellow TP-3 complex (C9H18N2)Ni(C2H2) (3) (dec. \xe2\x88\x9230 \xc2\xb0C) is obtained. The ethyne ligand of 3 exhibits the lowest IR C\xe2\x8b\xaeC stretching frequency (1560 cm-1) and by far the smallest NMR coupling constant 1J(CH) = 178 Hz yet reported for a mononuclear nickel(0)\xe2\x88\x92ethyne complex. In addition, Ni(CO)4 reacts with dabn to yield orange T-4 (C9H18N2)Ni(CO)2 (4). The results demonstrate that tertiary diamines, which are hard Lewis bases and which a priori are expected to coordinate poorly to the soft Lewis acid Ni(0), may be supported in such a coordination by the stabilizing principle of preorganization and consequently act as very powerful donor ligands.

"The mechanism of photoinduced electron transfer between sulfur-containing alcohols and the 4-carboxybenzophenone (CB) triplet state in aqueous solution was investigated using laser flash photolysis and steady-state photolysis techniques. Bimolecular rate constants for quenching of the CB triplet state by five hydroxyalkyl sulfides, 2-(methylthio)ethanol (2-MTE), 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-dihydroxydiethyl sulfide (2,2\xe2\x80\x98-DHE), 3-(methylthio)propanol (3-MTP), 3,3\xe2\x80\x98-dihydroxydipropyl sulfide (3,3\xe2\x80\x98-DHP), and 4-(methylthio)butanol (4-MTB), with varying numbers of OH groups and varying locations with respect to the sulfur atom, were determined to be in the range (3.3\xe2\x88\x924.8) \xc3\x97 109 M-1 s-1 for neutral solutions. The intermediates identified were the CB ketyl radical anion (CB\xe2\x80\xa2-), the CB ketyl radical (CBH\xe2\x80\xa2), and intermolecularly (S\xe2\x88\xb4S)-bonded radical cations. An additional absorption band at approximately 400 nm in the transient spectra for some of the hydroxyalkyl sulfides was assigned to the intramolecularly (\xe2\x80\xa2S\xe2\x88\x92O)-bonded species (only for hydroxyalkyl sulfides which could adopt a five-membered ring structure). The spectra of appropriate (S\xe2\x88\xb4S)+ and (\xe2\x80\xa2S\xe2\x88\x92O) intermediates for the hydroxyalkyl sulfides were determined from complementary pulse radiolysis studies in acid and neutral aqueous solutions of the hydroxyalkyl sulfides, respectively. The observation of ketyl radical anions and intermolecular (S\xe2\x88\xb4S)-bonded radical cations of the hydroxyalkyl sulfides was direct evidence for the participation of electron transfer in the mechanism of quenching. Quantum yields of formation of intermediates from flash photolysis experiments and quantum yields of formaldehyde formation from the steady-state measurements were determined. The values of these quantum yields indicated that the diffusion apart (escape of the radical ions) of the charge-transfer complex, formed as a primary photochemical step, is a minor photochemical pathway (with a contribution of \xe2\x88\xbc5\xe2\x88\x9225% depending on the numbers of OH groups). Competing processes of proton transfer and back electron transfer within the CT complex gave significant contributions to these yields. Detailed mechanisms for the CB-sensitized photooxidation of sulfur-containing alcohols are proposed, discussed, and compared with that for the \xe2\x80\xa2OH-induced oxidation. One striking feature of the mechanisms is that there is a catalytic influence of neighboring groups on the radical reaction pathways during one-electron oxidation of the hydroxyalkyl sulfides in comparison to comparable reactions of nonsubstituted alkyl sulfides. Support for the mechanisms came in part from an analysis of observed solvent isotope effects on radical quantum yields. "
"CASSCF and CASPT2N/6-31G* calculations on silacyclopropane (1) find that the transition state for hydrogen migration in concert with ring opening, leading to ethylsilylene (2), has an energy that is significantly lower than the energies of the 1-sila- and 2-silatrimethylene diradicals (6 and 7), formed by ring opening alone. (12/12)CASPT2N calculations, corrected for differences in zero-point energies, give barriers of 24.7 and 13.2 kcal/mol, respectively, for the silacyclopropane to ethylsilylene reaction and its reverse. These values are in reasonable agreement with experimental estimates of 23\xe2\x88\x9228 and 10.4 kcal/mol, respectively, for the corresponding reactions of alkylsilacyclopropanes. Diradicals 6 and 7, which are transition states, are computed to be ca. 20 kcal/mol higher in energy than the transition state leading to ethylsilylene (2). The barrier to the conversion of 2 to 1-silapropene (3) is calculated to be 30.7 kcal/mol. The strong preference for opening of silacyclopropane (1) to ethylsilylene (2), which contrasts with the opening of cyclopropane to the trimethylene diradical, is interpreted in terms of the relative Si\xe2\x88\x92H and C\xe2\x88\x92H BDE\'s in primary silyl and alkyl radicals.

"Cryptophanes are aromatic hosts which bind a variety of guests. Here, we describe a 25 ns molecular dynamics simulation of a particular cryptophane host\xe2\x88\x92guest complex in water. The cryptophane used in this study was used previously in a 20 ns molecular dynamics simulation to describe the fluctuations of the uncomplexed host. This cryptophane features three pores which open onto a cavity where the guests bind. In the current study, tetramethylammonium ion (TMA+) has been placed within the cryptophane cavity to form the host\xe2\x88\x92guest complex. The molecular dynamics simulation in combination with a surfacing algorithm provides information on the frequency with which the cryptophane pores open wide enough to admit or release guest molecules of any given size. We discuss these fluctuations and their possible consequences for binding kinetics, making comparisons between the cryptophane and the cryptophane\xe2\x88\x92TMA+ complex. "
"The hydronium ion catalyzed vinyl alcohol\xe2\x88\x92acetaldehyde isomerization was investigated via ab initio molecular orbital (MO) calculations with/without a dielectric continuum (DC) method and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with the statistical perturbation theory. The cluster models, composed of CH2CHOH, H3O+, and H2O molecules, were considered, and the potential energy profiles of double proton transfers both in the gas phase and in the aqueous solution were obtained by ab initio MO calculations. In order to clarify the mechanism suitable for the reaction, two possible mechanisms, concerted and stepwise, have been proposed. Our results indicated that the double-proton transfers prefer to occur separately not only in the gas phase but also in the aqueous solution, to support the preference for the stepwise mechanism. The solvent effect difference between the DC method and MC simulations was also examined along the stepwise reaction path by plotting the free energy profiles. It was found that MC simulations improve considerably the energy barrier of activation by the DC method (5.0 kcal/mol) to present 13.5 kcal/mol for the free energy barrier of activation. The present value shows good accordance with the experimental value, i.e., 15.2 kcal/mol. "
"Density functional calculations (Becke3LYP/6-31G(d)) on the (3 + 2) transition structures of osmium tetroxide mediated dihydroxylations of chiral allylic ethers show that the stereoselectivity is controlled by the \xe2\x80\x9cinside alkoxy effect\xe2\x80\x9d (Stork/Houk-J\xc3\xa4ger model). In the special case of Z-disubstituted alkenes, 1,3-allylic strain (Kishi model) controls the stereoselectivity. "
A series of oxonium and carboxonium ions and their corresponding protonated dications were investigated by ab initio/IGLO/GIAO-MP2 methods. The calculated 17O and 13C NMR chemical shifts were compared with the solution phase experimental data for the monocations. The structures and energies of a number of oxonium and carboxonium dications and the effect of diprotonation on the 17O and 13C NMR chemical shifts were also studied. 
"The addition of ethene to Mo(NH)(CHR)(OR\xe2\x80\x98)2 (R = H, Me; R\xe2\x80\x98 = CH3, CF3) has been studied with both ab initio molecular orbital and density functional theory calculations. Geometry optimizations were carried out with the HF/3-21G, HF/HW3, and B3LYP/HW3 methods. The energies were further evaluated with the MP2/HW3 and B3LYP/HWF (HWF basis set is equivalent to the 6-311G** basis set) methods. Ethene significantly favors attacking on the CNO face. The attack on the COO face by ethene is disfavored by 12.3 and 18.8 kcal/mol for R\xe2\x80\x98 = CH3 and CF3, respectively. The transition structure for the CNO face addition is in a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry, with the NH and one of the OR\xe2\x80\x98 groups axial. The calculated activation energy is low for R\xe2\x80\x98 = CH3, and it is significantly lower for R\xe2\x80\x98 = CF3. In agreement with the experiment, the syn alkylidene is calculated to be more stable than the anti rotamer (R = CH3). This is apparently due to the stabilizing agostic interaction involving the anti-H of the syn rotamer on the COO face. However, the transition structures derived from the syn and anti rotamers have similar stabilities, due to the disappearance of the agostic interaction. Thus, the anti alkylidene is effectively a more reactive catalyst than the syn alkylidene. The molybdacyclobutane product significantly favors a square pyramidal geometry when R\xe2\x80\x98 = CH3, but has a slight preference for a trigonal bipyramidal geometry when R\xe2\x80\x98 = CF3. "
"A dynamic NMR study of a number of acyclic N,N-dialkylneopentylamines, supported by molecular mechanics calculations, is reported. With simple alkyl groups, eclipsed conformations are encountered for the NCH2\xe2\x88\x92But bond, which has a high 1-fold rotational barrier. The N-inversion/rotation process for Me2NCH2But was rendered detectable by desymmetrizing the molecule as Me2NCHDBut. Here the decoalescence of separate 13C signals for the diastereotopic NMe groups allowed the measurement of the corresponding free energy of activation (\xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 9.4 kcal mol-1). With significantly more branched alkyl groups, the N\xe2\x88\x92CH2But bond adopts a conformation intermediate between staggered and eclipsed. Trineopentylamine and an analogue undergo a novel concerted back and forward 60\xc2\xb0 rotation through eclipsed conformations about the N\xe2\x88\x92CH2But bonds, with a barrier which dynamic NMR indicates must be at least 8.3 kcal mol-1.

"The exchange interaction between two triplet carbene centers through diphenyl sulfide 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-diyl, its sulfoxide and sulfone analogs, and thiaxanthene 2,7-diyl coupling units was studied. These dicarbenes were generated by photolysis of the corresponding bisdiazo precursors in MTHF matrices at cryogenic temperatures. From the temperature dependence of the ESR signals it was found that the dicarbene jointed through the sulfide group has a quintet ground state; it serves as a ferromagnetic coupler. On the other hand, as the oxidation state or the geometry of the sulfur atom was changed to sulfoxide, sulfone, and thiaxanthene groups, antiferromagnetic interaction was observed between the two diphenylcarbene units. The magnitude of the exchange interaction J/k was determined to be 11, \xe2\x88\x9230, \xe2\x88\x9292, and \xe2\x88\x9221 K for diphenyl sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-diyl, and thiaxanthene 2,7-diyl couplers, respectively. In the ESR spectra of sterically unconstrained sulfide and its analogs the isolated triplet signals were rather strong. In the thiaxanthene analog, however, this ratio of the isolated triplet signals to those of the other spin multiplicities was smaller. The isolated triplets were attributed to the conformation where the two phenyl rings were perpendicular to each other. It was demonstrated that the magnetic interaction could be tailored from ferro- to antiferromagnetic coupling by changing the oxidation state or geometry of the sulfur atom. "
"A density functional method has been used to successfully predict the isotropic 59Co nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts of the following anionic, cationic and neutral Co(III) complexes:\xe2\x80\x89 [Co(CN)6]3-, [Co(NH3)6]3+, [Co(NO2)6]3-, [Co(NH3)4CO3]+, Co(acac)3, and [Co(en)3]3+. Isotropic chemical shifts are well-reproduced by using Wachters\' cobalt basis set and uniform 6-31G* basis sets on the light atoms, together with the use of the B3LYP hybrid functional. In addition, the principal elements of the 59Co shielding tensor (\xcf\x8311, \xcf\x8322, and \xcf\x8333), the absolute shieldings of Co(CN)63- and Co(acac)3, and the Co\xe2\x88\x92C bond length shielding derivative for Co(CN)63- are also in good agreement with previous experimental estimates. There are no obvious distinctions between the predicted shifts (or shielding tensor elements) of anionic and cationic complexes. The ability to successfully predict both shift trends, absolute shieldings, shielding tensor elements, and a vibrational shielding derivative for d6 transition metal complexes opens up new possibilities for probing metal ions in biological systems by using NMR spectroscopy.

"Three-dimensional, triple resonance NMR techniques are described for measurement of two-bond (intraresidual) and three-bond (sequential) amide deuterium isotope effects on 13C\xce\xb1 chemical shifts. Measurements were carried out for uniformly 15N and 13C labeled human ubiquitin equilibrated in a 50% H2O/50% D2O mixed solvent. The three-bond isotope shift, 3\xce\x94C\xce\xb1(ND), ranges from about 10\xe2\x88\x9250 ppb, and, except for residues with positive \xcf\x86 angles and residues followed by Gly, its magnitude is described by 3\xce\x94C\xce\xb1(ND) = 30.1 + 22.2 sin(\xcf\x88) \xc2\xb1 3.4 ppb. The two-bond isotope shift, 2\xce\x94C\xce\xb1(ND), ranges from 70 to 116 ppb and is also dominated by the local backbone geometry at the C\xce\xb1 position:\xe2\x80\x89 2\xce\x94C\xce\xb1(ND) = 93.1 + 10.1 sin(\xcf\x86+62\xc2\xb0) + 12.0 sin(\xcf\x88+42\xc2\xb0) \xc2\xb1 4.1 ppb.

"Cross-correlation between 15N\xe2\x88\x921H dipolar interactions and 1HN chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) gives rise to different relaxation rates of the doublet components of 1H\xe2\x88\x92{15N} peptide backbone amides. Two schemes for quantitative measurement of this effect are described and demonstrated for samples of uniformly 15N-enriched ubiquitin and perdeuterated 15N-enriched HIV-1 protease. The degree of relaxation interference correlates with the isotropic 1HN chemical shift, and results indicate that an upfield change of the most shielded principal components of the CSA tensor is correlated with an approximately 2-fold larger downfield shift of the average of the other two components. The magnitude of the relaxation interference is large in \xce\xb2-sheet and considerably smaller in \xce\xb1-helices. This correlation is not dominated by the backbone geometry but reflects the slightly longer hydrogen bond length in helices compared to \xce\xb2-sheet. The smallest relaxation interference effect in ubiquitin is observed for Ser20-HN and Ile36-HN, which are the only two amide protons that are not hydrogen bonded in the crystal structure of ubiquitin, inaccessible to solvent, and not highly mobile.

"High-level ab initio molecular orbital calculations have been carried out for the phenyl cation (1), the phenyl radical (2), and the phenyl anion (3). Our best estimate for the heat of formation (\xce\x94Hf\xe2\x80\x89298) of the phenyl radical is 340 kJ mol-1, corresponding to 476 kJ mol-1 for the 298 K C\xe2\x88\x92H bond dissociation energy in benzene. The calculated \xce\x94Hf\xe2\x80\x89298 of the phenyl anion is 224 kJ mol-1, leading to an electron affinity for the phenyl radical of 116 kJ mol-1, and a gas-phase acidity for benzene of 1671 kJ mol-1. The ground state of the phenyl cation is found to be a singlet (1-1A1, \xce\x94Hf\xe2\x80\x89298 = 1134 kJ mol-1), with the triplet (1-3B1, \xce\x94Hf\xe2\x80\x89298 = 1237 kJ mol-1) lying significantly higher in energy (by 103 kJ mol-1). The energies of the 1-1A1 and 1-3B1 states of the phenyl cation at the phenyl radical geometry are much closer, but 1-1A1 remains the energetically lowest electronic state. The essentially isoenergetic 1-3A2 and 1-1A2 states lie about 25 kJ mol-1 higher in energy than 1-3B1, while 1-1B1 is nearly 60 kJ mol-1 higher in energy. The implications of these results with respect to recent spectroscopic studies of the phenyl radical and the role of the triplet phenyl cation in the dissociation of benzene cation are discussed. "
"Time distributions of neutral molecules desorbed from a chemisorbed self-assembled monolayer of phenylethanethiol on gold have been measured subsequent to 8 keV Ar+ and H2+ ion bombardment. These distributions show that, regardless of the projectile used, most of the ejected molecules leave the surface with thermal kinetic energies (\xe2\x88\xbc0.03 eV). The shapes of the distributions have a strong surface temperature dependence over the range 240\xe2\x88\x92300 K. This behavior is well described by a convolution of the Maxwell\xe2\x88\x92Boltzmann distribution and the rate equation for first-order desorption. The results imply that kiloelectronvolt ion bombardment initiates a process which breaks the adsorbate\xe2\x88\x92surface bond, leaving the resulting physisorbed molecules to evaporate after attaining thermal equilibrium with the substrate. A mechanism for this gentle cleavage of the adsorbate\xe2\x88\x92substrate bond is proposed. "
"The reaction mechanism of the nonenzymatic transmethylation of catechol by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet, as modeled by sulfonium ion) has been elucidated using ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanical methods. The gas phase reaction between catecholate and sulfonium is extremely fast, involving no overall barrier. The reaction profile to some extent resembles a typical gas phase SN2 reaction. However, in aqueous solution, this reaction is very slow with a predicted barrier of 37.3 kcal/mol. The calculated (kH/kD)\xce\xb1, k12/k13, k16/k18, and k32/k34 are 0.80, 1.06, 1.003, and 1.010, respectively. Previously, Schowen and co-workers measured (kH/kD)\xce\xb1 and k12/k13 to be 0.83 \xc2\xb1 0.05 and 1.09 \xc2\xb1 0.05 for the catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation of 3,4-dihydroxyacetophenone by AdoMet. This good agreement between the calculated kinetic isotope effects for the model reaction and the measured kinetic isotope effects for the enzymatic reaction seems to suggest that the structure of the enzymatic transition state is very similar to that of the nonenzymatic reaction. Factors that modulate the catalytic efficacy of catechol O-methyltransferase were discussed in light of the present study on the nonenzymatic reaction and the recently solved X-ray crystal structure.

"Cyclic imine sugars were prepared by a novel chemoenzymatic strategy in which azido-sugars, constructed by enzymatic aldol reactions, were hydrogenated under acidic conditions. These cyclic imine sugars were found to be potent inhibitors of glycoprocessing enzymes having Ki\'s in the nanomolar and micromolar range for a variety of glycosidases. In comparison with their fully hydrogenated counterparts the cyclic imine sugars generally showed comparable or better inhibition against the glycosidases tested. Because these cyclic imines are so readily available and since imines are key intermediates in a variety of cycloadditions, condensations, and nucleophilic additions, they are valuable as versatile synthetic intermediates for the preparation of novel iminocyclitols and derivatives. An example of such synthetic utility is demonstrated by the synthesis of amino-iminocyclitol 24 via a three-center, two-component Strecker reaction. A novel method for rapidly screening glycosidase inhibitors using electrospray mass spectrometry is also described and shown to be capable of identifying potent fucosidase inhibitors for detailed kinetic analysis. Also, in the reductive amination of azido-sugars for the preparation of the five-membered ring iminocyclitol 8, rhodium was found to exhibit superior face selectivity when compared to palladium or platinum catalysts.

"Several sialyl Lewis X (SLex) mimics that contain the essential functional groups for receptor interaction and a negative charge or a hydrophobic group have been developed as inhibitors of E-, P-, and L-selectins. Some of the mimics exhibit selectin inhibition activities 103\xe2\x88\x92104-fold more potent than does the natural ligand tetrasaccharide, with IC50 in the low micromolar to high nanomolar range. The syntheses of these mimics are relatively simple, using TMSOTf-Ac2O mediated C-glycosylation with concurrent selective deprotection of the primary benzyl group and enzymatic aldol addition reactions as key steps.

"Brownian dynamics simulations of the encounter kinetics between the active site of the wild-type and Glu199 mutant of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase (TcAChE) with a charged substrate were performed. In addition, ab initio quantum chemical calculations using the 3-21G basis set were undertaken to probe the energetics of the transformation of the Michaelis complex into a covalently bound tetrahedral intermediate using various models of the wild-type and Glu199Gln mutant active sites. The quantum calculations predicted about a factor of 32 reduction in the rate of formation of the tetrahedral intermediate upon the Glu199Gln mutation and showed that the Glu199 residue located in the proximity of the enzyme active triad boosts AChE\'s activity in a dual fashion:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) by increasing the encounter rate due to the favorable modification of the electric field inside the enzyme reaction gorge and (2) by stabilization of the transition state for the first chemical step of catalysis. Our calculations also demonstrate the critical role of the oxyanion hole in stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate and suggests that a charge relay mechanism may operate in the Glu199Gln mutant AChE as opposed to a general base mechanism as in the wild-type enzyme.

"Analogues of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) containing modified amino acids at single, predetermined sites have been prepared. This was accomplished by the use of the DHFR gene containing an engineered nonsense codon (TAG) at the positions corresponding to Val-10 and Asp-27. Misacylated suppressor tRNAs activated with the modified amino acids of interest were employed for the suppression of the nonsense codons in a cell free protein biosynthesizing system, thereby permitting the elaboration of the desired protein analogues. In this fashion, the aspartic acid analogues erythro-carboxyproline, cysteic acid, \xce\xb2,\xce\xb2-dimethylaspartic acid, \xce\xb1-methylaspartic acid, erythro- and threo-\xce\xb2-methylaspartic acid, N-methylaspartic acid, and phosphonoalanine were incorporated into one or both of the aformentioned positions. Although a number of these analogues were incorporated only in low yield, a modification of the strategy has suggested how this might be improved significantly. The derived proteins were purified and then characterized by their mobility on polyacrylamide gels in comparison with wild-type DHFR. Representative DHFRs modified at position 10 were also degraded by defined proteolysis with Glu-C endoproteinase; the fragments containing the modified amino acids were shown to have the same chromatographic properties on reverse phase HPLC as authentic synthetic standards. Individual analogues were assayed for their abilities to bind to the substrate analogue methotrexate and to convert dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. DHFR analogues containing erythro- and threo-\xce\xb2-methylaspartic acid and \xce\xb2,\xce\xb2-dimethylaspartic acid were all shown to mediate tetrahydrofolate production 74\xe2\x88\x9286% as efficiently as wild-type DHFR under conditions of multiple substrate turnover. Analysis of the rates of tetrahydrofolate production in the presence of NADPH and NADPD at two pH values suggests that this was due to rate-limiting hydride transfer from NADPH bound to DHFR analogues whose active site had been altered structurally.

"A series of phosphonochloridates was prepared from the corresponding phosphonate monoesters, and their reactions with alcohols, amines, and the bisnucleophile 4-aminobutan-1-ol have been investigated using 31P NMR spectroscopy. In the conversion of phosphonate monoesters to phosphonochloridates via the addition of thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride, pyrophosphonate anhydrides were found to be formed readily as byproducts. The anhydrides reacted readily with alcohols, but more slowly than the corresponding phosphonochloridates, and only sluggishly, if at all, with amines. Therefore, when phosphonamides are prepared, anhydride formation must be suppressed. This is accomplished when the monoester is added to the chloridating agent. Unhindered phosphonochloridates reacted predominantly with the amino function of 4-aminobutan-1-ol to furnish the phosphonamidates, whereas a sterically hindered phosphonochloridate demonstrated a preference for O-coupling. This result indictes that the energy gained during P\xe2\x88\x92O bond formation surmounts the kinetic barrier resulting from steric hindrance more effectively than formation of the weaker P\xe2\x88\x92N bond. Importantly, treatment of the phosphonochloridates with tertiary amines prior to addition of the nucleophile resulted in the formation of hitherto unrecognized phosphonylating agents, which we formulated as phosphonyltrialkylammonium salts. The latter, unlike the anhydrides, are more reactive than the phosphonochloridates toward both alcohols and amines, affording improved yields of phosphonate esters and amides. These improved yields are not obtained when triethylamine is added simultaneously with the nucleophile merely to neutralize acid rather than as a deliberate step to generate the phosphonyltrialkylammonium salts. Use of these novel phosphonylating agents proceeded without concomitant racemization at stereogenic centers \xce\xb1 to phosphorous. Interestingly, reaction of even an unhindered phosphonyltriethylammonium salt with 4-aminobutan-1-ol favored O-phosphonylation over N-phosphonylation by a factor of 8, demonstrating that both the charge transfer in the transition state and steric hindrance affect the propensity for P\xe2\x88\x92O vis a vis P\xe2\x88\x92N bond formation. In marked contrast, simultaneous addition of this bisnucleophile and triethylamine, like coupling in the absence of tertiary amine, afforded the phosphonate and phosphonamide in nearly equal amounts.

"Several cis-fused decalin pyranosides with intramolecular nucleophiles of high effective molarity were studied to determine the ratio between endocyclic and exocyclic cleavage in specific-acid-catalyzed solvolysis reactions. The molecular design that allows a differentiation between endo- or exocyclic cleavage is the symmetry and asymmetry of the respective oxocarbenium ion intermediates. The synthesis of the molecular probes involves eight steps from a known compound, and proceeds via a key intermediate functionalized with three different oxidation states. A crystal structure confirmed the relative stereochemistry of the probes. A quantifiable percentage of endocyclic cleavage for \xce\xb2-pyranosides was found for all reaction conditions, whereas \xce\xb1-pyranosides show exclusively exocyclic cleavage. The percent of endocyclic cleavage for \xce\xb2-pyranosides is dependent upon the temperature, the aglycon group, and the solvent. At lower temperatures endocyclic cleavage increases. The \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 for endocyclic and exocyclic cleavage were determined to be 19.2 \xc2\xb1 1.4 kcal/mol and \xe2\x88\x9212.6 \xc2\xb1 6.1 eu, and 22.8 \xc2\xb1 1.1 kcal/mol and 3.7 \xc2\xb1 3.8 eu in methanol, respectively. These values support the theory of stereoelectronic control in the cleavage of pyranoside acetals. Pyranosides with phenyl aglycon groups exhibit significantly lower percentages of endocyclic cleavage than pyranosides with alkyl aglycon groups. Although an exact percentage of endocyclic cleavage of pyranosides in water could not be determined, it appears to be approximately the same or greater than that which occurs in methanol. The addition of non-hydrogen-bonding/non-nucleophilic solvents increased the percent of endocyclic cleavage. The results are interpreted to support some extent of nucleophilic assistance in the endocyclic solvolysis of pyranosides, stereoelectronic control on the site of cleavage, and the possibility of endocyclic cleavage at the active site of glycosyl transfer enzymes.

"Radical cations generated from 1-cyclopropylnaphthalene (1), 1-bromo-4-cyclopropylnaphthalene (2), and 2-cyclopropylnaphthalene (3) were studied electrochemically. Oxidation of all these substrates in CH3CN in the presence of CH3OH leads to cyclopropane ring-opened products, i.e., the corresponding (1,3-dimethoxypropyl)naphthalenes. However, the rate constant for methanol-induced ring opening (Ar-c-C3H5\xe2\x80\xa2+ + CH3OH \xe2\x86\x92 ArCH(\xe2\x80\xa2)CH2CH2O(H+)CH3) is extremely small (<20 M-1 s-1 for the \xce\xb1-cyclopropylnaphthalenes) despite the fact that ring opening is exothermic by nearly 30 kcal/mol. These results are explained on the basis of a product-like transition state for ring opening wherein the positive charge is localized on the cyclopropyl group, and thus unable to benefit from potential stabilization offered by the aromatic ring. "
"Highly enantioenriched substitution products can be obtained by the (\xe2\x88\x92)-sparteine mediated lithiation\xe2\x88\x92substitution reactions of the laterally lithiated intermediates 3\xc2\xb71 and 14\xc2\xb71 derived from the amides 2 and 13. Either enantiomer of the products can be obtained with high enantioenrichment using (\xe2\x88\x92)-sparteine as the ligand by appropriate choice of the protocol. The enantiodetermining step in both sequences occurs after deprotonation. Enantioenrichment in the sequence with 3\xc2\xb71 arises from a dynamic kinetic resolution, whereas enantioenrichment in the sequence with 14\xc2\xb71 arises from a dynamic thermodynamic resolution.

"A series of CuII and ZnII complexes with new ligands having either one or two substituted phenolates appended to the 1,4,7-triazacyclononane frame were prepared and characterized by optical absorption, EPR, NMR, and/or resonance Raman spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and, in eight cases, X-ray crystallography. Features of the active site geometries of the CuII\xe2\x88\x92tyrosinate forms of galactose and glyoxal oxidases (GAO and GLO) were modeled by these complexes, including the binding of a redox-active phenolate and an exogenous ligand (Cl-, CH3CO2-, or CH3CN) in a cis-equatorial position of a square pyramidal metal ion. The role of the unique ortho S\xe2\x88\x92C covalent bond between a cysteine (C228) and the equatorial tyrosinate (Y272) in the proteins was probed through an examination of the optical absorption and electrochemical properties of sets of similar complexes comprised of phenolate ligands with differing ortho substituents, including thioether groups. The o-alkylthio unit influences the PhO- \xe2\x86\x92 CuII LMCT transition and the MII\xe2\x88\x92phenolate/MII\xe2\x88\x92phenoxyl radical redox potential, but to a relatively small degree. Electrochemical and chemical one-electron oxidations of the CuII and ZnII complexes of ligands having tert-butyl protecting groups on the phenolates yielded new species that were identified as novel MII\xe2\x88\x92phenoxyl radical compounds analogous to the active CuII\xe2\x88\x92tyrosyl radical forms of GAO and GLO. The MII\xe2\x88\x92phenoxyl radical species were characterized by optical absorption, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopy, as well as by their stoichiometry of formation and chemical reduction. Notable features of the CuII\xe2\x88\x92phenoxyl radical compounds that are similar to their protein counterparts include EPR silence indicative of magnetic coupling between the CuII ion and the bound radical, a band with \xce\xbbmax \xe2\x89\x88 410 nm (\xce\xb5 \xe2\x89\x88 3900 M-1 cm-1) in UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectra diagnostic for the phenoxyl radical, and a feature attributable to the phenoxyl radical C\xe2\x88\x92O vibration (\xce\xbd7a) in resonance Raman spectra. Similar Raman spectra and electrochemical behavior for the ZnII analogs, as well as an isotropic signal at g = 2.00 in their X-band EPR spectra, further corroborate the formulations of the MII\xe2\x88\x92phenoxyl radical species.

"Two spherical tensor harmonic models for the spectral intensities of infrared and Raman bands of large, and particularly spherical, molecules are presented and applied to the terminal \xce\xbd(CO) modes of homonuclear metal carbonyl clusters. The first is applicable when it appears that the coupling between CO groups on different metals effectively competes with that on one metal. It predicts that the closer the arrangement of carbonyl groups approaches spherical, the closer will the spectral pattern be to a single infrared band and two Raman bands, one on either side of the infrared band. When it appears that coupling between CO groups on one metal dominates that between CO groups on different metals, a different intensity pattern is expected, although simplifications compared to the results of a point-group analysis are again predicted.

"A series of monomeric palladium amido complexes of the form trans-(PPh3)2Pd(Ar)(NAr\xe2\x80\x982) and (DPPF)Pd(Ar)(NAr\xe2\x80\x982) (DPPF = 1,1\xe2\x80\x98-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) and dimeric palladium amido complexes of the form {(PPh3)Pd(Ar)(\xce\xbc-NHR)}2 (R = Ph, t-Bu) have been prepared by the reaction of lithium and potassium amides with palladium aryl halide complexes. An X-ray crystal structure of (DPPF)Pd(p-NMe2C6H4)[N(p-CH3C6H4)2] was obtained. Upon thermolysis in the presence of PPh3, serving as a trapping agent, both the monomeric and dimeric palladium amido complexes underwent C\xe2\x88\x92N-bond-forming reductive elimination to form arylamines in high yields along with a Pd(0) species. Reductive elimination was also observed from azametallacycle (PPh3)Pd(\xce\xb72-C6H4C6H4NH), to form carbazole and Pd(PPh3)4 at room temperature. Mechanistic studies on the reductive elimination reactions of the monomeric PPh3-ligated amido complexes indicated the presence of two competing pathways for the formation of amine. At low [PPh3], reductive elimination occurs via phosphine dissociation to form a three-coordinate intermediate; however, as [PPh3] is increased, a pathway of reductive elimination from a four-coordinate complex becomes dominant. The DPPF-ligated palladium amido complexes directly eliminated amine from the four-coordinate complex. The mechanism of the reductive elimination from dimeric palladium amido complexes was also studied. These complexes undergo reductive elimination of amine via dimer dissociation to generate a three-coordinate intermediate analogous to those formed by the PPh3-ligated monomeric amido complexes. The C\xe2\x88\x92N-bond forming reductive elimination reactions were accelerated by electron-withdrawing groups on the Pd bound aryl group and by electron-donating groups on the amido ligand, suggesting that the aryl group acts as an electrophile and the amido ligand acts as a nucleophile.

"Bis(hexafluoroacetylacetonato)copper(II) {Cu(hfac)2} formed with diazodi-4-pyridylmethane yellow-green plates (a) and dark green bricks (b) in a 1:1 complex. X-ray crystal and molecular structure analysis of a single crystal of a revealed that the two pyridyl nitrogens of two different ligand molecules are coordinated with Cu(II) in a trans configuration to produce a one-dimensional chain. Complex b contains solvent molecules. The temperature dependence of molar magnetic susceptibility revealed that, while the complexes are dilute Cu(II) paramagnets before irradiation, they become ferromagnetic chains due to 3d spin of Cu(II) and 2p spins of di-4-pyridylcarbene generated by photolysis of the diazo group. The field dependence of magnetization revealed that the apparent spin quantum number of the ferromagnetic chains amounts to S = ca. 33.6 in complex b. A theoretical approach revealed that the ferromagnetic interaction between the neighboring Cu(II) and the carbene center along the chain amounts to J/kB = +66.8 K. A 1:2 complex of Cu(hfac)2 with diazophenyl-4-pyridylmethane (2) was prepared as a reference, and the photogenerated carbenes in the complex were found to interact with Cu(II) ions in a ferromagnetic fashion.

"The synthesis and photophysical characterization of a series of aryl-substituted 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridyl complexes of RuII are reported. The static and time-resolved emission properties of [Ru(dpb)3](PF6)2, where dpb is 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-diphenyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine, have been examined and are contrasted with those of [Ru(dmb)3](PF6)2 (dmb = 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-dimethyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine). It is shown through analysis of electrochemical data and detailed fitting of the emission spectrum that the unusually large radiative quantum yield for [Ru(dpb)3](PF6)2 in CH3CN solution at room temperature is due to reduction of the degree of geometric distortion along primarily ring-stretch acceptor mode coordinates relative to other molecules in this class. It is proposed that the 3MLCT excited state of [Ru(dpb)3]2+ is characterized by a ligand conformation in which the 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-phenyl substituents are coplanar with the bipyridyl fragment, leading to extended intraligand electron delocalization and a smaller average change in the C\xe2\x88\x92C bond length upon formation of the excited state as compared to [Ru(dmb)3]2+. These conclusions are further supported by photophysical data on several new molecules, [Ru(dptb)3](PF6)2 (dptb = 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-di-p-tolyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine), [Ru(dotb)3](PF6)2 (dotb = 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-di-o-tolyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine), and [Ru(dmesb)3](PF6)2 (dmesb = 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-dimesityl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine). The systematic increase in steric bulk provided by this ligand series results in clear trends in kr, knr, and SM (the Huang\xe2\x88\x92Rhys factor), consistent with the delocalization model. In addition, time-resolved resonance Raman data reveal frequency shifts in ring-stretch modes across the series supporting the notion that, as the steric bulk of the ligand increases, the ability for the peripheral phenyl rings to become coplanar with the bipyridyl fragment is hindered. Ab initio calculations employing Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock and second-order perturbation theory on neutral and anionic 4-phenylpyridine, put forth as a model for the ground and excited states of [Ru(dpb)3]2+, are also reported. These calculations suggest a canted geometry for the ground state, but a considerable thermodynamic driving force for achieving planarity upon reduction of the ligand. The canted ground-state geometry is also observed in the single-crystal X-ray structure of the mixed-ligand complex [Ru(dmb)2(dpb)](PF6)2. Finally, consideration of how this system evolves from the Franck\xe2\x88\x92Condon state to the planar thermalized 3MLCT state is discussed with regard to the possibility of time-resolving the onset of extended electron delocalization in the excited state by using ultrafast spectroscopy.

"The photodissociation dynamics of H2Fe(CO)4 have been studied through wave packet propagations on CASSCF/CCI potentials, calculated for the electronic ground and excited states, as a function of two coordinates qa and qb corresponding to molecular hydrogen elimination and CO dissociation, respectively. The theoretical absorption spectrum is characterized by two bands at 272 nm (36\xe2\x80\x89700 cm-1) and 246 nm (40\xe2\x80\x89500 cm-1) which have been assigned to the a1A1 \xe2\x86\x92 a1B1 and a1A1 \xe2\x86\x92 b1A1 transitions, respectively. The first band corresponds to the experimental maximum observed around 270 nm. A semiquantitative mechanism has been proposed for the photodissociation of the title molecule:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) under irradiation at 254 nm, the a1B1 (3dyz \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x83g*) and b1A1 (3dx2-y2 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x83g*) excited states will be populated; (ii) from the b1A1 state, the molecule will dissociate in a total and ultrafast (less than 40 fs) reaction toward the formation of Fe(CO)4 and molecular hydrogen; (iii) after the initial a1A1 \xe2\x86\x92 a1B1 transition, the reactive system will evolve into two competitive channels, leading mainly to the elimination of H2 in a very short time scale (40 fs) and as second minor primary reaction (4%) toward the CO dissociation in 100 fs. The nonradiationless transitions to the low-lying triplet states occur in a picosecond time scale and have a rather low probability indicating the minor role of the triplet states at the early stage of the photodissociation.

"In order to clarify systematic trends of governing outer shape of molecules, isopotential energy contours of hydrogen and nitrogen molecules as probed by ground-state atoms from H to Ar have been studied. Periodicity and some interesting patterns have been found for the outer profiles of molecules. When the exchange repulsion energy is dominant, repulsive walls of potential energy curves show a simple exponential decay with hardness depending on the ionization potentials. When anisotropic interactions reduce the exchange repulsion energy effectively, outer shape of molecules probed by atoms are deformed into various forms, even for simple diatomic molecules such as hydrogen and nitrogen.

"Recently, water oxidation in photosystem II was proposed to involve direct abstraction of hydrogen atoms from water molecules terminally ligated to manganese ions in the oxygen-evolving complex by the oxidized tyrosine radical, TyrZ\xe2\x80\xa2. This model is tested here by performing quantum chemical calculations. An empirically parametrized hybrid density functional method is used, and both monomeric and dimeric manganese model systems are studied. It is found that, by coordination to a manganese center, the first O\xe2\x88\x92H bond strength of water is lowered from 113.4 to 84.3 kcal/mol. This O\xe2\x88\x92H bond strength is only 2.8 kcal/mol stronger than that in tyrosine. Using an extended basis set, we find that this difference decreases still further. The second hydrogen abstraction energy is quite similar. Since thermoneutrality in the reaction (or a weak exothermicity) is a requirement for the hydrogen abstraction model, the present calculations support this model. Possible functions of a coordinated chloride and a nearby calcium complex are suggested. Five- or six-coordination and ferro- or antiferromagnetic spin couplings of the manganese centers are discussed. "
"A new pulsed four-wave mixing technique for the detection and real-time measurement of circular dichroism (CD) in liquid samples is demonstrated. The technique is based on the formation and detection of transient thermal gratings formed by the interference of two laser beams whose polarizations are controlled and modulated using a photoelastic modulator. Through an internal heterodyne process, coherent thermal gratings interfere to greatly enhance a weak circular dichroism signal. By measuring the ratio of the difference of scattered laser light from two different polarizations, \xce\x94S, to the average amount of scattered light, Save, one can determine the value of \xce\x94\xce\xb5/\xce\xb5 for the compound under investigation. Samples of chiral camphorquinone are used to demonstrate the technique in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. These studies of camphorquinone, which has a value of \xce\x94\xce\xb5/\xce\xb5 \xe2\x89\x88 10-3 at 266 nm, produce values of \xce\x94S/Save which are orders of magnitude larger than \xce\x94\xce\xb5/\xce\xb5 and which approach 2 (the mathematical limit for \xce\x94S/Save). Possible extensions of the technique for measuring CD in very small sample volumes and monitoring time-dependence are discussed. "
"The A-center of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) resides in the enzyme\'s \xce\xb1-subunit and is responsible for the acetyl-CoA synthase activity. The center comprises a Ni site and an iron\xe2\x88\x92sulfur cluster. We have isolated the \xce\xb1-subunit using both continuous and discontinuous electrophoresis methods. When incubated with CO, samples prepared using continuous gels attain the Ared-CO state that exhibits an S = 1/2 EPR feature (g = 2.048, 2.046, 2.021) similar to the so-called NiFeC signal of native CODH. Both signals consistently quantify to <0.4 spin/\xce\xb1. In order to elucidate the structure of the A-cluster and to understand the cause of the substoichiometric spin intensities, we have studied the \xce\xb1-subunit with M\xc3\xb6ssbauer and EPR spectroscopy. As found for CODH, populations of isolated \xce\xb1 are heterogeneous:\xe2\x80\x89 they contain two major A-cluster forms designated nonlabile and Ni-labile. In native CODH, only the Ni-labile form develops the NiFeC signal and exhibits catalytic activity. Oxidized samples of \xce\xb1 exhibit M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectra (S = 0, \xce\x94EQ = 1.08 mm/s, \xce\xb4 = 0.45 mm/s) typical of [Fe4S4]2+ clusters. Upon reduction with dithionite, the Fe4S4 cluster of nonlabile A-clusters exhibits M\xc3\xb6ssbauer (average \xce\x94EQ = 1.0 mm/s, \xce\xb4 = 0.54 mm/s) and EPR properties similar to those of S = 3/2 [Fe4S4]+ cubanes; in contrast, Ni-labile clusters are not reducible by dithionite. Treatment with CO yielded a sample for which 40% of the Fe was associated with Ared-CO, while 47% of the clusters (the nonlabile form) remained oxidized. Thus, the presence of nonlabile A-clusters is largely responsible for the low spin intensities of the NiFeC signal. Upon formation of Ared-CO, the Fe4S4 portion of the A-cluster exhibits 57Fe magnetic hyperfine interactions; the cluster sites divide into equivalent pairs with (isotropic) AA = AB = \xe2\x88\x9234.2 MHz and AC = AD = +26.8 MHz. However, the values of \xce\x94EQ and \xce\xb4 show that the cluster has remained in the [Fe4S4]2+ state. We explain these observations with an electronic model that considers a Ni+\xe2\x88\x92X\xe2\x88\x92[Fe4S4]2+ assembly for which the Ni+ is exchange-coupled with one Fe site of the cube through a bridging ligand (X). The coupling was found to be substantial, namely |j| \xe2\x89\x88 100 cm-1 (\xe2\x84\x8bNiFe = jSNi\xc2\xb7SFe). The M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectra provide no evidence that CO is bound to the Fe4S4 cluster in the state Ared-CO, as has been concluded from resonance Raman studies [Qiu, D.; Kumar, M.; Ragsdale, S. W.; Spiro, T. G. Science 1994, 264, 817\xe2\x88\x92819]. We could not determine if the two metal centers are linked in the oxidized state (for either the Ni-labile or nonlabile form), but if they are, the Ni2+ must be low-spin (SNi = 0). "
"The conformation of the eight-membered membered 12H-dibenzo[d,g][1,3,2]dioxasilocin ring system was investigated both in the solid-state by X-ray crystallography and in solution by NOE experiments. Ab initio Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock calculations were performed to locate all stationary points for the unsubstituted 12H-dibenzo[d,g][1,3,2]dioxasilocin ring system. The MM2* force field was parametrized to reproduce our ab initio results, and these data were compared to the experimental data. The transition states for conformational interchange were identified. The pseudoequatorial preference for a methyl substituent on either the C(12) carbon atom or silicon is greater than the difference in energy between a boat-chair and twist-boat conformation in 2,4,8,10-tetra-tert-butyl-substituted 12H-dibenzo[d,g][1,3,2]dioxasilocins. The conformations observed in the solid-state X-ray crystal structures of 12H-dibenzo[d,g][1,3,2]dioxasilocins are sensitive to crystal-packing forces and may be different from that in solution. "
"The gas-phase molecular structure and anti\xe2\x88\x92gauche composition of ethane-1,2-diol (ethylene glycol) at 376 and 733 K has been analyzed from electron-diffraction data augmented by rotational constants for eight isotopic species and with the help of results from ab initio calculations. The system model consisted of three conformers, g-Ga, g-Gg, and aAa, which were found to provide a good representation of the 10 possible different conformations. Scaled quantum-mechanical (SQM) force fields in internal coordinates were also evaluated for these three conformers using a set of 13 scale constants determined by a least-squares fitting of the theoretical (HF/6-31G*) force constants to observed wave numbers for the most abundant conformer, g-Ga. The mole fraction of conformers with anti vs gauche OCCO torsion angles (i.e. aAa vs. g-Ga + g-Gg) was found to be 0.08 (2\xcf\x83 = 7) at 376 K and 0.18 (2\xcf\x83 = 11) at 733 K, under conditions in which the mole ratios of g-Ga to g-Gg were maintained at the theoretical predictions of 0.58\xe2\x88\x920.34 (376 K) and 0.40\xe2\x88\x920.42 (733 K). An estimate of the internal energy difference is \xce\x94E\xc2\xb0 = 1.4 (5) kcal/mol for the reaction G \xe2\x86\x92 A and may also be taken as a rough value for the energy of the O\xe2\x88\x92H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O internal hydrogen bond. The value is consistent with estimates made in like fashion for other types of hydrogen bonds in 1,2-disubstituted ethanes. Average values of some of the more important parameters (r\xce\xb10/\xc3\x85; \xe2\x88\xa0\xce\xb1/deg) with estimated 2\xcf\x83 uncertainties at 376 K for the conformers g-Ga, g-Gg, and aAa, respectively, are r(C\xe2\x88\x92C) = {1.517, 1.521, 1.517} (5); r(C\xe2\x88\x92O) = {1.424, 1.424, 1.424} (1); r(O\xe2\x88\x92H) = {0.961, 0.962, 0.960} (8); r(C\xe2\x88\x92H) = {1.118, 1.117, 1.118} (6); \xe2\x88\xa0CCO = 109.3 (4), 111.2 (7), 110.5 (30); \xe2\x88\xa0COH = 105.8 (27), 108.2 (21), 109.6 (21); \xe3\x80\x88\xe2\x88\xa0CCH,OCH\xe3\x80\x89 = 109.1 (10), 108.0 (11), 110.5 (21); \xe2\x88\xa0OCCO = 60.7 (18), 57.5 (30), [180]. Values in curly brackets were refined as groups with differences between members frozen. "
"The toluene radical ion C6H5CH3\xe2\x80\xa2+, generated by resonance two-photon ionization, does not react with a single isobutene molecule (i-C4H8) which has a significantly higher ionization potential (\xce\x94IP = 0.42 eV). However, a reaction is observed involving two i-C4H8 molecules, to form the dimer ion C8H16\xe2\x80\xa2+. A coupled reaction of dimer formation and charge transfer to the dimer is exothermic if the product is an ionized hexene with a low IP. Correspondingly, the observed nominal second-order rate coefficients, (5\xe2\x88\x9225) \xc3\x97 10-12 cm3 s-1, are enhanced by a factor of >105 over the expected value for direct endothermic charge transfer. Pressure and concentration effects suggest a sequential mechanism that proceeds through a C6H5CH3\xe2\x80\xa2+(i-C4H8) reactive \xcf\x80 complex. The complex can isomerize to a nonreactive CH3C6H4-t-C4H9\xe2\x80\xa2+ adduct, or react with a second i-C4H8 molecule to form a C6H5CH3\xe2\x80\xa2+(i-C4H8)2 complex, in which the olefin molecules are activated by the aromatic ion. Similar reactions are observed in the benzene/propene system with a somewhat larger \xce\x94IP of 0.48 eV, suggesting that the charge density on the olefin in the complex is still sufficient to activate it for nucleophilic attack. However, aromatic/olefin systems with \xce\x94IP > 0.87 eV show no olefin dimer formation. At low [i-C4H8] and [Ar] number densities, the rate of formation of C8H16\xe2\x80\xa2+ is proportional to [i-C4H8]2[Ar]. The corresponding fourth-order rate coefficient shows a strong negative temperature coefficient with k = 11 \xc3\x97 10-42 cm9 s-1 at 300 K and 2 \xc3\x97 10-42 cm9 s-1 at 346 K, suggesting that the mechanism can be efficient in low-temperature industrial and interstellar environments. The direct formation of the dimer bypasses the monomer olefin cation and its consequent side-reactions, and directs the products selectively into radical ion polymerization. The products and energy relationships that apply in the gas phase are observed also in clusters. "
"Primary cations of the form XCH2CH2+ (1) are unstable with respect to the bridged isomer cyclo-(CH2)2X+ (2) or the hydride-shift isomer CH3CHX+ (3).Two independent hydrogen isotope experiments for X = OH demonstrate that gaseous HOCH2CH2+ (1a) gives less of its bridged isomer, protonated oxirane (2a), than of its hydride-shift isomer, protonated acetaldehyde (3a).Metastable ion decompositions of ionized HOCH2CH2OPh show that the radical cation decomposes via an ion\xe2\x88\x92neutral complex containing 3a and phenoxy radical. Deuterium labeling studies exhibit no detectable interconversion of the two sp3-carbons, implying that complexes containing 2a are not formed to a measurable extent. An independent neutral product study looks at the radioactive oxirane and acetaldehyde produced when tritium on the methyl group of gaseous CH2TCHTOH undergoes radioactive decay. Loss of a beta-particle and a helium atom forms transient, tritiated 1a. Ions from isomerization of this radiolabeled primary cation were deprotonated by Me3N and gave a >97% yield of acetaldehyde. Quantitative assessment of possible routes to acetaldehyde (including rearrangement of excited 2a) implies that 1 undergoes hydride shift at least 5 times faster than bridging by neighboring oxygen.

"Ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the G-2 and CBS-4 levels of theory were used to determine homolytic bond dissociation energies (BDE\'s) for the B\xe2\x88\x92H bonds in a series of donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor complexes of borane. The B\xe2\x88\x92H bonds of four-coordinate boron were found to be weaker than those of three-coordinate boron. The effect of complexation on BDE varied from very small, in the cases of NH3 and H2O, to as much as 30\xe2\x88\x9250 kcal/mol, in the cases of formaldehyde, CO, and HCN. The BDE\'s were not found to correlate with the strength of coordination. However, they were closely correlated with the degree to which spin density in the radical was delocalized away from boron and onto the associated Lewis base. The presence of either a \xcf\x80 system or, to some extent, a second-row element such as phosphorus or sulfur promoted such delocalization. Delocalization of spin density onto carbon appeared to be particularly favorable, and to correlate with particularly low B\xe2\x88\x92H BDE\'s. The BDE\'s in 4-coordinate complexes of borane with various larger ligands, including typical ethers and amines, followed patterns almost identical with those in the smaller species, and could be understood according to the same principles.

"RNA discrimination by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases involves both major and minor groove interactions with the acceptor stem domain of tRNA substrates. In the case of class II Escherichia coli alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS), minor groove atomic groups in and around the unique G3:U70 base pair previously have been shown to be critical for recognition. In this work, we probe the role of the first (1:72) base pair in discrimination by AlaRS by incorporating 26 new base pair combinations at this site. We find that atomic groups in the wild-type G1:C72 base pair do not contribute as significantly to positive recognition by AlaRS as the minor groove elements in and around the G:U base pair. Our results, however, are consistent with the importance of major groove discrimination at this site. In particular, substrates with a major groove carbonyl oxygen presented by either a G or a U at position 72 are very poor alanine acceptors. Comparison of inactive N1:G72 duplexAla variants with active N1:2-aminopurine72 variants shows that deletion of the 6-keto oxygen and the N1-hydrogen of G72 results in a transition state stabilization of at least 3.0 kcal/mol. This work provides an example of a system that combines minor groove interactions at an internal position with the high selectivity of major groove interactions that are possible at the end of an RNA helix.

"The rotational barriers for cis/trans isomerization of different proline analogues have been investigated by dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopy. To this end the analogues (S)-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (Aze), (S)-piperidine-2-carboxylic acid (Pip), (R)-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (4-Thz), (4R)-2-methylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (2Me4-Thz), (R)-thiazolidine-2-carboxylic acid (2-Thz), (S)-oxazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (4-Oxa), (4S,5R)-5-methyloxazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (5Me4-Oxa), and (2S,4R)-4-hydroxypyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (Hyp) and several N-alkylated amino acids were incorporated into the sequences Ala-Yaa-(4-)nitroanilide and Ala-Gly-Yaa-Phe-(4-)nitroanilide. NMR line-shape analyses of various cis and trans proton signals of these peptides were performed at different temperatures, and the rate constants of cis/trans isomerization were fitted to the Eyring equation. The rotational barriers of all cyclic proline analogues except hydroxyproline were found to be lower than that of proline by about 10 kJ/mol, whereas all noncyclic analogues and hydroxyproline showed rotational barriers similar to that observed for proline. In addition, the ability of cytosolic porcine kidney cyclophilin (Cyp18), a member of the peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase family, to catalyze cis/trans isomerization of the peptide bond preceding the proline analogues was investigated. By line-shape analyses we proved efficient catalysis by Cyp18 for the analogues Aze, 4-Thz, and 2-Thz. "
"Several models have been proposed for the ligand dynamics in the heme a32+/CuB1+ binuclear pocket in cytochrome oxidase following CO photodissociation. These range from straightforward heme pocket relaxation to a variety of ligand exchange processes that have been proposed to be of relevance to the proton pumping function of the enzyme. To provide discrimination between these models, we have used picosecond time-resolved, pump\xe2\x88\x92probe resonance Raman spectroscopy to study the photolysis process in the enzyme isolated from beef heart and from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The intermediate observed within 5 ps of photolysis with low-energy probe pulses (10\xe2\x88\x9220 nJ/pulse) is the high-spin, five-coordinate heme a32+ to which a histidine is ligated, as indicated by the observation of the Fe-His vibration at 220 cm-1. Several control experiments demonstrate that the probe pulse energy is sufficiently low to avoid promoting any significant photochemistry during the spectral acquisition phase of the pump\xe2\x88\x92probe experiment. From these observations, we conclude that histidine is ligated to high-spin heme a32+ on the picosecond time scale following photolysis. Since H376 is the proximal a32+ ligand in the CO complex, our results indicate that this proximal ligation survives photolysis and that the control of the access of exogenous ligands to the heme a3 site by means of a ligand exchange process can be ruled out. We observe similar picosecond transient resonance Raman spectra for the CO complex of Rb. sphaeroides cytochrome c oxidase. From these results and earlier time-resolved Raman and FTIR measurements, we propose a model for the relaxation dynamics of the heme a3 pocket that involves picosecond migration of CO to the CuB center and relaxation of the a32+-proximal histidine bond on the microsecond time scale following CO photolysis.

"Flash photolysis of 10-diazo-9(10H)-phenanthrenone in aqueous solution was found to give two successively formed transient species and to produce fluorene-9-carboxylic acid as the major reaction product. These transients were identified, through solvent isotope effects and the form of acid\xe2\x88\x92base catalysis, as fluorenylideneketene, formed by photo-Wolff reaction of the diazophenanthrenone, and fluorene-9-carboxylic acid enol, formed by hydration of this ketene. Analysis of the rate profile of the enol ketonization reaction produced the first and second ionization constants for the enol ionizing as an oxygen acid, = 2.01 and = 9.61, respectively. The rate of enolization of fluorene-9-carboxylic acid was also determined, by bromine scavenging, and that, coupled with a literature value of the acidity constant of this acid, allowed evaluation of the two keto\xe2\x88\x92enol equilibrium constants (pKE = 9.67 for interconverting un-ionized carboxylic acid and enol and pK\xe2\x80\x98E = 8.24 for interconverting singly ionized acid and enol), and it also allowed evaluation of the two carbon acid acidity constants = 11.67 for ionization of the un-ionized carboxylic acid as a carbon acid and = 17.85 for ionization of its carboxylate ion as a carbon acid). (All acidity constants are concentration quotients applicable at ionic strength 0.10 M.) These keto\xe2\x88\x92enol equilibrium constants and acid dissociation constants are large because of the enol and enolate ion stabilizing effects of the cyclopentadienyl ring of the fluorenyl group; this ring also makes fluorenylideneketene an unusually reactive substance.

"The first generation of [1.1]paracyclophane (1a) and its bis(methoxycarbonyl) derivative (1b) from the corresponding bis(Dewar benzene) precursors, 3a and 3b, has been investigated. Irradiation of 3a in a glassy mixture of ether\xe2\x88\x92isopentane\xe2\x88\x92ethanol at 77 K leads to the formation of species exhibiting absorption extending to 450 nm, which readily undergoes secondary photolysis to give an isomer showing \xce\xbbmax at 244 nm. On the basis of these UV/vis spectral observations and the accompanying 1H NMR measurement, the structures of 1a and the corresponding transannular [4 + 4] adduct (21a) are assigned to the initial and the secondary products, respectively. Compound 3b undergoes similar successive phototransformation into 1b and 21b. [1.1]Paracyclophanes, 1a and 1b, and their photoisomers, 21a and 21b, are sufficiently stable to permit the measurement of 1H NMR spectra at low temperature, but are consumed fairly rapidly in solution at ambient temperature, defying their isolation. The results of geometrical optimization of 1a undertaken at the RHF-SCF, MP2, and B3LYP levels employing the 6-31G* basis set are also presented. Calculations indicate that 1a is a highly strained molecule, but more stable than the related isomers, 3a and 21a:\xe2\x80\x89 the strain energy calculated for 1a is 128.1, 106.5, and 93.6 kcal/mol at the RHF/6-31G*, B3LYP/6-31G*, and MP2/6-31G* levels, respectively. The closest nonbonding interatomic distance between the aromatic rings in 1a is in a range of 2.36\xe2\x88\x922.40 \xc3\x85, and the degree of bending of the benzene rings is comparable to that in [5]paracyclophane, much less as compared to that in [4]paracyclophane. Calculations also support strong transannular electronic interactions between the \xcf\x80-bonds of the aromatic moieties of 1a, which lead to a significantly diminished HOMO-LUMO gap as compared to that in p-xylene. The preparation of 3a and 3b from diethyl 3,6-dihydroterephthalate in 15 and 11 steps, respectively, is described. "
"Three stable alkylidenephosphiranes have been synthesized from the addition of the terminal phosphinidene complex Ph\xe2\x88\x92P\xe2\x88\x92W(CO)5 to allene, 1,1-dimethylallene, and tetramethylallene. Isopropylidenephosphirane 16b was characterized by a single-crystal X-ray structure determination. Demetalation of its W(CO)5 group provides the uncomplexed compound. The addition reaction with tetramethylallene also yields vinylphosphirane epimers, which rearrange to phospholene 20. Ab initio MP2/6-31G* structures and energies are presented for the parent uncomplexed methylenephosphirane and its dimethyl derivatives. "
"An enantioselective synthesis of (+)-epoxydictymene (1) is reported. Condensation of the enantiopure aldehydo ester 5 with (S)-3-isopropylcyclopentenyllithium proceeds selectively to afford 13. Once this lactone was methylenated with the Tebbe reagent, the newly formed allyl vinyl ether was induced into Claisen rearrangement under catalysis with triisobutylaluminum. Sequential hydroboration\xe2\x88\x92oxidation of the resulting dicyclopentacyclooctenone derivative was followed by angular methylation and deoxygenation of the carbonyl functionality. Following epimerization at C-11, an \xce\xb1-hydroxyl was introduced regio- and stereoselectively. Some functional group manipulation led to 57 and 58, both of which underwent efficient cyclization to deliver the complete framework of the target molecule when irradiated with visible light in cyclohexane solution containing iodosobenzene diacetate and iodine. The generality of this key reaction, which efficiently constructs the strained oxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane subunit of 1, is demonstrated. This significant development permitted the conversion of 57 to 1 in two additional steps. "
"The coupling of enantiomerically enriched amines with aryl bromides produces the corresponding N-aryl derivatives. The choice of ligand in the palladium-catalyzed coupling is critical to the formation of the anilines without loss of enantiomeric purity. While LnPd (L = P(o-tolyl)3) successfully catalyzes the intramolecular aryl amination of \xce\xb1-subsituted optically pure amines, intermolecular coupling reactions with this catalyst system gives racemized products. In contrast, intermolecular N-arylations employing LnPd (L = (\xc2\xb1)-BINAP) gives products in good yields with no erosion of enantiopurity. A mechanism for the observed racemization is proposed. The utility of the intramolecular process is demonstrated by the synthesis of 5, an intermediate in the formal synthesis of 6, a potent ACE inhibitor. "
"Photochemical reaction of Ru(PP3)H2 (PP3 = P(CH2CH2PPh2)3) in THF under a rigorously inert atmosphere yields the cyclometalated complex Ru[(Ph2PCH2CH2)2P(CH2CH2PPhC6H4)]H. The latter is converted back to Ru(PP3)H2 under H2 and reacts even with traces of N2 to yield Ru(PP3)(N2). The dinitrogen complex may be synthesized directly by a number of methods. NMR spectroscopy shows that photolysis of Ru(PP3)H2 under C2H4 and CO yields Ru(PP3)(C2H4) and Ru(PP3)(CO), respectively. Photolysis of Ru(PP3)H2 with HSiEt3 in THF yields Ru(PP3)(SiEt3)H, while photolysis in mixtures of THF and benzene at low temperature yields Ru(PP3)(Ph)H. The latter is also generated by reduction of Ru(PP3)Cl2 in the presence of benzene. Os(PP3)(Ph)H is formed either by photolysis of Os(PP3)H2 or by reduction of Os(PP3)Cl2 in the presence of benzene. Irradiation of Os(PP3)H2 in THF or THF/hexane mixtures initially yields the THF C\xe2\x88\x92H activation product, Os(PP3)(2-C4H7O)H. This complex is also generated by reduction of Os(PP3)Cl2 with sodium naphthalenide under N2 in the presence of THF. Os(PP3)(2-C4H7O)H is converted to the cyclometalated complex, Os[(Ph2PCH2CH2)2P(CH2CH2PPhC6H4)]H, on irradiation in THF and to Os(PP3)(Ph)H on irradiation in benzene. Reaction of Os(PP3)H2 with CH3OTf (Tf = triflate) yields Os(PP3)(OTf)H, which is converted to the labile Os(PP3)(CH3)H on reaction with methyllithium. Laser flash photolysis of Ru(PP3)H2 in cyclohexane (laser wavelength 308 nm) yields transient Ru(PP3) with an absorption maximum at 395 nm. The transient reacts with H2, C6H6, HSiEt3, CO, N2, C2H4, and THF with little discrimination; the second-order rate constants for these reactions lie in the range 5 \xc3\x97 105\xe2\x88\x922 \xc3\x97 106 dm3 mol-1 s-1 at 295 K. Kinetic isotope effects have been determined for the reaction with benzene and THF, as 1.5 (0.2) and 1.1 (0.2), respectively. Activation parameters for reaction of Ru(PP3) are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 with HSiEt3 \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 35 (2) kJ mol-1, \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9218 (6) J K-1 mol-1; with C6H6 \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 39 (4) kJ mol-1, \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 \xe2\x89\x88 0 J K-1 mol-1. The reaction with THF yields a short-lived adduct, probably bound through oxygen, which is rapidly converted to the cyclometalated product. Laser flash photolysis of Os(PP3)H2 generates transient Os(PP3) (\xce\xbbmax = 390 nm). The transient kinetics of Os(PP3) are substantially different from its ruthenium analogue. It reacts with alkanes and shows different behavior toward THF but is unaffected by addition of H2. Rate constants in the range 6 \xc3\x97 104\xe2\x88\x926 \xc3\x97 105 dm3 mol-1 s-1 (295 K) are presented for reaction with C6H6, THF, HSiEt3, CO, C2H4, N2, and several alkanes. Kinetic isotope effects have been determined for the reactions with methylcyclohexane and benzene as 5.6 (1.5) and 0.6 (0.1), respectively. The rate constants for reaction with alkanes rise in the order, methylcyclohexane < pentane < heptane < methane. The rate constants for reaction with methane and benzene are insignificantly different. Following reaction of Os(PP3) with THF to form Os(PP3)(THF), C\xe2\x88\x92H insertion occurs with a first-order rate constant of 4.2 (8) \xc3\x97 103 s-1 with kH/kD = 2.6 (0.4). The activation parameters for reaction of Os(PP3) with substrates are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 with pentane \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 27 (1) kJ mol-1, \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9259 (4) J K-1 mol-1; with HSiEt3 \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 31 (5) kJ mol-1, \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9227 (12) J K-1 mol-1; with C6H6 \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 38 (3) kJ mol-1, \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x927 (9) J K-1 mol-1.

"The molecular sieve UTD-1 is investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopies (TEM), solid-state NMR spectroscopy, electron (ED) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), adsorption studies, and catalytic test reactions. The results confirm that UTD-1 is the first high-silica zeolite to contain a one-dimensional, extra-large 14-ring pore system. TEM and ED show that UTD-1 is faulted along the (002) planes. Simulations of XRD patterns of faulted structures using DIFFaX indicate that the XRD pattern of a framework containing the so-called double crankshaft chains is in better agreement with the experimental pattern than a framework with the narsarsukite chains previously reported. Thermal/hydrothermal stability studies show that UTD-1 has similar stability to other medium- and large-pore, high-silica zeolites. The ratio of isomerization to disproportionation, and the distribution of trimethylbenzene isomers in the m-xylene isomerization test reaction from UTD-1 are similar to those obtained from other large-pore zeolites (zeolites Y or L). However, UTD-1 shows a p-/o-xylene ratio of products below one. "
"Reactions of alcohols with WCl2(PMe3)4 (1) or WH2Cl2(PMe3)4 (2) yield W(O)Cl2(PMe3)3 (3), PMe3, and hydrocarbons. Cyclopropanemethanol is deoxygenated to give 1-butene and a trace of trans-2-butene as the organic products; benzyl alcohol yields toluene and bibenzyl. These products indicate the intermediacy of organic radicals. Benzyl radicals in the reaction of 1 with PhCH2OH can be trapped by added 2 or by 9,10-dihydroanthracene (DHA), leading to increased yields of toluene vs bibenzyl. With WD2Cl2(PMe3)4 (2-d2) or DHA-d12, PhCH2D is formed. The reaction of methanol with 1 proceeds similarly in the presence of DHA, forming 3 and methane. Kinetic studies on the reaction of 1 with benzyl alcohol indicate that the reaction proceeds via alkoxide intermediates. A mechanism involving homolysis of the C\xe2\x88\x92O bond in an alkoxide intermediate is suggested by these results. The thermodynamics of this unusual transformation are discussed. "
"Symmetrically substituted octahydroxy porphyrins, tetrakis(3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-dihydroxyphenyl)porphyrin, H2T(3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-DHP)P, tetrakis(2\xe2\x80\x98,6\xe2\x80\x98-dihydroxyphenyl)porphyrin, H2T(2\xe2\x80\x98,6\xe2\x80\x98-DHP)P, and their Zn(II) and Mn(III) derivatives have been developed as building blocks for supramolecular hydrogen-bonded networks. The crystal structures of a series of these porphyrins exhibit unique structural features through assembly of porphyrin networks by means of directional hydrogen bonding. The position of the peripheral hydroxyl groups, the choice of metallo- or free base porphyrin, and the nature of the solvate (i.e., guest) dramatically influence structural features. A one-dimensional, columnar structure is found for H2T(3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-DHP)P\xc2\xb75EtOAc. With benzonitrile as solvate, the structure of H2T(3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-DHP)P\xc2\xb77C6H5CN changes substantially to a three-dimensional corrugated-sheet structure in order to accommodate a larger pore size. When the hydroxyl substituents are simply changed from the m- to the o-phenyl positions, an essentially two-dimensional layered structure is formed for H2T(2\xe2\x80\x98,6\xe2\x80\x98-DHP)P\xc2\xb74EtOAc. Zn[T(2\xe2\x80\x98,6\xe2\x80\x98-DHP)P](EtOAc)2\xc2\xb72EtOAc has a two-dimensional layered structure, similar to that of its free base H2T(2\xe2\x80\x98,6\xe2\x80\x98-DHP)P interaction between the aryl rings of the adjacent layers. The crystal structures of both Zn[T(3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-DHP)P] and Mn[T(3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-DHP)P](Cl) exhibited three-dimensional hydrogen-bonding features. Zn[T(3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-DHP)P](THF)2\xc2\xb72THF\xc2\xb73CH2Cl2 has a three-dimensional interconnected layered structure with metalloporphyrins arranged in a slipped stack orientation within the layers.

In all of these structures, large solvate-filled channels are present with cross-sections as large as 42 \xc3\x852. The pore volumes of these channels are exceptionally large:\xe2\x80\x89 as much as 67% of the unit cell volume. "
"Iridacyclohexadienone complexes, a new class of unsaturated six-membered metallacycles, have been synthesized, and their reactions with acids have been investigated. Treatment  (\xe2\x80\x9ciridabenzene\xe2\x80\x9d 1) with nitrous oxide produces the iridacyclohexadienone  which upon stirring in diethyl ether solution slowly isomerizes to (1,2,5-\xce\xb7-2,4-dimethylpenta-1,3-dien-5-oyl)Ir(PMe3)3 (3). Treatment of 2 with methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate leads to removal of the metal hydride and production  In acetone solution, 4 forms an equilibrium mixture with a ring-contracted iridacyclopentadiene  Treatment of 4 with trimethylphosphine generates the tetrakis(trimethylphosphine)iridacyclohexadienone  Iridacyclohexadienone 2 reacts with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid to produce the iridacyclopentene  In contrast, treatment of iridacyclohexadienones 4 and 6 with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid leads to protonation of oxygen and production of the corresponding \xe2\x80\x9ciridaphenols\xe2\x80\x9d 8 and 10. When 4 is treated with trifluoroacetic acid, an iridaphenol product is again generated (compound 9), but in this case the phenol proton forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the trifluoroacetate ligand. The ring protons in compounds 8, 9, and 10 exhibit downfield 1H NMR chemical shifts consistent with aromatic character. Compounds 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have been structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. "
"Broken-symmetry approximate density functional theory has been used to investigate the electronic and structural properties of the complex Mn2O2(NH3)8z+ in three distinct oxidation states, Mn2IV/IV (z = 4), Mn2III/IV (z = 3) and Mn2III/III (z = 2). In Mn2IV/IV the metal-based electrons are almost completely localized on one center or the other, and occupy the single-ion orbitals derived from the t2g subset of the parent octahedron. The additional two electrons in Mn2III/III enter dz2 orbitals aligned along the Mn\xe2\x88\x92Nax axis, resulting in a significant elongation of these bonds. Both dx2-y2 and dz2 orbitals transform as a1 in C2v symmetry, and so electron density can be transferred from the dz2 orbital on one center to the dx2-y2 orbital on the other. In the symmetric dimers, Mn2IV/IV and Mn2III/III, the energetic separation of the dz2 and dx2-y2 orbitals is sufficiently large to prevent significant delocalization of the metal-based electrons along this pathway. In contrast, a combination of low-spin polarization on MnIV and weak axial ligand field in MnIII combine to bring the two orbitals close together in the mixed-valence dimer, and the unpaired electron is significantly delocalized. The delocalization of the unpaired electron between dz2 and dx2-y2 accounts for the structural trends within the series:\xe2\x80\x89 the loss of electron density from the dz2 orbital at the MnIII site of Mn2III/IV shortens the MnIII\xe2\x88\x92Nax bond relative to that in the symmetric Mn2III/III system. In contrast, the MnIV site in the mixed-valence species is almost identical with that in Mn2IV/IV because the additional electron density enters a Mn\xe2\x88\x92N nonbonding dx2-y2 orbital. The magnetic properties of the dimers are dominated by the symmetric Jxz/xz and Jyz/yz pathways, both of which are ideally oriented for efficient superexchange via the oxo bridges. Redox-induced changes in the Heisenberg exchange coupling constant are caused by changes in geometry of the Mn2O2 core rather than by the generation of new pathways as a consequence of occupation of additional orbitals. The longer Mn\xe2\x88\x92Mn separation and the more acute O\xe2\x88\x92Mn\xe2\x88\x92O angle in Mn2IV/IV improve the efficiency of the Jyz/Jyz pathway, leading to larger coupling constants in the more oxidized species. The delocalization of the unpaired electron in Mn2III/IV along the crossed pathway also provides a possible explanation for the highly anisotropic hyperfine signal observed in the EPR spectrum of the oxygen-evolving complex.

"We develop and test a multistate Gaussian model for the distribution of electrostatic solvation energies of a solute in liquid water. The multistate Gaussian model depends on the discovery of simple indicators of structural substates that individually display Gaussian fluctuations of electrostatic interactions. The probability distribution of electrostatic interactions is then modeled as a superposition of Gaussian distributions of electrostatic interactions of the substates. We find that the number of hydrogen bonds to the solute is a suitable substate indicator that eliminates the chief failures of single Gaussian models for the distribution of electrostatic interactions and of quadratic models of the electrostatic contribution to the excess chemical potential. These results should improve calculations of ionic chemical processes in water, i.e., acid\xe2\x88\x92base chemistry, in particular those involving organic acids such as proteins and nucleic acids. The multistate Gaussian approach provides a specific and effective alternative to commonly discussed electrostriction and dielectric saturation modifications of dielectric continuum models. Moreover, the representation of complex energy distributions by a sum of simpler distributions based on structural substates is general and should be applicable in a variety of thermodynamic problems of solution chemistry.

"N\xe2\x88\x92H stretch region IR spectroscopy has been used to probe the hydrogen bond-donating properties of six structurally related secondary amides in which the amide group is flanked by sterically bulky groups. For three of the compounds, solid state IR analysis reveals N\xe2\x88\x92H stretch bands >3400 cm-1, which suggests the absence of intermolecular N\xe2\x88\x92H--OC hydrogen bonds. Crystallographic data for these three amides confirm the absence of a standard N\xe2\x88\x92H--OC interaction. For the other three amides, N\xe2\x88\x92H stretch bands in the range 3370\xe2\x88\x923290 cm-1 suggest the occurrence of intermolecular N\xe2\x88\x92H--OC hydrogen bonds in the solid state, but high quality crystals could not be grown. Steric hindrance to hydrogen bond donation by these amides is manifested in IR data obtained in DMSO:\xe2\x80\x89 although this solvent is a strong hydrogen bond acceptor, N\xe2\x88\x92H stretch bands are observed for both solvent-hydrogen bonded and non-hydrogen bonded amide groups. The amides described here and related compounds should be useful for calibrating spectroscopic methods that are intended to detect hydrogen bond formation. "
"Circular dichroism and calorimetry have been used to study the melting of self-assembled phospholipid tubules in alcohol/water solutions. The tubules are found to melt either continuously or discontinuously, depending on the type of alcohol, the alcohol/water ratio, and the lipid concentration. At high proportions of alcohol and low lipid concentrations, the ellipticity continuously decreases with temperature and a very broad peak in the specific heat is observed. In solutions with lower proportions of alcohol or large lipid concentrations, a large drop in ellipticity is accompanied by a sharp peak in the specific heat when the acyl chains disorder. The CD and specific heat measurements can be explained in terms of two distinct thermodynamic processes:\xe2\x80\x89 the discontinuous melting is a first-order transition of the lipid bilayers from the ordered L\xce\xb2\xe2\x80\x98 phase to the disordered L\xce\xb1 phase, while the continuous melting reflects an increase in the lipid solubility with temperature. These results show that the solvent has an important effect on the thermodynamics of lipid tubules, and that circular dichroism is a sensitive probe of tubule thermodynamics. "
"We describe 3D solid state MAS NMR experiments which separate chemical shifts in one 15N and two 13C dimensions. The polarization transfer from 1H to 15N, and subsequently to 13C, is accomplished with recently developed techniques which overcome the shortcomings of constant amplitude Hartmann\xe2\x88\x92Hahn cross polarization. Homonuclear (13C\xe2\x88\x9213C) recoupling is performed with the MELODRAMA sequence. In the 2D 13C\xe2\x88\x9213C spectra of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), successive MELODRAMA transfers propagate 13C magnetization around the five 13C\'s of the ribose ring, and the cross-peaks from successive transfer steps exhibit the negative/positive/negative... pattern expected from the double quantum polarization transfer process. The 3D 15N\xe2\x88\x9213C\xe2\x88\x9213C spectrum of uniformly-15N,13C-labeled histidine consists of 13C\xe2\x88\x9213C planes separated by 15N chemical shifts. The 2D planes are asymmetric since in many cases the polarization giving rise to each cross-peak originates on only one nuclear spin of the coupled pair. 3D 15N\xe2\x88\x9213C\xe2\x88\x9213C spectra of this type should be useful for dispersing overlapping spectra of peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids.

"A detailed analysis of backbone amide NH chemical shift temperature gradients (\xce\x94\xce\xb4/\xce\x94T values) for proteins and highly cross-linked peptides reveals that hydrogen-bonded exchange-protected NHs are characterized by \xce\x94\xce\xb4/\xce\x94T values of \xe2\x88\x922.0 \xc2\xb1 1.4 ppb/\xc2\xb0C while exposed NHs typically display gradients of \xe2\x88\x926.0 \xe2\x86\x92 \xe2\x88\x928.5 ppb/\xc2\xb0C; however, numerous exceptions to these generalizations occur. For partially folded peptides (rather than proteins), exceptions are more common than concordance with this rule; \xce\x94\xce\xb4/\xce\x94T values ranging from \xe2\x88\x9228 to +12 ppb/\xc2\xb0C have been observed. In the case of the peptide systems for which exchange protection data is available, the common practice of assuming that a \xce\x94\xce\xb4/\xce\x94T value less negative than \xe2\x88\x924 ppb/\xc2\xb0C indicates that the NH is sequestered from solvent is shown to have zero predictive validity. The analysis of the data for partially folded peptides, protein fragments, and other peptides which are expected to display minimal structuring reveals a significant correlation between \xce\x94\xce\xb4/\xce\x94T and the deviation of \xce\xb4NH from the random coil reference shift. The analysis was facilitated by plotting NH chemical shift deviations (NH-CSD) versus the \xce\x94\xce\xb4/\xce\x94T values. Using such plots, slow-exchanging hydrogen-bonded sites in proteins can be determined with much higher confidence than using the value of the gradient alone. For peptides, the occurrence of large shift deviations and abnormal gradients are diagnostic for partial structuring at lower temperatures which becomes increasingly randomized on warming. A good correlation coefficient (R \xe2\x89\xa5 0.75) for NH-CSD and \xce\x94\xce\xb4/\xce\x94T values indicates that essentially all of the NH shift deviation from reference values is due to the concerted formation of a single structured state on cooling. Correlation coefficients greater than 0.95 were observed for both helix and \xce\xb2-hairpin forming peptides. The slope of the correlation plot (parts per thousand/\xc2\xb0C) is a measure of the decrease in the population of the structured state upon warming. A detailed model which rationalizes the effects of conformational equilibria upon NH shifts is presented. A positive \xce\x94Cp for unfolding is required to rationalize the linearity of \xce\xb4NH with temperature that is routinely observed for partially structured peptides. This analysis suggests that ordered states of short peptides achieve significant populations in water only when the hydrophobic effect favors the structured state. This conclusion is pertinent to the current questions concerning the temporal sequence of secondary versus tertiary structure formation during protein folding. Further, it is suggested that the use of NMR parameters (scalar and dipolar couplings) to derive the structural preferences of protein fragments which might serve a \xe2\x80\x9cseeding\xe2\x80\x9d role in the folding pathway is justified only when the CSD/gradient plot displays both a correlation coefficient greater than 0.70 and significant NH-CSD values (|CSD| > 0.3).

"Compared to that of model polyurethane 8 from the reaction of tetra(ethylene glycol) (6) and 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-methylenebis(p-phenyl isocyanate) (7) under the same polymerization conditions, polydispersities (PDI) of copolyurethanes 9\xe2\x88\x9211 incorporating bis(5-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-phenylene)-32-crown-10 (5) as comonomer were significantly higher; for these branched polymers, the PDI increased with feed ratio of 5 vs 6 up to Mw/Mn = 24 for 75% of 5. This constitutes an original method to control branching. The branching units in 9\xe2\x88\x9211 are main chain rotaxanes formed with H-bonding between the ether moieties of macrocycle 5 and \xe2\x88\x92OH groups as a driving force and thus are mechanically linked, as directly proven by 1H NMR spectra, NOESY, and complexation studies with a bipyridinium salt. The cavity of 5 acts as a \xe2\x80\x9ctopological functionality\xe2\x80\x9d. Since solvent can either allow or disfavor such H-bonding, polymeric topology, branched or linear, can be controlled by the proper choice of solvent. Indeed, although homopolyurethanes were prepared from the reaction of 5 and 7 under the same conditions otherwise, 12a made in diglyme had very high PDI and was highly branched, while the PDI of 12b made in DMSO was low, close to that of model polyurethane 8, and thus it was linear. In addition, 12c from melt polymerization of 5 and 7 is believed to be physically cross-linked since it is not soluble in common solvents for 12a and 12b. Therefore, a novel strategy for controlling polymeric topology simply by reaction conditions to afford mechanically linked network and branched polymeric materials with controllable PDI, which are essentially three-dimensional main chain polyrotaxanes, is demonstrated.

"Selenothioic acid S-alkyl esters were synthesized from the reaction of terminal acetylenes with n-butyllithium, selenium, and alkanethiols in moderate to high yields. The use of substituted benzenethiols or (triphenylsilyl)acetylene allowed for the isolation of S-aryl esters. The synthesis of \xce\xb1-aryl selenothioic acid S-alkyl esters was attained by the acid-catalyzed reaction of selenoacetic acid Se-alkynyl esters with thiols in good yields. 77Se NMR studies showed that the chemical shifts in a series of the esters were downfield of that in selenoester by about 500 ppm and were upfield of that in selenoketone by about 600 ppm. In the visible spectra the absorptions of the esters were observed at about 340 and 568 nm. X-ray molecular structure analyses of \xce\xb1-silyl esters showed that the bond distances in the selenocarbonyl group were 1.792 and 1.785 \xc3\x85, respectively. The formation of 1,3-diselenetane was confirmed from the decomposed products of S-phenyl ester. The trend for the stability of selenothioic acid S-esters is discussed on the basis of these synthetic results. "
"GTD-43, a polypeptide with 43 amino acid residues, has been designed to fold into a hairpin helix-loop-helix motif that can dimerize to form a four-helix bundle. The mean residue ellipticity is \xe2\x88\x9221000 deg cm2 dmol-1, and the magnitude is independent of pH in the interval of 2.4\xe2\x88\x924.6. The chemical shift dispersion of the amide proton and methyl regions of the 1H NMR spectrum is only slightly less than that of Interleukin-4, a naturally occurring four-helix bundle, and much larger than those reported for molten globule structures. The temperature dependence of the 1H NMR spectrum shows that GTD-43 is in slow exchange on the NMR time scale and that the temperature interval for thermal denaturation is narrow. These spectroscopic probes show that GTD-43 exhibits remarkable structural characteristics for a de novo designed four-helix bundle, and the structural basis for the observed properties has now been determined. GTD-43 folds into a symmetric dimer, and the secondary structure as well as the formation of the hairpin helix-loop-helix motif has been established from NMR spectroscopy. GTD-43 has been designed to form complementary hydrophobic interfaces between the helices, and an aromatic ensemble consisting of Phe10, Trp13, and Phe34 has been incorporated in the interior of the hydrophobic core to restrict the dynamics and give rise to a well-defined tertiary structure. The interaction between the residues in the aromatic ensemble has been established from the observation of a number of long-range NOEs. The formation of a well-defined tertiary structure in the region of the Phe-Trp-Phe residues has been demonstrated by slow amide proton exchange rates and Trp fluorescence. This is the first report of a designed hydrophobic core in a four-helix bundle based on aromatic residues, and the structural property of GTD-43 suggests that the design principle is of general applicability in the de novo design of proteins.

"The first enantioselective total synthesis of the hexacyclopropane natural product U-106305, which is produced by Streptomyces sp. UC 11136, is described in full detail. Considerations on the biosynthesis of U-106305 and its close resemblance to the pentacyclopropane bacterial metabolite FR-900848 (10) led to the proposal that its previously unknown stereostructure should be represented as 11. The central C2-symmetrical quinquecyclopropane unit of 11 was assembled by repeatedly using a three-step cyclopropane \xe2\x80\x9chomologation\xe2\x80\x9d sequence in an efficient bidirectional approach. Desymmetrized quinquecyclopropane 23 was converted to dienol 13 which was monocyclopropanated stereo- and regioselectively to provide hexacyclopropane 25. Deoxygenation was achieved by conversion to thioether 29 and desulfurization. The synthesis was completed by a one-pot deprotection\xe2\x88\x92oxidation\xe2\x88\x92Wittig olefination sequence to give 11. The synthetically derived material was found to be identical in all respects to an authentic sample of U-106305 thus establishing the stereochemical identity of this natural product for the first time. In the course of our studies, several oligocyclopropane derivatives were found to be crystalline compounds and their structures were determined by X-ray crystallography. Among others, X-ray structures of two diastereomeric heptecyclopropanes 27 and 28 are presented. The synthesis of five analogs of U-106305 including the structural hybrid with FR-900848 (41) are described. An approach to FR-900848 (10) using a late desymmetrization of a C2-symmetrical quatercyclopropane tetraene 52 is outlined. "
"A family of silica molecular sieves with lamellar frameworks and hierarchical structure (denoted MSU-V) was assembled from homogeneous solutions of neutral H2N(CH2)nNH2 bolaamphiphiles (n = 12\xe2\x88\x9222) as the structure directors and tetraethylorthosilicate as the inorganic precursor. Optimal lamellar order was observed for four as-synthesized and calcined (550 \xc2\xb0C) mesostructures when they were assembled at the following reaction temperatures (T, \xc2\xb0C) and surfactant/silica ratios (R) of T = 25 \xc2\xb0C, R = 0.26 (C12); T = 45 \xc2\xb0C, R = 0.20 (C16); T = 55 \xc2\xb0C, R = 0.15 (C18); T = 55 \xc2\xb0C, R = 0.11 (C22). MSU-V silica assembled from the short C12 alkyl chain bolaamphiphile exhibited gallery-confined micropores (1.3 nm), but the derivatives prepared from the longer C16\xe2\x88\x92C22 diamines showed gallery-confined mesopores. As the alkyl chain length of the bolaamphiphile surfactant increased from C16 to C22, the size of the gallery-confined mesopores increased from 2.0 to 2.7 nm. The described synthetic strategy afforded hierarchical MSU-V structures with biomimetic multilamellar vesicular particle architectures. Distorted vesicular, plate, and spiral-ribbon shaped particles also were observed, particularly for the lamellar silica assembled from the C16 bolaamphiphile. The variation in morphologies was attributed to agitation effects during synthesis. MSU-V silica assembled from the C22 diamine was the least stable member of the series and partially decomposed upon calcination. Remarkably, surfactant removal by calcination did not affect the biomembrane-like, hollow disk morphology of the original as-synthesized C22 product. This bolaamphiphile assembly approach provides new opportunities for the preparation of lamellar mesoporous molecular sieves with hierarchical structures specifically tailored to applications as diverse as sorbents, catalysts, sensors, bone implants, and nanoscale devices.

"The dinuclear CS2 complex [Pd2(\xce\xbc-PtBu2)(\xce\xbc,\xce\xb72:\xce\xb72-CS2)(PPh3)2]BF4, (2)BF4, reacts with Me4NI to yield the neutral tetranuclear Pd(I) derivative Pd4(\xce\xbc-PtBu2)2(\xce\xbc4-CS2)(PPh3)2I2 (4), which has been characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Its unusual molecular structure with a formally hexacoordinate carbon atom, as well as that of (2)+ with a planar tetracoordinate carbon can be explained on the basis of fragment MO considerations and EHMO model calculations. The reaction proceeds stepwise, with the relatively fast substitution of CS2 by the iodide ion giving the intermediate complex Pd2(\xce\xbc-PtBu2)(\xce\xbc-I)(PPh3)2 (3). The latter further reacts slowly with free CS2 to give complex 4 and free PPh3. Complex 3 was also prepared and isolated pure by reacting [Pd2(\xce\xbc-PtBu2)(PPh3)3]BF4 with Me4NI. "
"Treatment of the titanacyclopentadiene compound [Ti(OC6H3Ph2-2,6)2(C4Et4)] (3) (OC6H3Ph2-2,6 = 2,6-diphenylphenoxide) with olefins leads to the formation of a variety of stable titanacyclopentane derivatives along with one equivalent of substituted 1,3-cyclohexadiene. The structural and spectroscopic properties of the ethylene product [Ti(OC6H3Ph2-2,6)2(CH2)4] (4) show a ground state titanacyclopentane structure, but facile fragmentation on the NMR time scale to form a bis(ethylene) complex has been detected. The substituted products [Ti(OC6H3Ph2-2,6)2(C4H6R2)] (R = Me, 5; Et, 6; Ph, 7) formed from \xce\xb1-olefins RCHCH2 exist as a mixture of regio- and stereoisomers in hydrocarbon solution. Analysis of a crystal obtained from solutions of 7 showed a trans-2,5-diphenyl-titanacyclopentane ring to be present in the solid state. Alternative routes to the titanacyclopentane compounds involve treatment of the dichlorides [Ti(OC6H3Ph2-2,6)2Cl2] (1) or [Ti(OC6HPh4-2,3,5,6)2Cl2] (2) with either sodium amalgam (2 Na per Ti) or 2 equiv of BunLi in the presence of the substrate olefin. Using these conditions the titanabicyclic compounds [(ArO)2Ti{CH2CH(C4H8)CHCH2}] (ArO = OC6H3Ph2-2,6, 10; OC6HPh4-2,3,5,6, 11) can be obtained by intramolecular coupling of 1,7-octadiene. The spectroscopic properties of 10 and 11 as well as a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of 11 show an exclusive trans stereochemistry is present. Thermolysis of 10 or 11 in the presence of excess 1,7-octadiene leads to the catalytic formation of 2-(methylmethylene)cyclohexane (80%) along with E,Z isomers of 2,6-octadiene (20%). A kinetic study shows the reaction to be zero order in diene with activation parameters, \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = +18.7(5) kcal mol-1 and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9226(5) eu. The diphenyltitanacyclopentane 7 will catalyze the dimerization of styrene to trans-1,3-diphenylbut-1-ene followed by isomerization to 1,3-diphenylbut-2-ene. This result shows that although a 2,5-diphenyl regiochemistry was observed in the solid state, styrene dimerization occurs via the 2,4-diphenyltitanacyclopentane intermediate. The facile fragmentation of these titanacyclopentane compounds accounts for the products observed in a number of reactions. Addition of phosphine donor ligands (L) leads to a series of titanacyclopropane compounds [Ti(OC6H3Ph2-2,6)2(\xce\xb72-CHRCH2)(L)] (R = H, 14; Me, 15; Et, 16; Ph, 17) along with 1 equiv of olefin. The solid-state structure of the ethylene complex 14 shows the C2H4 unit lies approximately coplanar with the Ti\xe2\x88\x92PMe3 bond. This structure is not only maintained in solution but slow olefin rotation is observed on the NMR time scale. In the case of the \xce\xb1-olefin products, two isomers are detected by 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectroscopy. Addition of Ph2CO or PhCHNR (R = Ph, CH2Ph) to the titanacyclopentane and titanacyclopropane compounds leads to different products depending upon the reagent and reaction conditions. These can be classified as 2-oxa(aza)titanacycloheptanes, 2-oxa(aza)titanacyclopentanes, 2,5-dioxa(diaza)titanacyclopentanes, and examples of 2-oxatitanacyclopropane (\xce\xb72-ketone) and 2,7-dioxatitanacycloheptane compounds. The 2-azatitanacyclopentane compounds [Ti(OC6H3Ph2-2,6)2{(PhCH2)NCH(Ph)CH2CH2}] (30) and trans-[Ti(OC6H3Ph2-2,6)2{(Ph)NCH(Ph)CH2CH(Ph)}] (31) react with alkynes to produce the corresponding 2-azatitanacyclopent-4-ene which hydrolyze to produce a stoichiometric equivalent of allylamine. Reaction of 30 with benzonitrile produces the 2,5-diazatitanacyclopent-2-ene [Ti(OC6H3Ph2-2,6)2(NCPhCHPhNR)] (35) along with ethylene. "
"The synthesis of RuCl(CO)(NO)L2 (L = PtBu2Me) and replacement of Cl- by BF4-, CO, CH3CN, H2O, F-, and H- are reported. NaBArF4 (ArF = 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3) removes halide to produce the four-coordinate 16-electron cation Ru(NO)(CO)L2+, shown by X-ray diffraction to have a nonplanar structure symptomatic of greater back bonding than isoelectronic Ru(CO)2L2. Variable-temperature 1H NMR studies of the tBu groups in [Ru(NO)(CO)L2](BArF4) show a \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 (100 \xc2\xb0C) for inversion through planar Ru of 19.1 kcal/mol. Ru(\xce\xb71-BF4)(CO)(NO)L2 is shown by X-ray diffraction to have a square-pyramidal structure with apical bent NO. The IR frequencies of NO and CO are analyzed to conclude that all five-coordinate species except Ru(NO)(CO)2L2+ and RuH(NO)(CO)L2 have bent nitrosyls; these last two have linear NO. RuX(CO)(NO)(PH3)2+ (X = Cl-, BF4-, H-, no ligand, NCH, CO) was calculated with ab initio calculations at the Becke3LYP level. Depending on the nature of X, one minimum (square pyramid with bent NO) or two minima (square pyramid with bent NO and trigonal bipyramid with linear NO) have been located. The difference in energy between these two structures follows closely the NO vibrational frequency. While the frontier between bent and linear NO is indistinct, the results clearly show that \xcf\x80-donor ligands stabilize 16-electron unsaturated species. "
"The synthesis and characterization of ordered, lamellar, iron oxide/surfactant composites in which the iron oxide layer thickness is selectively varied are presented. These new materials are prepared by the controlled precipitation and hydrolysis of aqueous iron cations into self-assembled iron/surfactant arrays. The use of redox chemistry to alter the solubility of iron oxide and thus control hydrolysis, solubility, and inorganic layer thickness is a key feature of the synthesis procedure. The composites show a layered structure as determined by X-ray diffraction and can be produced with approximately 3 to nearly 20 \xc3\x85 of iron oxide in alternation with surfactant bilayers. For samples with 10 \xc3\x85 or thicker iron oxide layers, magnetic susceptibility measurements and M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectroscopy indicate the presence of superantiferromagnetic domain structures with smaller domains observed in samples with thinner layers. The results are a first step toward the simple design of hierarchical nanostructured magnetic materials using cooperative, three-dimensional inorganic/organic self-organization. "
"A new class of clusters, sulfide-bridged double cubanes containing the units MFe3(\xce\xbc3-S)4 (M = Fe, Mo), has been investigated as possible synthetic precursors to the iron\xe2\x88\x92molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) of nitrogenase. Clusters containing the symmetric core structures [Fe4Q4-Q-Fe4Q4]2+ (11\xe2\x88\x9213, Q = S, Se) have been prepared by the coupling of separate cubane clusters ([Fe4S4Cl4]2-, [Fe4Q4(LS3)Cl]2-, where LS3 = 1,3,5-tris((4,6-dimethyl-3-mercaptophenyl)thio)-2,4,6-tris(p-tolylthio)benzenate(3\xe2\x88\x92)). Similarly, the cuboidal cluster [VFe4S6(PEt3)4Cl] was coupled to form [VFe4S6(PEt3)4]2S (14). The cluster [(Fe4S4Cl3)2S]4- (11) is the first structurally proven example of the class (Challen, P. R.; Koo, S.-M.; Dunham, W. R.; Coucouvanis, D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990, 112, 2455). Bridged structures have also been established crystallographically for {[Fe4Se4(LS3)]2Se}4- (13) and 14. Other criteria for identification of this structure developed using 11\xe2\x88\x9214 are coupled redox processes in cyclic voltammetry and the detection of intact double cubane ions by electrospray mass spectrometry. For the coupling of heterometal cubanes, the Mo site was protected by chelation with Meida (N-methylimidodiacetate(2\xe2\x88\x92)) as in [(Meida)MoFe3S4Cl3]2- (6), thereby directing the bridging reaction to the Fe sites. The structures of two [VFe3S4]2+ cubane clusters containing the tricoordinate (Meida)V fragment are reported. The reaction system 6/Li2S afforded {[(Meida)MoFe3S4Cl2]2S}4- (15). The symmetrical sulfide-bridged double cubane structure of 15 has been established by the electrochemical and mass spectrometric criteria and by the existence of the four isomers consistent with this structure. The equimolar reaction system 6/[Fe4S4Cl4]2-/Li2S produced a mixture of {[(Meida)MoFe3S4Cl2]S(Fe4S4Cl3)}4- (17), 15, and 11. Cluster 17 is also formed in the system 15/[Fe4S4Cl4]2-. The unsymmetrical sulfide-bridged double cubane structure of 17 was established by mass spectrometry and detection of the two isomers consistent with this structure. In the first reaction system, the product mole ratio 17:15 \xe2\x89\x88 3:1 is explained in terms of differential steric hindrance of conformations arising from rotation around the Fe\xe2\x88\x92S\xe2\x88\x92Fe bridge. The core composition of double cubane 15 (Mo2Fe6S9) approaches that of FeMoco (MoFe7S9). The core composition of 17 is exactly the same as FeMoco; 17 is the first synthetic cluster with this property. "
"The reaction of ferrocene with molten imidazole at 150 \xc2\xb0C yielded pale yellow crystals of composition [Fe3(imid)6(imidH)2]x. Crystals of [Fe3(imid)6(imidH)2]x are monoclinic, a = 10.5912(9), b = 12.958(2), c = 10.617(1) \xc3\x85; \xce\xb2 = 92.696(9)\xc2\xb0; Z = 2; space group P21/c. The structure was solved by Patterson methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares procedures to R = 0.033 and Rw = 0.031 for 2260 reflections with I \xe2\x89\xa5 3\xcf\x83(F2). The structure consists of chains of tetrahedral iron centers cross-linked via octahedral iron ions to generate a 3-D array. All of the iron centers are bridged to four other metal centers via imidazolate ions, the two remaining (trans) coordination positions of the octahedral centers being occupied by neutral imidazole molecules. Magnetic susceptibilities on powdered samples were measured over the temperature range 2\xe2\x88\x92300 K and at fields ranging from 0 to 55\xe2\x80\x89000 G. The compound exhibits antiferromagnetic coupling along chains of tetrahedrally coordinated iron centers. A canted spin structure leads to weak ferromagnetism at temperatures below a magnetic phase transition temperature of 17 K. Upon cycling the applied magnetic field between +55\xe2\x80\x89000 and \xe2\x88\x9255\xe2\x80\x89000 G at 4.8 K, a hysteresis loop was obtained with a remnant magnetization of 2500 cm3 G mol-1 and a coercive field of 200 G.

"The rates of exchange of the 2,4,6-trimethylphenolate ion between dimeric lithium 2,4,6-trimethylphenolate-d9 and a series of 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl esters [2,4,6-(CH3)3C6H2COOCH2R; R = CH2CH3, CH3O, Ph, 4-CH3Ph, 4-CF3Ph, 4-ClPh, 4-CH3OPh, 2-pyridyl, and 4-pyridyl] have been determined in dioxolane, THF, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, and pyridine. The reactions are first order in the lithium phenolate showing that the dimer reacts without dissociation. The rates of transesterification increase with increasing solvent donicity in contrast to the reaction of tetrameric lithium 3,5-dimethylphenolate. For all the esters, except R = 2-pyridyl, the rates of transesterification exhibit a linear correlation with their rates of hydrolysis. The 2-pyridyl ester exhibits an abnormally high rate of transesterification, which is attributed to a complex-induced proximity effect. Tetrameric lithium 3,5-dimethylphenolate undergoes transesterification less rapidly in the presence of hexamethylphosphoric triamide (0.25\xe2\x88\x921.6 equiv), a result consistent with a mechanism involving initial coordination of the ester to a lithium ion in the tetramer.

"Selective 2H-, 13C-, and 17O-isotope labeling of the tyrosine amino acid has been used to map the unpaired \xcf\x80-electron spin-density distribution of the UV-generated neutral l-tyrosine phenoxy radical in alkaline frozen solution. The use of 13C and 17O labels allowed accurate determination of the full spin-density distribution and provided more insight in the geometrical structure of the neutral tyrosine radical in vitro. Simulations of the X-band (9.2 GHz) and Q-band (34.8 GHz) EPR powder spectra yielded the principal components of the 1H-, 13C-, and 17O-hyperfine tensors. For the two \xce\xb2-methylene hydrogens, a static conformational distribution of the dihedral angles (90\xc2\xb0 < \xce\xb81 < 60\xc2\xb0 and 60\xc2\xb0 < \xce\xb82 < 30\xc2\xb0) was taken into account. The major proton hyperfine interactions and the principal g values for the neutral tyrosine radical, obtained from selectively deuterated samples, are consistent with literature values. The spin density at the specifically labeled postitions (C1\xe2\x80\x98, C2\xe2\x80\x98, C3\xe2\x80\x98, C4\xe2\x80\x98, C5\xe2\x80\x98, O4\xe2\x80\x98) was evaluated from the anisotropy of the 13C- and 17O-hyperfine tensors. A quantitative analysis of the positions C3\xe2\x80\x98 and C5\xe2\x80\x98 provided evidence for a planar distortion of the aromatic ring at these positions. 17O enrichment of the phenol oxygen O4\xe2\x80\x98 of the tyrosine radical unambiguously showed that the spin density at this oxygen is 0.26 \xc2\xb1 0.01. From the relatively large delocalization of the spin density over the carbonyl group of the tyrosine aromatic ring system, it is concluded that the C4\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92O4\xe2\x80\x98 bond has a double-bond character. The experimentally determined spin-density distribution is compared with several computational calculated spin-density distributions found in the literature. The isotropic 13C-hyperfine interactions are discussed in the framework of the Karplus\xe2\x88\x92Fraenkel theory. This theory proved to be accurate for the determination of sign and magnitude of the isotropic 13C- and 17O-hyperfine interactions. "
"The trisaccharide \xce\xb2-d-Glcp-(1\xe2\x86\x922)-\xce\xb2-d-Glcp-(1\xe2\x86\x923)-\xce\xb1-d-Glcp-OMe has been studied by Langevin dynamics (LD) simulations and NMR spectroscopy including measurement of transglycosidic 3JC,H coupling constants, 3JH,OH coupling constants, temperature dependence of the chemical shift of hydroxyl protons, and 2D NOESY and T-ROESY experiments as well as their 1D DPFGSE analogues. A folded conformer at the \xcf\x86H dihedral angle of the (1\xe2\x86\x922)-linkage observed in the LD simulation was corroborated by experimental NMR data, in particular spatial proximity of hydroxyl protons in nonadjacent sugar residues as deduced from a 2D T-ROESY experiment. The results from the present study with an \xe2\x80\x9canti\xe2\x80\x9d \xcf\x86H conformer show that oligosaccharides exhibit large conformational flexibility under certain conditions and that this inherent property needs to be taken into account in the analysis of carbohydrate structure. "
"The dependence of the 13C, 15N, and 1H isotropic NMR chemical shifts on amine substitution of aromatic ring systems are examined both experimentally and by DFT/GIAO (density functional theory/gauge including atomic orbitals) methods. There are large, monotonic decreases in the chemical shifts at odd-numbered (ortho and para) pyrimidine ring positions which do not occur at the even-numbered (ipso and meta) atoms as amine groups progressively replace hydrogens at the latter positions. This behavior parallels the computed 2pz electron densities which for the pyrimidine series increase monotonically at N1, N3, and C5 but exhibit small changes at the C2, C4, and C6 positions. Identical trends are noted for the aminobenzenes. The ring atom chemical shifts and 2pz electron densities at ortho and para (but not meta) positions are quite sensitive to the orientations of the amine groups which are pyramidalized as the result of balance between delocalization with the ring and the use of strongly directed sp3 orbitals at the nitrogen. The calculated results show that the barriers to amine group torsional and inversion motions are low, but averaging the chemical shifts over these appears to be relatively unimportant. Differences between the DFT and Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock-based chemical shifts show that electron correlation effects monotonically increase with the number of NH2 substituents. "
"Cellular and viral RNAs, synthesized by RNA polymerase II, have a unique chemical structure at their 5\xe2\x80\x98 termini, 5\xe2\x80\x98 m7GpppNNN... 3\xe2\x80\x98, referred to as the 5\xe2\x80\x98 cap. This structure plays a pivotal role in several processes of mRNA metabolism, including translation and turnover. Consequently, the 5\xe2\x80\x98 cap is a potential target for antisense directed chemistries. In this study the cyclen based lanthanide complexes, Eu(THED)3+, Eu(s-THP)3+, and La(TCMC)3+, were evaluated for their reactivity upon the 5\xe2\x80\x98 cap structure. Only Eu(THED)3+ showed significant reactivity upon a 5\xe2\x80\x98 capped RNA:antisense substrate (86% decapitation after 4 h in the presence of a 0.10 mM complex at 37 \xc2\xb0C, pH 7.4). Product analysis of the Eu(THED)3+ reaction upon the capped monoribonucleotide, m7GpppG, showed nucleotide diphosphates, GDP and m7GDP, and nucleotide monophosphate THED adducts, GMP-THED and m7GMP-THED, as major products. The isolated adducts were characterized as phosphodiesters comprising a hydroxyethyl pendant group attached to the phosphate group. Pseudo-first-order rate constants (k0) were 5.3 \xc3\x97 10-5 and 4.5 \xc3\x97 10-5 s-1 for cleavage of GpppG and m7GpppG, respectively, at a complex concentration of 0.31 mM and substrate concentration of 0.031 mM (pH 7.4, 37 \xc2\xb0C). Cleavage of GpppG was first order in Eu(THED)3+ for complex concentrations ranging from 0.158 to 1.26 mM. A plot of k1 versus concentration gave a second-order rate constant of 0.17 M-1 s-1. Cleavage of the 5\xe2\x80\x98 cap structure by Eu(THED)3+ is proposed to occur by a nucleophilic displacement reaction, where the nucleophile is the metal activated hydroxyethyl group of the THED ligand.

"In order to determine whether there is an orientation preference of pyrrole\xe2\x88\x92imidazole (Py\xe2\x88\x92Im) polyamide dimers with respect to the 5\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x923\xe2\x80\x98 direction of the backbone in the DNA helix, equilibrium association constants (Ka) were determined for a series of six-ring hairpin polyamides which differ with respect to substitution at the N and C termini. Affinity cleaving experiments using hairpin polyamides of core sequence composition ImPyPy-\xce\xb3-PyPyPy with an EDTA\xc2\xb7Fe(II) moiety at the C-terminus reveal a single binding orientation at each formal match site, 5\xe2\x80\x98-(A,T)G(A,T)3-3\xe2\x80\x98 and 5\xe2\x80\x98-(A,T)C(A,T)3-3\xe2\x80\x98. A positive charge at the C-terminus and no substitution at the N-terminus imidazole affords the maximum binding orientation preference, calculated from Ka(5\xe2\x80\x98-TGTTA-3\xe2\x80\x98)/Ka(5\xe2\x80\x98-TCTTA-3\xe2\x80\x98), with the N-terminal end of each three-ring subunit located toward the 5\xe2\x80\x98 side of the target DNA strand. Removal of the positive charge, rearrangement of the positive charge to the N-terminus or substitution at the N-terminal imidazole decreases the orientation preference. These results suggest that second generation design principles superimposed on the simple pairing rules can further optimize the sequence-specificity of Py-Im polyamides for double helical DNA. "
"An efficient and general method for the solid-phase synthesis of glycopeptides containing an O-linked sialyl-Lewis-X (SLex) tetrasaccharide is described. Using a combined chemoenzymatic approach, the first synthesis of an unnatural \xce\xb2-O-linked SLex attached to a partial sequence of the mucin domain of the L-selectin ligand MAdCAM-1, was demonstrated. A resin-bound O-glycoconjugate was synthesized from a new Fmoc-threonine building block which carries an O-unprotected \xce\xb2-linked N-acetylglucoseamine (GlcNAc) moiety. The acid- and base-stable HYCRON-linker enabled the complete removal of all protecting groups on solid phase. Glycosyltransferases were employed to extend the glycan on supported and unsupported O-GlcNAc-octapeptide substrates. The acid- and base-sensitive O-glycopeptides were released under practically neutral conditions, taking advantage of the palladium(0)-catalyzed cleavage of the allylic linkage. Studies toward the selective O-deacetylation of ester-linked glycopeptides possessing O-acetyl-protected carbohydrates are also reported. "
"Two photosystems are developed to harvest visible-light photons into electrons via sequential electron transfer processes. Photosystem-A (PS-A) consisted of DCA as light harvesting electron acceptor and Ph3P as sacrificial electron donor, whereas photosystem-B (PS-B) employed DCA as usual electron acceptor, DMN as a primary electron donor, and ascorbic acid as a secondary and sacrificial electron donor. \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-Unsaturated ketones are utilized as secondary electron acceptors. The design of these photosystems is based on the thermodynamic feasibility of electron transfer between each participating components. Electron transfer from DCA\xe2\x80\xa2- to \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated ketones leads to their \xce\xb2-activation as carbon centered radicals which cyclizes efficiently to tethered activated olefins. Cyclization with a nonactivated olefin is found to be moderate. The cyclization stereochemistries have been illustrated by studying the PET activation of 5 and 21. The exclusive trans-stereochemistry observed in 8 is explained by considering the thermodynamic equilibration of initially formed syn-intermediate 10 from 5. The isolation of trace amount of 9 in this reaction substantiates the syn-intermediacy as primary intermediate which is further confirmed by the isolation of 25 from 21. Formation of 25 suggests that wherever the syn-intermediate is thermodynamically more stable, it invariably undergoes further cyclization to geometrically well-placed enolate double bond. An interesting observation is made by isolating 9 as a major product from the PET activation of 5 using PS-B. Stabilization of 10 by ascorbic acid is suggested to be the plausible explanation for this unusual observation. Radicals produced by the reductive \xce\xb2-activation of \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated ketones follow well established radical cyclization rules which is exemplified by studying the reactions of 39 and 40. Generality of these cyclizations is demonstrated from the PET reactions of 29\xe2\x88\x9232. Synthesis of 49, an important structural framework of biologically active angularly fused triquinanes, from 48 is included in this study to demonstrate the varied applicability of this strategy. "
"The photoreduction of chloranil (Q) to the hydroquinone (QH2) in benzene by benzhydrols and by related arylmethanols has been investigated. The products of photooxidation of the benzhydrols are benzophenones, in lieu of formation of benzpinacols. Three distinct mechanisms of oxidation\xe2\x88\x92reduction have been identified from quantum yield determinations and laser flash photolysis experiments, including quinone triplet quenching via H-atom and electron transfer paths. Direct excitation of ground state quinone complexes has also been investigated. The quenching of the triplet state of the quinone by benzhydrol proceeds normally (kq = 1.3 \xc3\x97 106 M-1 s-1) and gives semiquinone radical (QH\xe2\x80\xa2, \xce\xbbmax = 435 nm) and the benzhydryl radical (\xce\xbbmax = 535 nm). The latter intermediate decays by pseudo-first-order kinetics through hydrogen atom transfer with ground state quinone (Q). Triplet quenching by bis(4-methoxyphenyl)methanol proceeds at a more rapid rate (kq = 5.5 \xc3\x97 109 M-1 s-1) leading to an intermediate that is identified as the chloranil radical anion (\xce\xbbmax = 450 nm). A similar intermediate is observed on Q quenching by 1-naphthylmethanol and acenapthenol with the appearance of an accompanying naphthalene radical cation absorption (ca. 670 nm). The radical ion transients, which are assigned to contact ion-pairs (triplet excited complexes) of the quinone and the various electron donors, decay to semiquinone radicals (QH\xe2\x80\xa2) by first-order processes occurring in the 100 ns time regime. The transient behavior is interpreted in terms of a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism for photoreduction with benzhydrol and, for the more robust electron donors, a mechanism involving electron transfer followed by proton transfer between geminate radical ions. For the electron transfer donors, ground state charge-transfer (CT) complexes can be observed (\xce\xbbmax ca. 500 nm). Selective CT excitation leads to quinone photoreduction with reduced quantum yield. The results are discussed in terms of the time resolution of sequential electron/proton transfer steps for photogenerated ion-pairs, the occurrence of one photon\xe2\x88\x92two electron transfer photoredox mechanisms, and the kinetically distinct pathways for decay of singlet and triplet intimate radical ion-pairs.

"Electron transfer chain reactions leading to substitution in electronegatively substituted benzene derivatives can be observed with alkylmercury halides in the presence of proton acceptors such as DABCO. Promotion by base involves the abstraction of a proton from the substituted cyclohexadienyl adduct radical to form a radical anion which readily transfers an electron to RHgX with the regeneration of R\xe2\x80\xa2. Aromatic substitutions involving t-Bu\xe2\x80\xa2 are highly regioselective and yield products of only para attack for PhCHO, PhCOCH3, PhCOCMe3, PhCOPh, PhCN, phthalimides, or 1,2-dicyanobenzene. The ortho/para substitution products are observed for isophthaldehyde or 1,3-dicyanobenzene, while 1,4-dicyanobenzene yields the ortho substitution product. At 25\xe2\x88\x9235 \xc2\xb0C substitution by t-Bu\xe2\x80\xa2 ortho to an ester group is not observed and m- or p-cyanobenzoate esters yield only products of substitution ortho to the cyano group. With the isopropyl radical substitution ortho to the ester function is observed with diethyl isophthalate. Intramolecular radical cyclizations of the radical adducts of 1-aryl-4-penten-1-ones leading to \xce\xb1-tetralones is also promoted by the presence of DABCO. When the aryl group contains a para ester function, spirocyclization occurs leading to a rearrangement acyl radical which can be oxidized by t-BuHgCl to the acyl cation and the carboxylic acid. "
"The triazidocarbenium cation, C(N3)3+, was successfully combined with the energetic N(NO2)2- and ClO4- anions in the form of highly energetic salts. The new C(N3)3+BF4- salt was also prepared, and all compounds were characterized by their material balances and vibrational spectroscopy. Electronic structure calculations were carried out for C(N3)3+ at the B3LYP/6-31G*, B3LYP/cc-pVDZ, B3LYP/cc-pVTZ, and HF/cc-pVDZ levels of theory. At all levels, the energy minimum is the planar C3h structure, and the vibrational spectra were assigned and analyzed for this structure. The heats of formation of C(N3)3+N(NO2)2- and C(N3)3+ClO4- were estimated to be endothermic by 252 and 218 kcal mol-1 and explain the high explosive power of these salts. "
"The potent insecticidal agent nodulisporic acid A (1a), representative of a new class of indole terpenes, was isolated from fermentations of a Nodulisporium sp. Nodulisporic acid A was active against the larvae of the blowfly and mosquito at sub-part-per-million levels. The structure followed mainly from a consideration of spectroscopic evidence, including Dunkel\'s computerized 2D INADEQUATE analysis. The relative stereochemistry of the eastern and western hemispheres of 1a and its methyl ester, 1b, were independently determined on the basis of ROESY, NOESY, NOEDS, and Jvic evidence. By employing the same methods, the complete relative stereochemistry was determined by analysis of suitable transformation products, using the reduced \xce\xb2-ketodihydropyrrole ring as a stereochemical bridge between the two zones. These results were confirmed by X-ray analysis of the 7-p-bromobenzoate methyl ester derivative, 1c. The absolute stereochemistry was established by application of the advanced Mosher method to methyl ester 1b. Of biogenetic interest is the presence of a unique isoprenylated indole moiety not previously found in other indole mycotoxins. "
"The organoyttrium complex Cp*2YCH3\xc2\xb7THF (Cp* = C5Me5) has been shown to be an effective precatalyst for the selective sequential cyclization/silylation of 1,6- and 1,7-enynes. The catalyst\'s ability to insert the alkyne in preference to the alkene in a regioselective manner, combined with the high diastereoselectivity of the insertion process, yields a product with only one stereochemistry about the exocyclic olefin. The reaction proceeds under extremely mild conditions with short reaction times. Cyclization of enynes functionalized in the allylic position affords silylated carbocycles with high diastereoselectivities and excellent yields. "
"Catalytic intramolecular cyclopropanation by diazoacetates onto a remote carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon double bond resulting in the formation of 9- to 20-membered ring lactones is reported. When competition exists between proximal allylic and remote olefinic cyclopropanation, macrocyclization is favored by catalysts of increasing electrophilicity:\xe2\x80\x89 Rh2(pfb)4 > Rh2(OAc)4, Cu(MeCN)4PF6 > Rh(cap)4, and Cu(acac)2. Terpene systems, cis-nerolidyl diazoacetate and related structures, malonic ester derivatives, and those with 1,2-benzenedimethanol, pentaerythritol, and cis-2-buten-1,4-diol linkers all undergo cyclopropanation onto the most remote carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon double bond in good yield. Generally, only one cyclopropane diastereoisomer is observed, but increasing ring size allows stereochemistries in macrocyclization reactions that resemble those of their intermolecular cyclopropanation counterparts. In one system (25) macrocyclic addition is accompanied by ylide formation/[2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement resulting in the formation of a 10-membered ring lactone. Overall, few limits to macrocycle formation are evident, and the methodology appears to have general applicability. "
"The carbonyl carbon, carbonyl oxygen, and nitrogen nucleophile isotope effects were measured for the hydrazinolysis of methyl formate at pH 8 and 10. At pH 8, where breakdown of a tetrahedral intermediate to products is rate-determining, the carbonyl carbon isotope effect is k12/k13 = 1.038, the carbonyl oxygen isotope effect is k16/k18 = 1.003, and the nitrogen nucleophile isotope effect is k14/k15 = 0.990. The isotope effects at pH 8 are consistent with a late transition state, which greatly resembles the hydrazide product. At pH 10, where formation of a tetrahedral intermediate is rate-determining, the carbonyl carbon isotope effect is k12/k13 = 1.020, the carbonyl oxygen isotope effect is k16/k18 = 1.004, and the nitrogen nucleophile isotope effect is k14/k15 = 0.9917. These isotope effects are best rationalized in terms of a concerted general base catalyzed nucleophilic attack of hydrazine on methyl formate as the rate-determining step. "
"Several S-alkylthiophenium complexes of the type [Os(NH3)5(4,5-\xce\xb72-L)](OTf)3 (where L = S-alkylthiophenium, S-methylbenzo[b]thiophenium) are prepared by alkylation of the corresponding thiophene complexes. The S-alkylthiophenium species are proposed to undergo rapid and reversible cleavage of the C5\xe2\x88\x92S bond, forming highly electrophilic metallacyclopropene intermediates. Although not directly observable, these vinyl cation intermediates may be trapped with both anionic and neutral nucleophiles affording \xce\xb72-4-(alkylthio)-1,3-butadiene complexes. Treatment of selected 4-(alkylthio)-1,3-butadiene complexes with an oxidant (e.g., DDQ) affords the organic ligand in good yield. "
"Soluble silica reduces aluminum availability and ameliorates toxicity in several biological systems. It has therefore been suggested that these two species strongly interact in solution. However, there is only weak affinity between monomeric silicic acid and aluminum with reported log Keff of between 4 and 6 at pH 7.2. We now show the existence of a soluble low molecular weight form of silica that is nonmonomeric but has an affinity for aluminum at least 1\xe2\x80\x89000\xe2\x80\x89000 times greater than the monomeric form (log Keff = 11.70 \xc2\xb1 0.30 at pH 7.2). This was established by competition, for binding of aluminum, between different preparations of soluble silica and the powerful M3+ chelator, 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone (DMHP). At pH 7.2, this nonmonomeric silica quantitatively displaced one equiv of DMHP for every 34.42 \xc2\xb1 0.77 equiv of total silica, suggesting that the soluble silica that so avidly binds aluminum is an oligomer containing fewer than 35 silicon atoms. The presence of oligomeric or monomeric silica in solution depends on how the solution is prepared. The oligomer is formed when alkali stock solutions of silica (42 mM in this work) are pH neutralized prior to dilution, to physiological and natural levels of soluble silica (<2.5 mM). The diluted oligomeric silica is at least transiently stable (<1 day or >17 days; absence or presence of aluminum) and would compete effectively with endogenous physiological chelators for aluminum, such as citrate (log Keff aluminum citrate = 7.15 at pH 7.2). Oligomeric silica is probably responsible for the many experimental observations on the amelioration of aluminum availability and toxicity, but whether this silica species occurs naturally in the environment or is formed in vivo, remains to be established.

"Template condensation of 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-diaminobiphenyl, 1,4-bis(2-formylphenyl)-1,4-dithiabutane, and copper(II) tetrafluoroborate yields the new macrocyclic compound [CuI(bite)](BF4) (bite = biphenyldiimino dithioether). [CuI(bite)]BF4 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with a = 14.379(3) \xc3\x85, b = 21.370(3) \xc3\x85, c = 8.046(2) \xc3\x85, V = 2534.7(7) \xc3\x853, Z = 4, R1 = 0.045, and R2 = 0.048. The X-ray structure of [CuI(bite)](BF4) reveals distorted tetrahedral N2S2 coordination about copper, with one unusually short Cu\xe2\x88\x92S(thioether) bond of 2.194(2) \xc3\x85. Oxidation of [CuI(bite)](BF4) with nitrosyl tetrafluoroborate gives [CuII(bite)](BF4)2. [CuII(bite)](BF4)2 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I41/a with a = 11.640(2) \xc3\x85, c = 39.527(3) \xc3\x85, V = 5355.6(7) \xc3\x853, Z = 8, R1 = 0.061, and R2 = 0.063. X-ray crystallography of [CuII(bite)](BF4)2 reveals an approximately square planar CuN2S2 structure with two distant axial BF4- anions (Cu\xe2\x88\x92F 2.546(4) \xc3\x85) completing a \xe2\x80\x9cpseudo-octahedral\xe2\x80\x9d coordination sphere. Comparative EXAFS studies of solid samples and acetonitrile solutions of [CuI(bite)](BF4) and [CuII(bite)](BF4)2 demonstrate that the primary coordination environments of both species are the same in solution as in the solid. Copper(I/II) electron self-exchange kinetics measured by 1H NMR line broadening of [CuI(bite)]+ in the presence of [CuII(bite)]2+ reveal an overall first-order process with a rate constant of 21.7(1.9) s-1 at 295 K in acetone-d6. This result represents the first example of fully-gated electron transfer by small-molecule copper(I). The gating process likely involves inversion at sulfur and the tetrahedral \xe2\x86\x92 square planar structural change coincident with electron transfer. Variable-temperature 1H NMR coalescence temperatures for methylene ligand protons of [CuI(bite)](BF4) (287 K) demonstrate possible correlation of fast electron transfer with high ligand mobility for this and related small-molecule copper(I/II) couples. Comparison with other small-molecule copper systems also reveals that fast electron transfer is not always observed with coordination-number-invariance and conserved geometry during redox turnover, contrary to popular interpretations of the entatic state hypothesis for blue-copper protein active sites.

"M\xc3\xb6ssbauer and UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectroscopic measurements of the two diazene-bridged systems [{Fe\xe2\x80\x98NHS4\'}2(N2H2)] (\xe2\x80\x98NHS4\'2- = 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bis(2-mercaptophenylthio)diethylamine(2\xe2\x88\x92)) and [{Fe\xe2\x80\x98S4\'(PPr3)}2(N2H2)] (\xe2\x80\x98S4\'2- = 1,2-bis(2-mercaptophenylthio)ethane(2\xe2\x88\x92)) have been combined with self-consistent-field X\xce\xb1 scattered-wave (SCF-X\xce\xb1 -SW) calculations in order to describe the electronic properties of diazene coordinated to Fe(II)\xe2\x88\x92sulfur centers. For both model systems, the experiments and calculations indicate a Fe(II)\xe2\x88\x92N2H2\xe2\x88\x92Fe(II) structure with Fe(II) low-spin centers. The stabilization of diazene is due to \xcf\x83-donation from its highest occupied MO and \xcf\x80 -backbonding into its lowest unoccupied MO (LUMO). The intense absorption band at approximately 600 nm is ascribed to a charge-transfer transition from metal-d orbitals into the diazene LUMO. Importantly, the diazene LUMO also is the LUMO of the complexes and is located between the fully occupied and empty orbitals of the iron centers. It is concluded that the Fe(II) high-spin configuration present in a sulfur environment of lower ligand-field strength leads to reduction of diazene. Therefore diazene is likely to be involved in a reduction pathway of dinitrogen bound symmetrically (i.e., with both nitrogen atoms) to the iron\xe2\x88\x92molybdenum cofactor (FeMoCo) of the enzyme nitrogenase.

"Resonance Raman and IR spectroscopic measurements of the two diazene-bridged systems [{Fe\xe2\x80\x98NHS4\'}2(N2H2)] (\xe2\x80\x98NHS4\'2- = 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bis(2-mercaptophenylthio)diethylamine(2\xe2\x88\x92)) (I) and [{Fe\xe2\x80\x98S4\'(PPr3)}2(N2H2)] (\xe2\x80\x98S4\'2- = 1,2-bis(2-mercaptophenylthio)ethane(2\xe2\x88\x92)) (II) including 2H- and 15N-isotopomers are combined with a normal coordinate analysis (NCA) in order to describe the vibrational properties of diazene coordinated to Fe(II)\xe2\x88\x92sulfur centers. Eight of the 12 normal modes of the Fe-N2H2-Fe unit have been identified by their isotope shifts. Most of the Raman-active diazene vibrations are resonance enhanced with respect to the 600 nm transition providing further support to the assignment of this band as Fe(d) to diazene(\xcf\x80*) charge-transfer (MLCT) transition. The force constant for the N\xe2\x88\x92N bond of 7.7 mdyn/\xc3\x85 corresponds to a N\xe2\x88\x92N bond order of about 1.5 and indicates that the diazene unit is moderately activated. The force constant of the Fe\xe2\x88\x92N bond of 1.8 mdyn/\xc3\x85 is about 2.5 times as large as for a simple \xcf\x83-bond. These values confirm the \xcf\x83-donor \xcf\x80-acceptor formulation of the Fe\xe2\x88\x92diazene bond presented in part 1 of this paper. The splitting of the diazene N\xe2\x88\x92H and N\xe2\x88\x92D vibrations observed in the Raman spectra of II is ascribed to a photoisomerization process taking place upon irradiation into the MLCT band.

"A series of phenoxyl radical complexes of zinc(II) have been generated in solution and, in one instance, isolated as solid material (5) in order to study their spectroscopic features by EPR, resonance Raman, and UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectroscopy. They serve as model complexes for the active form of the copper containing fungal enzyme galactose oxidase. The complexes [Zn(L1H2)]BF4\xc2\xb7H2O (1), [Zn(L2H2)]BF4\xc2\xb7H2O (2), [Zn(L2H)] (2a), [Zn(L3)(Ph2acac)] (3), [Zn(L4)(Ph2acac)] (4), and [Zn(L4)(Me-acac)] (6) were synthesized from solutions of Zn(BF4)2\xc2\xb74H2O and the corresponding ligand (L1H3 = 1,4,7-tris(3,5-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane; L2H3 = 1,4,7-tris(3-tert-butyl-5-methoxy-2-hydroxybenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane; L3H = 1,4-dimethyl-7-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane; L4H = 1,4-dimethyl-7-(3-tert-butyl-5-methoxy-2-hydroxybenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, Ph2acac- = 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedionate, and Me-acac- = 3-methyl-2,4-pentanedionate). Complexes 2, 3\xc2\xb70.5 toluene\xc2\xb71n-hexane, and 4 were structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. An electrochemical investigation of these complexes in CH3CN and/or CH2Cl2 solution revealed that the coordinated phenolate ligands undergo reversible one-electron oxidations with formation of coordinated phenoxyl radicals. Synthetically, the microcrystalline, paramagnetic (\xce\xbceff = 1.7 \xce\xbcB), solid material of [Zn(L4)(Ph2acac)]PF6 (5) was produced by one electron oxidation of 4 by 1 equiv of ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate in dry CH2Cl2. Oxidation of coordinated phenol pendent arms in 1, 2, and 2a occurs at significantly higher potentials and is irreversible. Electronic (UV\xe2\x88\x92vis), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and resonance Raman (RR) spectra of the radicals have been studied in solution and allow the description of the electronic structure of these coordinated phenoxyl radical complexes.

"A novel series of vanadium(V) hydroxylamido complexes with weak ligands including glycine, [VO(NH2O)2(Glycine)]\xc2\xb7H2O (1); serine, [VO(NH2O)2(Serine)]\xc2\xb7H2O (2); glycylglycine, [VO(NH2O)2(GlyGly)]\xc2\xb7H2O (3); and imidazole, [VO(NH2O)2(imidazole)2]Cl (4) were prepared and characterized both in solution and in the solid state. All complexes were prepared in aqueous solution at neutral pH at ambient temperature and as crystalline solids. The vanadium atom in these four complexes is seven-coordinate with pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. In complexes 1\xe2\x88\x923 the hydroxylamido groups are coordinated side-on with the hydroxylamido nitrogen cis to the organic ligand in the equatorial plane. In complex 4, the hydroxylamido groups are coordinated side-on with the hydroxylamido nitrogen trans to the imidazole ligand in the equatorial plane. The UV/vis spectra of these complexes were also examined, and the absorbance peaks show similarities between the properties of the vanadium(V) hydroxylamido complexes and known side-on peroxovanadium complexes. Multinuclear NMR studies were conducted to characterize the solution structure and properties of compounds 1\xe2\x88\x924. A particularly detailed study of compound 4 was carried out since the analogous vanadium(V) peroxo complex could also be prepared. Complex 4 was less labile and more stable than the corresponding diperoxovanadium(V)\xe2\x88\x92imidazole complex, H[VO(O2)2(imidazole)] (5). In solution the inherent asymmetry of the hydroxylamido ligand has facilitated an in-depth study of ligand exchange. Upon dissolution, compound 4 forms three isomeric complexes, all of which have one of the original two-coordinated imidazole groups in the complex dissociated. 1D and 2D EXSY and multinuclear NMR spectroscopies were used to examine the stoichiometry of the isomers, their structures, and the dynamics of their ligand exchanges. Specifically, both inter- and intramolecular exchanges were observed for the dihydroxylamine\xe2\x88\x92vanadium(V)\xe2\x88\x92imidazole involving both the coordinated imidazole and the coordinated hydroxylamido groups. The intramolecular exchange of the coordinated imidazole in 5 was compared to the exchange in the hydroxylamido complex, and the hydroxylamido compounds were found to have some properties that may be advantageous over those of the diperoxovanadium(V) complexes. In summary, evidence was generated to support the existence of a novel and unprecedented asymmetric hydroxylamido\xe2\x88\x92metal complex as well as the first isolation and characterization of a vanadium(V)\xe2\x88\x92imidazole complex not enjoying stabilization by other organic ligands.

"We have characterized thiol-derivatized, single-stranded DNA (5\xe2\x80\x98-HS-(CH2)6-CAC GAC GTT GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA G-3\xe2\x80\x98, abbreviated HS-ssDNA) attached to gold via a sulfur\xe2\x88\x92gold linkage using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ellipsometry, and 32P-radiolabeling experiments. We found that hybridization of surface-bound HS-ssDNA is dependent on surface coverage. The buffer concentration of the HS-ssDNA solution was found to have a profound effect on surface coverage, with adsorption greatly reduced at low salt concentration. More precise control over surface coverage was achieved by creating mixed monolayers of the thiol-derivatized probe and a spacer thiol, mercaptohexanol (MCH), by way of a two-step method, where first the gold substrate is exposed to a micromolar solution of HS-ssDNA, followed by exposure to a millimolar solution of MCH. A primary advantage of using this two-step process to form HS-ssDNA/MCH mixed monolayers is that nonspecifically adsorbed DNA is largely removed from the surface. Thus, the majority of surface-bound probes are accessible for specific hybridization with complementary oligonucleotides and are able to discriminate between complementary and noncomplementary target molecules. Moreover, the probe-modified surfaces were found to be stable, and hybridization reactions were found to be completely reversible and specific in a series of experiments where duplex melting was examined.

"Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble have been carried out to calculate (i) the boiling point diagram for the binary mixture of n-octane and n-dodecane at a pressure of 20 kPa, (ii) the 366 K isotherm for the binary mixture of supercritical ethane and n-heptane, and (iii) the free energies of transfer from a helium vapor phase at a pressure of 1 atm to an n-heptane liquid phase for the solutes n-pentane and n-hexane. Results are reported for three force fields (OPLS, SKS, and TraPPE) which all employ the united-atom description and Lennard\xe2\x88\x92Jones nonbonded bead\xe2\x88\x92bead interactions. The simulation methodology in conjunction with the TraPPE force field produces results in excellent agreement with experimental data. The simulated boiling points at 20 kPa are 342.7 \xc2\xb1 1.6 K (n-octane) and 423.8 \xc2\xb1 1.3 K (n-dodecane) compared to the experimental values of 349.1 and 431.3 K, respectively. For the ethane/n-heptane mixture the pressure dependence of the composition is very well reproduced. Free energies are calculated directly from the partitioning between the coexisting vapor and liquid phases without the need of multistep thermodynamic integration. The calculated free energies of transfer are \xe2\x88\x9213.3 \xc2\xb1 0.3 kJ mol-1 (n-pentane) and \xe2\x88\x9216.2 \xc2\xb1 0.5 kJ mol-1 (n-hexane), in good agreement with the experimental values of \xe2\x88\x9213.7 \xc2\xb1 0.1 and \xe2\x88\x9216.6 \xc2\xb1 0.1 kJ mol-1. Our simulation methodology and the TraPPE force field have no pressure- or density-dependent parameters and can be utilized to perform calculations for a wide range of physical conditions which are outside the range of validity of most semiempirical solvation models and for which experiments are sometimes difficult to perform, such as phase equilibria at high temperatures and pressures.

"A previous experimental study of the \xce\xb1C\xe2\x88\x92H bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of amines indicated a significant decrease in BDE (or increase in radical stabilization energy, Es) in the series primary, secondary, and tertiary. However, this was not supported by theoretical investigations. The \xce\xb1C\xe2\x88\x92H BDEs of trimethylamine ((CH3)3NH), triethylamine ((C2H5)3NH), and tri-n-butylamine ((C4H9)3NH) and of the cyclic secondary amines piperidine, piperazine, morpholine, and pyrrolidine were therefore determined by photoacoustic calorimetry in benzene solvent. Ab initio procedures, which incorporated isodesmic reactions to minimize residual correlation errors, were used to obtain the BDEs of several of these for direct comparisons. Also the BDEs of methylamine (CH3NH2), ethylamine (C2H5NH2), isopropylamine ((CH3)2CHNH2)), and dimethylamine ((CH3)2NH) were calculated as a check on the earlier results. The experimental BDEs in kJ mol-1 at 298 K (\xc2\xb110 kJ mol-1), estimated from the photoacoustic calorimetric measurements, were as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 trimethylamine 372, triethylamine 381, tri-n-butylamine 381, piperidine 385, piperazine 385, morpholine 389, and pyrrolidine 377. The ab initio results were in excellent agreement with these values. From earlier work and the present calculations the \xce\xb1-to-N C\xe2\x88\x92H BDE of methylamine was estimated to be 388 \xc2\xb1 <10 kJ mol-1, corresponding to a radical stabilization energy, Es, of \xe2\x88\xbc51 kJ mol-1. Contrary to the previous experimental finding, both theory and experiment showed that the increase in Es on alkylation either at N or C is expected to be less than 4 kJ mol-1. Values of for the \xce\xb1-C radicals of the smaller aliphatic amines, except that of methylamine, must therefore be revised. The three-electron two-orbital \xcf\x80-like interaction, which causes the \xce\xb1C radical stabilization, is maximized when the singly occupied spn orbital of C and the nonbonded doubly occupied spn orbital of N are anticoplanar to each other. Alkylamines preferably adopt a conformation in which at least one \xce\xb1C\xe2\x88\x92H bond is anticoplanar to the lone pair on nitrogen, and the most stable carbon centered \xce\xb1-to-N free radical is that derived by abstraction of this H atom. In the five-membered pyrrolidine ring the radical adopts an envelope conformation with the C5 carbon atom at the vertex. This accommodates the favorable alignment of the spn orbitals of C\xe2\x80\xa2 and N but has no C\xe2\x88\x92H eclipsing interactions like those which occur in the parent. Thus, in effect, there is a reduction of strain on formation of the radical, and the BDE is lowered by \xe2\x88\xbc8 kJ mol-1 below that of typical secondary amines. "
"The effect of ring-oxygen protonation on the structure and conformational properties of a model deoxyaldofuranose, 2-deoxy-\xce\xb2-d-glycero-tetrofuranose 2, has been examined with the use of NMR spectroscopy and ab initio molecular orbital calculations conducted at the HF/6-31G* level of theory. The computational method was validated by comparing the conformational behavior of 2 derived from PSEUROT treatment of 3JHH values measured in 2 (2H2O solvent) with that predicted from the theoretical calculations. Coupling data indicate that 2 favors S forms in solution (\xe2\x88\xbc89% 4T3, \xe2\x88\xbc11% E2), while MO data indicated more comparable populations of the same or very similar N and S forms. Protonation of 2 at the ring oxygen (O4), yielding 1, gave two distinct protonated forms which differed in the orientation of the proton about O4. Both forms showed substantial changes in ring structure and conformation compared to 2. Protonated forms almost exclusively prefer S forms (E3), and energy barriers for N/S interconversion were found to be considerably higher than those for 2, leading to the conclusion that 1 is more conformationally constrained than 2. Bond lengths in the vicinity of O4 changed significantly upon conversion of 2 to 1; for example, the C1\xe2\x88\x92O4 bond length increases by \xe2\x88\xbc14%, the C1\xe2\x88\x92H1 and C1\xe2\x88\x92O1 bond lengths decrease by 1\xe2\x88\x925%, and the C4\xe2\x88\x92O4 bond length increases by \xe2\x88\xbc5%. These results indicate that O4 protonation predisposes 2 toward ring opening by inducing specific structural and conformational modifications, thus providing a more concise explanation of the role of acid catalysis in furanose anomerization (i.e., 1 resembles the transition state of the acid-catalyzed anomerization reaction more than 2). The molecular orbital data obtained in this investigation also provide evidence for a new structural factor (a 1,3-effect involving oxygen lone-pair orbitals) that influences bond lengths in carbohydrates.

"Methyl \xce\xb2-d-ribofuranoside 5 and methyl 2-deoxy-\xce\xb2-d-erythro-pentofuranoside (methyl 2-deoxy-\xce\xb2-d-ribofuranoside) 6 were synthesized with single sites of 13C-enrichment at each carbon, and a complete set of 13C\xe2\x88\x921H and 13C\xe2\x88\x9213C spin-coupling constants (37 couplings in 5, 41 couplings in 6) in these molecules were obtained by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. 2JCH coupling signs were determined from the observation of relative cross-peak displacements in 2D TOCSY data. The 13C\xe2\x88\x921H couplings (one-, two-, and three-bond) were interpreted in structural and conformational terms with assistance from conformational models of 5 and 6 based on conventional two-state pseudorotational analysis of 3JHH values (PSEUROT) and on theoretical predictions of conformational energies and JCH values obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations on the ten envelope and planar conformers of \xce\xb2-d-ribofuranose 4 and 2-deoxy-\xce\xb2-d-erythro-pentofuranose (2-deoxy-\xce\xb2-d-ribofuranose) 3. A comparison of theoretical JCH values in 3 and 4 allowed an assessment of the effect of C2 structure (C2 oxy vs C2 deoxy) on coupling magnitudes and signs. Results show that the behavior of related JCH values in 5 and 6 may differ, especially when C2 is involved as a coupled nucleus. In addition, several 1JCH, 2JCH, and 3JCH values in \xce\xb2-d-ribo and 2-deoxy-\xce\xb2-d-ribo rings were found to be sensitive to furanose ring and hydroxymethyl group conformation; in the deoxyribo ring, the presence of diastereotopic protons at C2 produces paired 13C\xe2\x88\x921H coupling pathways involving H2R and H2S that are complementary, and differences in the resulting paired JCH values are, in some instances, sensitive to ring conformation. JCC values in \xce\xb2-d-ribo and 2-deoxy-\xce\xb2-d-ribo rings also reflect differences in ring structure and geometry, although fewer (e.g., 2JC3,C5, 3JC1,C5, 3JC2,C5) appear useful as conformational probes. The correlations drawn between ring structure/conformation and JCH/JCC magnitude and sign in 5 and 6 will be useful in anticipated applications of these couplings to assess furanose ring conformation/dynamics in DNA and RNA oligomers and in other biomolecules containing \xce\xb2-d-ribo and 2-deoxy-\xce\xb2-d-ribo rings.

"The nature of metal species in aqueous solution is often ambiguous since the two processes, OH- coordination and ligand deprotonation, have the same pH profile. This problem plagues the assessment of the form of some radiopharmaceuticals present at physiological pH. Representative M(V)O(N2S2) (M = 99mTc, Re) radiopharmaceuticals include ReO(ECH3) complexes (ECH3 = thrice deprotonated ethylene di(cysteine), ECH6). We found that syn-ReO(dl-ECH3) (1) (meso-ECH3, formed from dl-cysteine) and the tetramethyl analog, syn-ReO(dl-TMECH3) (2, TMECH6 = ethylene di(penicillamine)), have uniquely informative spectral properties. Two equivalents of OH- convert 1 and 2 to the dianionic form. This form of 2 has only one set of three penicillamine (pen) 1H NMR signals near pH 6. However, these signals underwent major changes from pH 6 to 10 as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 they broadened and collapsed; two equal sets of three signals emerged; these then broadened and collapsed; and the original set of three signals reemerged. Combined with the Raman data given below, these results require that one form is present from pH 6 to 10 and that this form be chiral and both conformationally and configurationally fluxional; one N is protonated and the other N bears a lone pair (Lp). The determinant of chirality of this NH/NLp form is the site of the NH group. The magnetic equivalence leading to one set of pen signals observed at the low and high ends of the pH range demonstrates the occurrence of fast exchange of the NH site between the two N\'s. This exchange leads to rapid inversion of complex chirality through symmetric intermediates, an NH/NH monoanion and an NLp/NLp trianion, in the acid- and base-catalyzed processes, respectively. At neutral pH, the H+ and OH- concentrations are low; as a result, the inversion of chirality is slow compared to the NMR time scale, and the two halves of the ligand are magnetically inequivalent. The two ReO bands found in a fixed ratio in the resonance Raman spectra of 2 between pH 6 and 10 indicate that two major NH/NLp conformers are present throughout the range, including physiological pH. Two conformers of a form axially ligated by OH- cannot explain the two equal sets of pen NMR signals. However, two NH/NLp conformers differing only in NLp orientation and in rapid interchange via NLp inversion explain all the spectral results. Thus, the use of fast and slow time scale spectroscopies eliminates the ligation/deprotonation ambiguity in this case. "
"We present the theory of site-directed dichroism and its application to the determination of rotational and orientational constraints for oriented polypeptides such as transmembrane helices. Infrared spectroscopy dichroism measurements of single amide I vibrational modes corresponding to 13C-labeled sites within the polypeptide contain information about the helix tilt and rotation angles. This information is readily extracted by analysis of the dichroism of a set of sites along the peptide sequence. Data for just two consecutive sites in the dimeric transmembrane domain of glycophorin A yield the tilt of the helix axis with respect the membrane normal and the rotation of the helix about its axis. By using dichroism data from three consecutive sites, the helix orientation parameters and the orientation of the amide I transition dipole moment, \xce\xb1, can be obtained; the parameters are in close agreement with the solution NMR structure of the glycophorin A peptide dimer and literature values for \xce\xb1. The approach provides orientational information about selectively labeled peptides even under conditions of modest fractional sample order. "
"The carbon-13 chemical shift tensors of pentaerythritol (C(CH2OH)4, tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)methane) are measured with use of the two-dimensional chemical shift correlation technique. The results are interpreted with quantum-chemical ab initio gauge invariant atomic orbital computations of the nuclear shielding tensors based on X-ray and neutron diffraction structures, and on corresponding structures modified by optimizing the CH2 proton positions with the Gaussian 94 program. The X-ray based computations correlate with the experimental tensors with a root-mean-square deviation of 4.45 ppm, while the neutron structure gives a root-mean-square deviation of 0.86 ppm. After optimizing the CH2 proton positions for the X-ray and neutron structures, root-mean-square deviations of 1.19 and 0.84 ppm, respectively, are calculated. Tensor computations for the central carbon were done with hypothetical structures obtained by altering the C\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92C angle. The difference between the two computed principal values of this axially symmetric tensor varies at a rate of 2.7 ppm/deg as the angle changes. The experimentally measured chemical shift difference of 14.6 ppm corresponds to a C\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92C bond angle of 106.6\xc2\xb0, in good agreement with the X-ray diffraction value of 107.3\xc2\xb0 and the neutron diffraction value of 107.1\xc2\xb0.

"An experiment is presented that allows the quantitative measurement of the cross-correlation rate between 1HN CSA and 1HN\xe2\x88\x9215N dipolar interaction in uniformly 15N-enriched samples. The CSA/DD cross-correlation rate is obtained from the intensity ratio of an experiment in which the CSA/DD cross-correlation is active for a fixed time, \xcf\x84, with a reference experiment in which it is inactive. The CSA/DD cross-correlation rates of 75 residues of the HU protein from Bacillus stearothermophilus were obtained from the linear fits of CSA/DD to reference ratios recorded for five values of \xcf\x84 and at two different Bo fields. After correction for the mobility of the 1H\xe2\x88\x9215N bond vector the values of (\xcf\x83\xe2\x88\xa5 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x83\xe2\x8a\xa5)(3 cos2(\xce\xb8) \xe2\x88\x92 1)/2, containing information about the chemical shielding anisotropy, were derived for individual amide protons. The average value of 13 \xc2\xb1 5 ppm compares well with the results from previous solid state NMR measurements. The data also show a dependence upon hydrogen bonding and secondary structure:\xe2\x80\x89 residues in \xce\xb1-helical conformation show values of 9 \xc2\xb1 4 ppm, whereas residues in \xce\xb2-sheet conformation show substantially higher values of 16 \xc2\xb1 6 ppm.

"A systematic study of the binding of carbohydrates by functionalized zinc porphyrins indicated that [5, 15-bis(8-quinolyl)porphyrinato]zinc(II) (1) showed marked affinity for octyl glucoside and mannoside in CHCl3 (\xe2\x88\x92\xce\x94G\xc2\xb0 = 4.5\xe2\x88\x926.3 kcal mol-1). Analysis of the complexation-induced shifts of the carbohydrate OH protons in the 1H NMR revealed that receptor 1 bound the 4-OH group of mannoside and glucoside by coordination to the zinc and the 6-OH and 3-OH groups by hydrogen bonding to the quinolyl nitrogen atoms. These NMR results and comparison of binding affinity with reference receptors and ligands indicated that receptor 1 recognized the trans,trans-1,2-dihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl) moiety of carbohydrates by the combination of Lewis acid (zinc) and Lewis bases (quinolyl nitrogens). Poor affinities of 1 to octyl galactosides and octyl 2-O-methyl-\xce\xb1-mannoside were ascribed to neighboring group effects, where a neighboring group in ligands not directly involved in the receptor\xe2\x88\x92ligand interactions had considerable influence on the affinity through destabilizing the hydrogen-bonding-network(s) in the receptor\xe2\x88\x92ligand complex. The circular dichroism induced in the porphyrin Soret band by complexation with the carbohydrates displayed characteristic patterns, which parallel the patterns of the complexation-induced shifts in the 1H NMR. The CD patterns sensitively reflected the receptor\xe2\x88\x92ligand interaction modes, particularly ligand orientation and fluctuation in the complex. Variable-temperature CD revealed that glucoside was fluctuating on 1 while mannoside was rigidly fixed on 1 at room temperature. Addition of alcohols to CHCl3 suppressed the binding by 1, while addition of polar additives such as water, alcohols, phenols, and ethers assisted the binding by 3 and 4 (\xe2\x88\x92\xce\x94\xce\x94G\xc2\xb0 = 0.2\xe2\x88\x920.4 kcal mol-1) in a low concentration range (0\xe2\x88\x921.5 mol %).

"Fourier transform reflection\xe2\x88\x92absorption infrared spectroscopy (FT-RAIRS) was used to study the chemistry of cyanogen (C2N2) and hydrogen on Pt(111). The partial dissociative adsorption of cyanogen at 300 K results in the formation of the well-known molecularly adsorbed \xce\xb1 state and dissociatively adsorbed \xce\xb21 and \xce\xb22 states. The \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb22 states were found to undergo hydrogenation at this temperature, forming the respective iminium (CNH2) containing species diaminoethylene ((CNH2)2) and aminomethylidyne (CNH2), while the \xce\xb21 state is shown to be inert toward hydrogenation. Isotopic substitution experiments utilizing 13C and 15N show diaminoethylene to be the hydrogenation product of C2N2 that forms on Pt(111), while incremental 2H exchange reactions confirm that (CNH2)2 possesses a high degree of symmetry and a likely \xce\xbc2\xce\xb72-bridge bound configuration. Diaminoethylene undergoes partial decomposition at \xe2\x88\xbc377 K, forming a mixture of CNH2 dimers, CNH2 monomers, and possibly HNC. These secondary decomposition products undergo subsequent decomposition between 425 and 450 K, forming HCN(g) and CNads. "
"The interaction between a spherical metal ion M+ and a rare gas atom Rg is analyzed in terms of the long-range effects of polarization and dispersion. The inclusion of higher-order linear polarization effects is found to enhance significantly the polarization contribution to binding compared to a simple charge-induced dipole interaction. The discrepancy between experimental or ab initio binding energies and the long-range energy of polarization and dispersion is found to be much reduced when higher-order effects are included, indicating a negligible role for covalency in these ions.

Statistical entropies have been determined by using ab initio molecular parameters and several previously defined models (E1, E2, and E3). The accuracy of the ab initio proton-transfer entropies (\xce\x94S) obtained with the E3 procedure (1 J mol-1 K-1) is significantly better than that normally attainable for \xce\x94S values derived from van\'t Hoff plots of experimental equilibrium data for proton-transfer reactions (5\xe2\x88\x9210 J mol-1 K-1). In fact, even the simplest E1 procedure produces proton-transfer entropies that are accurate to about 1\xe2\x88\x922 J mol-1 K-1. The commonly used isoelectronic approach to estimating entropies of gas-phase ions has been tested. Errors associated with this approximation are generally about 1\xe2\x88\x923 J mol-1 K-1, but can increase to 5\xe2\x88\x9210 J mol-1 K-1 for systems that have low energy torsional or other floppy modes. G2 enthalpies and E3 entropies have been used to obtain free energies (\xce\x94G) for 25 experimentally observed proton-transfer reactions. The ab initio free energies are in very good agreement with experimental values, the mean absolute deviation being 2.2 kJ mol-1 and maximum deviation 4.9 kJ mol-1. There is also very good agreement between theory and experiment for the enthalpies of these proton-transfer reactions with a mean absolute deviation and maximum deviation of 2.7 and 8.5 kJ mol-1, respectively. Theoretical proton affinity (\xce\x94H) and gas-phase basicity (\xce\x94G) scales have been constructed on the basis of G2 energies for 39 molecules and corresponding protonated species. There is generally good agreement between theory and experiment. The small deviations that do exist between theoretical and experimental values appear to correlate with the proton affinity magnitude.

"The cycloheptatrienyl actinide sandwich compounds An(\xce\xb77-C7H7)2q (An = Th\xe2\x88\x92Am; q = 2\xe2\x88\x92, 1\xe2\x88\x92, 0, 1+) have been studied by using local and gradient-corrected density functional methods, with the inclusion of scalar (mass\xe2\x88\x92velocity and Darwin) relativistic effects. It has been found that the staggered conformer of U(\xce\xb77-C7H7)2- is more stable than the eclipsed one by about 0.6 kcal/mol. The f\xce\xb4 orbitals not only participate in the bonding with the e2\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 p\xcf\x80 orbitals of the C7H7 rings, but are as important as the d\xce\xb4 orbitals in stabilizing the frontier p\xcf\x80 orbitals of the C7H7 rings. With increasing atomic number of the actinide, the 5f manifold and ligand based frontier MOs become considerably closer in energy. As a result, the actinide 5f percentage in the frontier e2\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 MOs increases markedly, while the contribution by the 6d orbitals gradually decreases. The ground electron configurations, ionization energies, electron affinities, and An\xe2\x88\x92C7H7 bond energies are strongly affected by these effects. The bonding analysis indicates that U(\xce\xb77-C7H7)2- and U(\xce\xb77-C7H7)2 are best considered as complexes of U(III) and U(IV), respectively. "
" Ab initio calculations were carried out for the hydrogen abstraction reaction from fluoromethane by chlorine atom. Optimized geometries and frequencies were computed at the MP2/6-31+G(d) level of theory for reactants, products, and transition state, as well as 15 points along the minimum energy path (MEP). Energies were obtained by a single-point calculation at the QCISD(T)/6-311G(d,p) and MP2/6-311+G(3df,2p) levels of theory to produce the potential energy information at the G2(MP2) level of theory. The vibrational adiabatic potential curve was found to have two barriers due to large variational effects in this system. The rate constants were calculated for the temperature range 200\xe2\x88\x92700 K by using variational transition state theory (VTST) with simple tunneling corrections. While a general agreement was found with experimental values when using improved canonical VTST for most of the temperature range, the calculated Arrhenius slope was too steep in comparison to experiment for lower temperatures.

"The dimethylcarbene radical cation, (CH3)2C\xe2\x80\xa2+, has been generated in the gas phase. Experimental identification was achieved by charge stripping mass spectrometry whereby the stable dimethylcarbene dication, (CH3)2C2+, is observed. Electron impact appearance energy measurements and G2 ab initio molecular orbital calculations have been used to investigate the thermochemistry of the dimethylcarbene radical cation. The carbene radical cation is calculated to lie 84 kJ mol-1 above the propene radical cation and to be separated from it by a barrier of 35 kJ mol-1. "
"A new high-temperature gas-phase electron diffraction analysis of manganese trifluoride, combined with high-level quantum chemical calculations, provides direct geometrical evidence of a Jahn\xe2\x88\x92Teller distortion in a free molecule. The potential energy surface of the molecule was scanned extensively by computation at the SCF level. CASSCF and CASPT2 calculations established that of the many C2v symmetry stationary points on the potential energy surface the lowest energy ones are quintets. The global minimum is a quintet state of 5A1 symmetry. In this planar C2v symmetry structure there are two longer and one somewhat shorter Mn\xe2\x88\x92F bonds, with two bond angles close to 106\xc2\xb0 and one bond angle of about 148\xc2\xb0. The second lowest energy state was of 5B2 symmetry, which turned out to be a transition state with an imaginary b2 (in plane) bending frequency. A constrained planar structure of D3h molecular symmetry has appreciably higher energy than the 5B2 symmetry structure. The experimental data are in complete agreement with the results of the computations in giving the best agreement with a C2v structure characterized by rg(Mn\xe2\x88\x92F) = 1.728 \xc2\xb1 0.014 \xc3\x85 (once), rg(Mn\xe2\x88\x92F) = 1.754 \xc2\xb1 0.008 \xc3\x85 (twice), \xe2\x88\xa0\xce\xb1(F\xe2\x88\x92Mn\xe2\x88\x92F) = 106.4 \xc2\xb1 0.9\xc2\xb0 (twice), and \xe2\x88\xa0\xce\xb1(F\xe2\x88\x92Mn\xe2\x88\x92F) = 143.3 \xc2\xb1 2.0\xc2\xb0 (once). Our computed infrared wavenumbers and intensities make an assignment possible for published vibrational spectra of MnF3. "
"Insertion of achiral \xcf\x89-amino acids into peptide sequences results in replacement of scissile peptide bonds by proteolytically stable C\xe2\x88\x92C bonds. This provides a convenient means of creating peptidomimetics. The present study establishes the preservation of helical structures in octa- and undecapeptides with centrally located \xce\xb2- and \xce\xb3-amino acids in the sequence. X-ray diffraction analyses of single crystals and NMR studies have been used to investigate the extent of perturbations of a regular 310- or \xce\xb1-helix by the introduction of (\xe2\x88\x92CH2\xe2\x88\x92)n groups into the backbone by the use of the \xce\xb2-Ala-\xce\xb3-Abu segment (\xce\xb2-Ala = \xce\xb2-alanine, \xce\xb3-Abu = \xce\xb3-aminobutyric acid), which is formally homomorphous with a (Gly)3 segment. In crystals, the octapeptide Boc-Leu-Aib-Val-\xce\xb2-Ala-\xce\xb3-Abu-Leu-Aib-Val-OMe (1) and the undecapeptide Boc-Leu-Aib-Val-\xce\xb2-Ala-\xce\xb3-Abu-Leu-Aib-Val-Ala-Leu-Aib-OMe (2) retain their helical motifs with minor bulges. Five new types of 4 \xe2\x86\x92 1, 5 \xe2\x86\x92 1, and 6 \xe2\x86\x92 1 hydrogen bond rings are formed with up to three extra CH2 moieties. Cell parameters for peptide 1 are space group P212121 with a = 11.506 (1) \xc3\x85, b = 16.600 (1) \xc3\x85, c = 27.362(1) \xc3\x85, and R = 6.1% for 2696 data measured >4\xcf\x83(F); for the undecapeptide 2, the space group is P21 with a = 8.605 (3) \xc3\x85, b = 22.806 (4) \xc3\x85, c = 19.014 (3) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 101.47(2)\xc2\xb0, and R = 7.5% for 3797 data measured >4\xcf\x83(F). Helical conformations in solution are also maintained for peptide 2 as is evident from NMR studies in CDCl3, which suggest that the centrally positioned, flexible \xce\xb2-Ala-\xce\xb3-Abu segment can be comfortably accommodated into helical structures adopting gauche conformations about specific C\xe2\x88\x92C bonds of the poly(methylene) units. Twenty structures for backbone conformations generated from MD simulations using NMR-derived contraints, superpose with a low RMSD value (0.78 \xc2\xb1 0.05 \xc3\x85), further indicating that in these peptides the conformational flexibility of the \xce\xb2-Ala-\xce\xb3-Abu segment is limited and confined to largely helical conformations.

"The structure\xe2\x88\x92function relationship of cytochrome c (Cyt-c) interacted with the lipid bilayer membranes was studied by various spectroscopic methods, the reaction\xe2\x88\x92products analysis, and its kinetics. Ultrafiltration binding assay, UV\xe2\x88\x92visible, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies showed that Cyt-c was tightly bound to the lipid bilayer membranes bearing a phosphate head group. The anisotropic and nonnatural complexation with the phosphate\xe2\x88\x92lipid membranes caused a spin-state change of the heme in the active center of Cyt-c. Depending on the membrane fluidity, two classes of the structurally altered Cyt-c were prepared and they showed the greatly enhanced N-demethylase activity. Products analysis by HPLC demonstrated that the lipid membrane bound Cyt-c performs a clean enzymatic reaction similar to native hemoenzymes. Kinetics studies established that there are two different activation manners via the phosphate lipid bilayer membranes:\xe2\x80\x89 namely, simple enhancement of the affinity for H2O2, or the increased catalytic efficiency (kcat) in addition to the enhanced affinity for H2O2. The membrane fluidity again significantly affected the N-demethylation kinetics. A potential of the lipid membrane assembly to functionalize native proteins and enzymes with noncovalent but specific interactions is also discussed. "
"Ab initio gas phase calculations at the RHF/6-31+G(d) level have been used to define the geometries of the transition states for the intramolecular displacement reactions with monophenyl esters of glutaric (I), succinic (II), and 3,6-endoxo-\xce\x944-tetrahydrophthalic (III) acids to provide the corresponding anhydrides plus phenolate. As determined experimentally, the rate determining step was found to involve transition states in which phenoxide is departing. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations from transition state toward reactant and product sides provided intramolecular ion\xe2\x88\x92molecule complexes (IIMC) of I and II and the tetrahedral intermediate of III and the product ion\xe2\x88\x92molecule complexes (IMC) of the phenoxide and anhydride of I, II, and III. Vibrational frequency calculations were performed for all stationary states. Single point calculations using an electron correlation method and different solvation methods were performed on optimized reactant side gas phase geometries. The transition states formed from I, II, and III are essentially identical in bond lengths (ester carbon to leaving phenoxide 1.77, 1.79, or 1.80 \xc3\x85; carbonyl oxygen to ester carbon 1.20 or 1.21 \xc3\x85; nucleophilic oxygen to ester carbon 1.44 or 1.43 \xc3\x85; and \xce\xb1-carbon to ester carbon 1.52 or 1.53 \xc3\x85) and angles (characterized by the attacking oxygen, ester carbon, and leaving oxygen 97.8\xc2\xb0, 97.3\xc2\xb0, 96.7\xc2\xb0; attacking oxygen, ester carbon, and ester carbonyl oxygen 117.0\xc2\xb0, 117.4\xc2\xb0, 113.7\xc2\xb0). Transition state stabilization as a result of restricting low frequency vibrations is determined by comparing the frequencies of the IIMC (and tetrahedral intermediate) to the corresponding TS. The total number of frequencies does not change in going from the IIMC (or TI) to the TS for each ester. For those frequencies lower than 1000 cm-1, the number of frequencies remains constant. On comparing the ratio between the number of frequencies below 1000 cm-1 and the total number of frequencies in the transition states formed from I, II, and III, we find 0.49, 0.51, and 0.55, respectively. By the criteria of superimposable TS structures and lack of evidence for frequency changes in the TS in the direction of increasing rate, we conclude that the rate ratios of \xe2\x88\xbc230-fold in comparing I/II and II/III reside in ground state phenomena. This conclusion is supported by the geometries of IIMC and TS structures. Gas phase reaction coordinates and derived enthalpy and entropy values are provided and discussed. Conversion of ground state intramolecular anion ester complexes (IIMC) of esters I and II to their respective TSs involves a decrease in computed \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 while \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 remains invariant. In a previous investigation, the formation of ground state conformations (NACs) of geometry that allows entrance to the IIMC and then TS was found to be related to \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 rather than \xce\x94S\xc2\xb0. The importance of these findings to a general concept of entropy driven kinetic processes is discussed. "
"NAD+-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is assembled onto a pyrroloquinoline quinone-NAD+ monolayer. The redox active monolayer is assembled via covalent attachment of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) to a cystamine monolayer associated with a Au electrode, followed by covalent linkage of N6-(2-aminoethyl)-NAD+ to the monolayer. The surface coverage of PQQ and NAD+ units is ca. 1.2 \xc3\x97 10-10 mol cm-2. The surface coverage of LDH bound to the redox active monolayer is ca. 3.5 \xc3\x97 10-12 mol cm-2. The assembled LDH monolayer is active in the bioelectrocatalytic oxidation of lactate. The bioelectrocatalyzed process involves the PQQ-mediated oxidation of the immobilized NADH in the presence of Ca2+ ions. The LDH associated with the PQQ-NAD+ monolayer assembled on the electrode surface exhibits moderate stability, and the biocatalyst dissociates to the electrolyte solution. Dissociation of LDH is enhanced in the presence of solubilized NAD+. Cross-linking of the monolayer-bound LDH with glutaric dialdehyde yields an integrated stable enzyme electrode for the bioelectrocatalyzed oxidation of lactate. The electrode acts as an amperometric biosensor for lactate. Affinity binding of NAD+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase to the PQQ-NAD+-monolayer-modified Au electrode, followed by cross-linking of the enzyme, yields an enzyme electrode for the bioelectrochemical detection of ethanol.

"Myristic acid crystallizes as 1:1 mixture with its sodium salt (acid soap) at pH 9.8, as pure sodium salt (soap) upon addition of sodium chloride and gives long fibers (curds) of a carboxylate monohydrate at pH 11.5. Transmission electron microscopy shows micellar fibers as structural units of the curds. Curvature of the myristate bilayer is enforced by hydration, not by repulsive forces between anions. Ephedrinium and pseudoephedrinium myristate produce stable isolated fibers of bimolecular thickness in water. They dissolve magnesium octaethylporphyrin in a chiral arrangement and show strong CD effects. The aqueous solution is viscoelastic. Twisted ribbons were obtained from the cationic analogue cetyltrimethylammonium with the chiral adenosine monophosphate counterion. "
"The equilibrium acidities in DMSO for phenylhydrazine, five of its p-substituted derivatives, 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, and 1,1,2-triphenylhydrazine were measured and the BDEs of their acidic N\xe2\x88\x92H bonds were estimated by using the following equation:\xe2\x80\x89 BDE = 1.37pKHA + 23.06Eox(A-) + 73.3 kcal/mol. The \xce\xb1-N\xe2\x88\x92H bonds in the hydrazides CH3CONHNH2, PhCONHNH2, NH2NHCO2Et, and PhSO2NHNH2 were found to be 2 to 4 pKHA units more acidic than the \xce\xb1-N\xe2\x88\x92H bonds in the corresponding amides, and the BDEs were estimated to be 23\xe2\x88\x9227 kcal/mol weaker. Similarly, the BDE of a N\xe2\x88\x92H bond in hydrazine was estimated to be 26 kcal/mol weaker than that of an N\xe2\x88\x92H bond in NH3. Introduction of a RCO group into hydrazine had little or no effect on the BDE, but introduction of RCO into the \xce\xb2-position of PhCONHNH2 caused about an 8 kcal/mol increase in BDE. An increase in BDE was also observed for introduction of an RCO group into aniline. Here the carbonyl group is effectively destabilizing a nitrogen-centered radical by virtue of its strong electron-withdrawing effect. Incorporation of an open-chain carbohydrazide into a ring structure tends to strengthen the acidity of the N\xe2\x88\x92H bond and weaken its BDEs. "
"Total syntheses of the macrolides (R)-(+)-ricinelaidic acid lactone (6) and (\xe2\x88\x92)-gloeosporone (7), a fungal germination self-inhibitor, are presented, which are distinctly shorter and more efficient than any of the previous approaches to these targets reported in the literature. Both of them benefit from the remarkable ease of macrocyclization of 1,\xcf\x89-dienes by means of ring-closing olefin metathesis (RCM) using the ruthenium carbene 1a as catalyst precursor. The diene substrates are readily formed via the enantioselective addition of dialkylzinc reagents to aldehydes in the presence of catalytic amounts of Ti(OiPr)4 and bis-triflamide 18 and/or the stereoselective allylation of aldehydes developed by Keck et al. using allyltributylstannane in combination with a catalyst formed from Ti(OiPr)4 and (S)-(\xe2\x88\x92)-1,1\xe2\x80\x98-bi-2-naphthol. Comparative studies show this latter procedure to be more practical than the stoichiometric allylation reaction employing the allyltitanium\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb1,\xce\xb1,\xce\xb1\xe2\x80\x98,\xce\xb1\xe2\x80\x98-tetraaryl-1,3-dioxolane-4,5-dimethanol complex 3b. Finally, a method for the efficient ring closure of 4-pentenoic acid esters by RCM is presented that relies on the joint use of 1a and Ti(OiPr)4 as a binary catalyst system. These results not only expand the scope of RCM to previously unreactive substrates but also provide additional evidence for the important role of ligation of the evolving ruthenium carbene center to a polar relay substituent on the substrate which constitutes the necessary internal bias for the RCM-based macrocyclization process.

"Under UV irradiation (254 nm) at ambient temperature, a degassed mixture of (EtO)2POP(OEt)2 and RfI {Rf = CF3, C2F5, C4F9, C6F13, (CF3)2CF, CF2CFCF2, ClCF2CF2, BrCF2CF2, C6F5, ClCF2CFClCF2CF2, I(CF2)3, I(CF2)4, FO2S(CF2)4, FO2S(CF2)2O(CF2)2} affords the fluorinated phosphonite, [RfP(OEt)2]. Oxidation of the phosphonites, [RfP(OEt)2], with Me3COOH gave the corresponding fluorinated phosphonates, (EtO)2P(O)Rf (1\xe2\x88\x9214), in 35\xe2\x88\x9280% isolated yields. CF3CCl2I reacts with (EtO)2POP(OEt)2 at room tempearture in the absence of UV irradiation to afford [CF3CCl2P(OEt)2] which upon oxidation gave a 52% yield of CF3CCl2P(O)(OEt)2 (15). The reaction of (EtO)2POP(OEt)2 and RfI (Rf = ClCF2CF2, BrCF2CF2, C2F5) at 125 \xc2\xb0C in the presence of Me3COOCMe3 and subsequent oxidation of the resultant phosphonites afforded phosphonates (2, 7, and 8) albeit in lower yields (49\xe2\x88\x9262%) compared to those of the photochemical reaction (58\xe2\x88\x9280%). (RO)2P(O)CF2CF2I (R = Et, i-Pr) (16 and 17) was obtained (42\xe2\x88\x9248%) when a degassed mixture of (RO)3P and BrCF2CF2I was subjected to UV irradiation (254 nm) at ambient temperature via a unique photochemical transformation.

"A number of phosphatidyl choline derivatives containing trans-azobenzene units in the fatty ester backbone have been synthesized and studied in aqueous dispersions both pure and in the presence of saturated and unsaturated phospholipids. The structures of the assemblies formed have been investigated by microcalorimetry, dynamic light scattering, cryo-transmission electron microscopy, and reagent entrapment. While many of the mixed phospholipid dispersions give evidence for the formation of small unilamellar vesicles, the aqueous dispersions of pure azobenzene phospholipids (APL\'s) give evidence for several different structures, including relatively large plates in at least one case. The azobenzenes show strong evidence of \xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x9d aggregate formation both in the pure and mixed dispersions. The aggregation number has been estimated for several of the APL\'s and found to be typically 3 or a multiple thereof. On the basis of simulations and studies with similar stilbene phospholipids as well as on the strong induced circular dichroism signals observed for the aggregate, we infer a chiral \xe2\x80\x9cpinwheel\xe2\x80\x9d unit aggregate structure similar to that found for several aromatics. The azobenzenes in the aqueous dispersions have been found to photoisomerize to give cis-rich photostationary states; the cis-azobenzenes show no evidence for aggregation and no induced circular dichroism. The cis-azobenzenes can be isomerized back to the trans either by irradiation or by thermal paths. Mixed aqueous dispersions of trans-APL\'s with saturated or unsaturated phospholipids can be prepared which entrap the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein (CF) under conditions where the CF fluorescence is very low due to self-quenching. By varying the APL/host phospholipid ratio the azobenzene can be aggregate, monomer, or dimer. In cases where the azobenzene is monomer or dimer, irradiation produces complete isomerization but little \xe2\x80\x9cleakage\xe2\x80\x9d of CF from the vesicle interior. In contrast, where the azobenzene is predominantly aggregate, irradiation results in both photoisomerization and reagent release. That photoisomerization in the latter case can result in \xe2\x80\x9ccatastrophic\xe2\x80\x9d destruction of the vesicle can also be shown by cryo-transmission electron microscopy. "
"A new class of crown spirobenzopyrans were designed and synthesized. The crown spirobenzopyrans showed thermally irreversible photochromism only in the presence of alkali-metal cations accompanying cation-selective coloring efficiency. Thus, the new crown spirobenzopyrans could transmit information of two different simultaneous stimuli (ion and photon) to changes in their optical properties. The dual-mode signal transducer molecules developed here can be considered to perform \xe2\x80\x9cAND\xe2\x80\x9d gate type signal transduction based on photochromism of artificial receptors. Molecular recognition abilities and photochromic properties of the new crown spirobenzopyrans were characterized by use of NMR and FAB mass spectroscopies. "
"Ring-opening-metathesis polymerization (ROMP) was used for the modular, molecular design of stationary phases. New materials for solid-phase extraction (SPE) as well as for air and water clean-up have been prepared by ring-opening-metathesis suspension polymerization of 1,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-1,4,5,8-exo,endo-dimethanonaphthalene (I) and its copolymerization with the functional monomer endo,endo[2.2.1]bicyclohept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride (II), using the well-defined Schrock catalyst Mo(N-2,6-i-Pr2-C6H3)CHCMe2Ph(OCMe(CF3)2)2 (III). The resulting cross-linked polymers have been investigated in terms of influence of the polymerization sequence as well as of the stoichiometries I/II and II/III on swelling behavior, surface area, capacity, accessability of the functional groups, and their possible use in SPE, respectively. In order to obtain further information about the new resins, the microstructure of poly(II) was determined by NMR techniques. Investigations revealed that it represents an all cis, atactic polymer. Due to the polymerization technique employed, capacities of the different weak cation exchangers are entirely predeterminable and may be varied over many orders of magnitudes (up to 10 mequiv/g). The materials have been used successfully for solid-phase extraction of 15 different substituted anilines and lutidines from water as well as for the sampling of volatile, airborne aliphatic amines. The unambigous advances of the new SPE materials are discussed in detail. "
"This paper describes two synthetic approaches, simultaneous and stepwise exchange, to poly-hetero-\xcf\x89-functionalized monolayer-protected cluster compounds (MPC\'s), as well their spectroscopic and electrochemical characterization. Poly-hetero-\xcf\x89-functionalization of MPC\'s provides a framework within which to study intra- and intermolecular cluster chemistry and to design multistep, mutually supporting catalytic and electron donor/acceptor reactions on cluster surfaces. Factors affecting the extent of exchange (measured by NMR) include the steric bulk of the \xcf\x89-functional group as well as the chain lengths of the protecting and incoming ligands. Poly-hetero-\xcf\x89-functionalized clusters can incorporate mixed redox functions as illustrated by microelectrode voltammetry of a poly-ferrocene/anthraquinone mixed cluster. The cluster voltammetric waves lie at potentials consistent with those observed in dilute solutions of the unbound electroactive thiols, within the uncertainty of the Ag quasi-reference electrode potential. Diffusion coefficients and hydrodynamic radii suggest that the outer parts of the cluster chains may be free-draining. This research demonstrates that 3D-SAMs with mixed \xcf\x89-functionalized alkanethiolate ligands (both redox and nonredox active) can be synthesized and characterized and provides the groundwork for synthesis of \xe2\x80\x9cnanofactory\xe2\x80\x9d cluster compounds designed to exhibit mutually supporting, multistep chemical and redox catalytic reactions, and for an enhanced capacity to study functional group reactivities at organized monolayer interfaces.

"Vibrational data (IR, Raman and inelastic neutron scattering) and a supporting normal coordinate analysis for the complex trans-W(CO)3(PCy3)2(\xce\xb72-H2) (1) and its HD and D2 isotopomers are reported. The vibrational data and force constants support the well-established \xce\xb72-bonding mode for the H2 ligand and provide unambiguous assignments for all metal\xe2\x88\x92hydrogen stretching and bending frequencies. The force constant for the HH stretch, 1.3 mdyn/\xc3\x85, is less than one-fourth the value in free H2 and is similar to that for the WH stretch, indicating that weakening of the H\xe2\x88\x92H bond and formation of W\xe2\x88\x92H bonds are well along the reaction coordinate to oxidative addition. The equilibrium isotope effect (EIE) for the reversible binding of dihydrogen (H2) and dideuterium (D2) to 1 and 1-d2 has been calculated from measured vibrational frequencies for 1 and 1-d2. The calculated EIE is \xe2\x80\x9cinverse\xe2\x80\x9d (1-d2 binds D2 better than 1 binds H2), with KH/KD = 0.78 at 300 K. The EIE calculated from vibrational frequencies may be resolved into a large normal mass and moment of inertia factor (MMI = 5.77), an inverse vibrational excitation factor (EXC= 0.67), and an inverse zero-point energy factor (ZPE = 0.20), where EIE = MMI \xc3\x97 EXC \xc3\x97 ZPE. An analysis of the zero-point energy components of the EIE shows that the large decrease in the HH stretching frequency (force constant) predicts a large normal EIE but that zero-point energies from five new vibrational modes (which originate from translational and rotational degrees of freedom from hydrogen) offset the change in zero-point energy from the H2(D2) stretch. The calculated EIE is compared to experimental data obtained for the binding of H2 or D2 to Cr(CO)3(PCy3)2 over the temperature range 12\xe2\x88\x9236 \xc2\xb0C in THF solution. For the binding of H2 \xce\x94H = \xe2\x88\x926.8 \xc2\xb1 0.5 kcal mol-1 and \xce\x94S = \xe2\x88\x9224.7 \xc2\xb1 2.0 cal mol-1 deg-1; for D2 \xce\x94H = \xe2\x88\x928.6 \xc2\xb1 0.5 kcal/mol and \xce\x94S = \xe2\x88\x9230.0 \xc2\xb1 2.0 cal/(mol deg). The EIE at 22 \xc2\xb0C has a value of KH/KD = 0.65 \xc2\xb1 0.15. Comparison of the equilibrium constants for displacement of N2 by H2 or D2 in the complex W(CO)3(PCy3)2(N2) in THF yielded a value of KH/KD = 0.70 \xc2\xb1 0.15 at 22 \xc2\xb0C. "
"A bisphthalocyanine lutetium derivative substituted with benzo-15-crown-5 subunits, [(15C5)4Pc]2Lu (1), has been shown to form sandwich complexes with cations such as potassium ion, the complexes further form pillarlike aggregates. Light scattering studies have been carried out as a function of the ratio [K+]/[1] in order to determine the characteristics of the aggregates. It has been demonstrated that high molar mass aggregates (M\xcc\x84w about 106) are formed even at small [K+]/[1] ratios, they coexist with uncomplexed monomeric [(15C5)4Pc]2Lu. The transformation from the metal-free monomer to the metal ion-containing aggregate involves a highly nonlinear two-stage complexation process. The shape of the aggregate is very probably rodlike (pillar-type structure) as indicated by the angle dependence of the light scattered. "
"This report concerns the formation and the main properties of Zr\xe2\x88\x92C functionalities supported by the O4 matrix of either the monoalkylated (trianionic) or dialkylated (dianionic) forms of [p-But-calix[4]arene] (1). The synthesis of the starting materials [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2ZrCl2] (4) and [{\xce\xbc-p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)(O)3}2 Zr2Cl2] (10) has been performed via the lithiation of the corresponding protic forms, [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(OH)2] (2) and [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)(OH)3] (8), followed by reaction with ZrCl4\xc2\xb7(thf)2. Complex 4 undergoes a facile base-induced (base = Et3N, Py) demethylation, leading to the monomethoxy derivative [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)(O)3ZrCl2]-[MeNEt3]+ (5) and ionization of the Zr\xe2\x88\x92Cl bond to give [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2Zr(OTf)2] (6). The alkylation of 4 led to the corresponding dialkylaryl derivatives [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2ZrR2] (R = Me, 12; R = CH2Ph, 13; R = CH2SiMe3, 14; R = p-MeC6H4, 15]. They undergo a base-induced demethylation and dealkylation illustrated by the obtention of [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)(O)3Zr(CH2Ph)(Py)] (18), while the thermal decomposition gave a particularly interesting result in the case of 15, with the formation of the corresponding \xce\xb72-benzyne, [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2Zr(\xce\xb72-MeC6H3)] (16). Cationic alkyl derivatives of zirconium have been obtained, in the case of 13, using the monoelectronic oxidizing agent [Cp2Fe]+ or a strong Lewis acid such as [B(C6F5)3], [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2Zr(CH2Ph)]+BPh4- (19); [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2Zr(CH2Ph)(thf)]+BPh4- (20); and [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2Zr(CH2Ph)]+ [B(C6F5)3(CH2Ph)]- (21). The cationic alkyl derivatives undergo easy demethylation by pyridine to give 18. The alkylation of 10 with LiPh led to a dimeric dimetallic aryl compound, [{\xce\xbc-p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)(O)3}2Zr2Ph2] (22), where the calix[4]arene unit bridges two metal atoms and the methoxy groups are only weakly bound to the metal. The spectator methoxy group binds strongly to the metal in the monomeric \xce\xb72-iminoacyl [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)(O)3Zr(ButNCPh)] (23), formed from the migratory insertion of ButNC into the Zr\xe2\x88\x92Ph in 22. The proposed structures have been supported by X-ray analyses carried out on 4, 6, 13, 16, 22, and 23. "
"Luminescence and excited-state electron-transfer reactions of (dppe)Pt{S2C2(2-pyridine)(H)} and (dppe)Pt{S2C2(4-pyridine)(H)} (dppe = diphenyldiphosphinoethane) are enabled by protonation of the appended pyridine, thus serving as a novel means of electronic switching. The neutral complexes have low-lying d-to-d transitions that lead to rapid decay of excited states by nonradiative processes. However, upon protonation, a 1,2-enedithiolate-to-heterocycle \xcf\x80* intraligand charge-transfer transition (ILCT) becomes lower in energy than the d-to-d transition, thus giving rise to emissive 1ILCT* and 3ILCT* excited states for [(dppe)Pt{S2C2(2-pyridinium)(H)}][BF4] and [(dppe)Pt{S2C2(4-pyridinium)(H)}][BF4]. The assignment of these excited states was based on their energies and lifetimes (\xcf\x84) which range from \xcf\x84 = 3 to 4 ns for the singlet and from \xcf\x84 = 2000 to 7500 ns for the triplet, respectively. Emission quantum yields (\xcf\x86) increase with solvent polarity and range from \xcf\x86 = 0.0006 to 0.003 for the singlet and from \xcf\x86 = 0.001 to 0.03 for the triplet. The electron acceptors p-dinitrobenzene and tetracyanoquinodimethane quench the 3ILCT* with kq values of 4 \xc3\x97 109 and 9 \xc3\x97 109 M-1 s-1, respectively. The kq values are nearly identical for the 2- and 4-pyridinium complexes, reflecting the similarity in the thermodynamic driving forces for electron transfer from these complexes. The ability to employ a simple and reversible ground-state reaction (ligand protonation) to control access to reactive excited states should prove useful in numerous applications. "
"X-ray absorption (XAS), UV\xe2\x88\x92visible, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopies have been used to characterize the interaction of azide and cyanide with the Mn(III)(\xce\xbc-O)2Mn(IV) site in superoxidized Mn catalase. The addition of azide causes no significant change in the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) region and only minor changes in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, consistent with only minimal changes in Mn\xe2\x88\x92ligand geometry. In contrast, addition of either azide or cyanide causes an approximately 3-fold increase in the intensity of the visible absorption bands and a small (approximately 4%) decrease in the Mn hyperfine coupling. Anion-binding titrations indicate cooperativity in anion binding. ESEEM experiments on the azide- and cyanide-free enzyme reveal hyperfine (A = 2.88 MHz) and electric quadrupolar couplings (e2qQ = 2.29 MHz and \xce\xb7 = 0.58) for a single 14N nucleus of the protein. These parameters are slightly altered upon addition of azide or cyanide, but ESEEM studies with 15N-labeled versions of these inhibitors show that the altered modulation is also due to protein-derived 14N. The ESEEM experiments show no evidence for coupling of azide- or cyanide-derived nitrogens to the Mn cluster. The outer shell scattering in the EXAFS suggests coordination of histidines to the binuclear Mn cluster, and the quadrupolar couplings observed for the protein-derived ESEEM detectable 14N nucleus are consistent with those expected for a histidine imidazole coordinated to Mn(IV). Taken together, these results suggest a model in which azide binds to a protein-derived site, rather than binding directly to either Mn. Despite this indirect binding, azide causes minor perturbations in the Mn2(\xce\xbc-O)2 geometry, consistent with a slight flattening of the Mn2 core. "
"Coplanar nanostructures consisting of two different types of organosilane monolayers have been fabricated using scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) and served as templates for the area-selective immobilization of various materials. The first organosilane monolayer, which had been uniformly prepared on a substrate, was locally degraded through electrochemistry of adsorbed water at the junction of the monolayer and the SPM probe. This probe-scanned region chemisorbed molecules of the second organosilane, resulting in the creation of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) confined to the SPM-defined pattern. Latex nanoparticles or proteins selectively assembled onto this patterned SAM. "
"Photoinduced electron transfer within donor\xe2\x88\x92(salt bridge)\xe2\x88\x92acceptor complexes has been investigated. We now report the first comparative study of electron transfer through an asymmetric salt bridge interface formed from the 1:1 association of an amidinium to a carboxylate via two hydrogen bonds. Laser flash excitation prompts an electron to transfer from a highly reducing excited state of a derivatized Ru(II) bipyridine donor complex to a dinitrobenzene acceptor juxtaposed by the salt bridge interface. The rate of electron transfer through the D\xe2\x88\x92(amidinium\xe2\x88\x92carboxylate)\xe2\x88\x92A salt bridge is \xe2\x88\xbc102 times slower than that for the pair when the interface is switched, D\xe2\x88\x92(carboxylate\xe2\x88\x92amidinium)\xe2\x88\x92A. This large difference shows that a salt bridge can significantly influence the kinetics of electron transfer and, accordingly, bears considerably on electron transport within the biological milieu of proteins and enzymes.

"Computational studies on ketyl anion radicals with methyl chloride and on \xcf\x89-chloroalkanal radical anions, Cl(CH2)nC(H)O-\xe2\x80\xa2 (n = 2, 3), find competing mechanisms:\xe2\x80\x89 a dissociative electron transfer (ET) mechanism and a substitution (SUB(C)) mechanism leading to a C-alkylation product. H(CN)CO-\xe2\x80\xa2/CH3Cl proceeds unequivocally via the SUB(C) mechanism, and \xcf\x89-chloroalkanal radical anions proceed by the ET mechanism, but the interpretation of the mechanism for H2CO-\xe2\x80\xa2/CH3Cl depends on the coordinate system used to explore the path. The steepest descent path in Z-matrix internal coordinates leads to the ET product at both the ROHF/6-31G* and UHF/6-31G* levels. The mass-weighted path leads to the ET product on the restricted open-shell Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock (ROHF) surface but to the SUB(C) product on the unrestricted Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock (UHF) surface. A valley\xe2\x88\x92ridge inflection point heading in the direction of ET products was located on the mass-weighted UHF path, indicating that the potential energy surface branches toward ET products. Closer examination of the two-dimensional portion of the surface shows that the potential energy surface for this reaction descends from the transition state to a broad saddle point region and branches into two valleys:\xe2\x80\x89 one leading to the ET product and the other to the SUB(C) product. The ridge and saddle point region on the UHF surface are at lower energy and longer C\xe2\x88\x92C and C\xe2\x88\x92Cl bond lengths than on the ROHF surface, allowing the UHF mass-weighted reaction path to traverse the ridge into the SUB(C) valley. On the ROHF surface as the path descends from the transition state, the H2CO-\xe2\x80\xa2 moiety continues to approach the methyl chloride while the C\xe2\x88\x92Cl bond lengthens, but then recoils to give the ET products. Cross-sections of the surface calculated at the UQCISD(T)/6-31G* level resemble the UHF cross-sections, indicating that the branching of the potential surface into two mechanisms is expected at this level, too. Thus, whereas from inspection of the surface in internal coordinates, the OCH2C\xe2\x88\x92CH3\xe2\x88\x92Cl- transition state connects to the ET product, the mass-weighted path can cross the broad and shallow ridge and bifurcate thereafter to ET and SUB(C) products. Our study reveals a scenario where a group of isostructural transition states define a mechanistic family consisting of substitution, electron transfer, and borderline situations. Molecular dynamics studies may be necessary to explore the borderline situations. "
"The Schellman motif is a widely observed, helix terminating structural motif in proteins, which is achieved by the adoption of a left-handed helical (\xce\xb1L) conformation by a C-terminus residue. The resulting hydrogen bonding pattern involves an intramolecular 6 \xe2\x86\x92 1 interaction. This helix terminating motif is readily mimicked in synthetic helical peptides by placing an achiral residue at the penultimate position of the helix. The crystal structure of the heptapeptide Boc-Leu-Aib-Val-Gly-Leu-Aib-Val-OMe (1) reveals a 310-helix terminated by a Schellman motif with Aib(6) adopting an \xce\xb1L - conformation. The crystals are in the space group P21 with a = 9.958(3)\xc3\x85, b = 20.447(3)\xc3\x85, c = 11.723 (2)\xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 99.74(2)\xc2\xb0, and Z = 2. The final R1 and wR2 values are 7.2% and 18.9%, respectively, for 1731 observed reflections [I \xe2\x89\xa5 2\xcf\x83(I)]. A 6 \xe2\x86\x92 1 hydrogen bond between Aib(2)CO-\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89-Val(7)NH and a 5 \xe2\x86\x92 2 hydrogen bond between Val(3)CO-\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89-Aib(6)NH are observed. An analysis of several \xce\xb1L terminated helical peptides in crystals suggests that the medium range Ci\xce\xb1H-\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89-Ni+3H [d\xce\xb1N(i,i+3)] and Ci\xce\xb1H-\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89-Ni+4H [d\xce\xb1N(i,i+4)] interproton distances are indeed characteristic of the Schellman motif. NMR studies in CDCl3 establish retention of the 310-helical conformation with key NOEs demonstrating the persistence of the conformation determined in crystals. The present study demonstrates the identification of the Schellman motif in solution in a synthetic helical peptide. "
"First-time applications of solid-state exchange 13C NMR techniques to the study of the reorientation dynamics of hydrocarbon molecules adsorbed on zeolites have enabled the geometry and time scales of molecular hopping processes between adjacent adsorption sites to be characterized directly and model free. Two-dimensional exchange 13C NMR on static samples establishes the geometry of the site-hopping dynamics, while one-dimensional magic-angle spinning (MAS) exchange-induced-sidebands (EIS) 13C NMR permits motional correlation times on the order of milliseconds to seconds to be extracted directly from the experimental data. Variable-temperature experiments performed on Ca-LSX zeolite samples with average bulk loadings of 0.5, 1, and 2 benzene molecules per supercage yield apparent Arrhenius activation energies of about 66 \xc2\xb1 6 kJ mol-1 for the discrete, localized reorientation dynamics of benzene molecules among different Ca2+ cation adsorption sites (\xe2\x88\xbc0.5 nm apart). Arrhenius preexponential factors were established to be on the order of 1 \xc3\x97 1012 s-1, consistent with elementary hopping processes. Motional correlation times exhibit only minor variations upon changes in benzene loading over the range studied. "
"Inelastic neutron scattering is a form of vibrational spectroscopy for which the measured scattering intensities are directly related to vibrational amplitudes, allowing, in principle, convenient comparison with theoretical dynamical models. However, until recently, neutron sources and instruments have not allowed spectra to be collected on globular proteins with useful energy resolutions in the frequency range of most macromolecular vibrations (\xe2\x88\xbc50\xe2\x88\x923500 cm-1). The construction of the time-focussing crystal analyzer (TFXA) spectrometer at the ISIS pulsed neutron source near Oxford has changed this situation, allowing high-resolution spectra to be obtained over the whole frequency range of interest. We present here TFXA vibrational spectra of the enzyme, Staphylococcal nuclease, and compare the results with spectra calculated from a normal mode analysis of the protein using the program CHARMM (see ref 1). The calculated spectral intensities, which were obtained using a force field that was not refined to fit the present experimental data, are in general agreement with experiment and are used to assign the peaks.

"Short transverse relaxation times of C\xce\xb1 and H\xce\xb1 single-quantum states in proteins reduce signal-to-noise ratios of heteronuclear correlation experiments involving transfers of C\xce\xb1 and H\xce\xb1 coherences. To overcome this \xe2\x80\x9cshort transverse relaxation problem\xe2\x80\x9d, we have developed a simultaneous 1H and 13C constant-time (sim-CT) heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (HMQC) scheme. New features in this design include:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) utilization of heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherences for better transverse relaxation properties, (ii) concatenation of proton evolution into the simultaneous 1H and 13C constant-time period to eliminate separate time periods for proton evolution, and (iii) use of simultaneous 1H and 13C constant-time to remove resonance splitting due to multiple two- and three-bond homo- and heteronuclear scalar couplings. This general approach for sensitivity enhancement is demonstrated for the HA(CA)(CO)NH triple-resonance experiment. Results on proteins show that, compared with the heteronuclear single-quantum coherence version of the same experiment, on average the sim-CT HMQC version of HA(CA)(CO)NH exhibits enhancements of \xe2\x88\xbc20%.

"The transition state for subtilisin-catalyzed transesterification was probed by high-pressure kinetic studies in solvents spanning a wide range of dielectric constants. The electrostatic model of Kirkwood described the solvent effects and gave a lower limit of 31 \xc2\xb1 1.5 Debye for the dipole moment of the transition state. This value remained constant in a wide range of polar and apolar solvents, indicating that the catalytic triad of subtilisin is remarkably robust. Despite the highly polar transition state, substantial rate enhancements relative to the uncatalyzed reaction were measured in highly apolar solvents such as hexane; this is the first report of such an extreme disparity between transition-state and solvent polarities. Moreover, the solvent dependence of the activation volume implies a low effective dielectric of the polypeptide chain in the active site and substantial penetration of the active site by solvent. Kirkwood\'s model was also used to quantify the effect of an active-site mutation on the transition-state dipole moment. These results illustrate that the electrostatic model combined with high-pressure kinetics can provide unique information on the basic properties of enzyme reaction processes and can be useful in predicting solvent effects on enzyme reaction rates.

"This work examines the electrostatic interactions involved in the recognition of d-Ala-d-Ala (dAdA) by vancomycin (Van) by using capillary electrophoresis (CE) and affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE). Acetylation of the N-terminal amine of Van decreases its affinity for Di-Ac-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala (Ac2KdAdA) by a factor of 11 at pH 7.1 (from 4.3 \xce\xbcM to 48 \xce\xbcM). Succinylation of the N-terminus of Van introduces a pendant negative charge that further decreases its affinity for Ac2KdAdA about 2-fold at pH 7.1. The association of Ac-d-Ala-d-Ala (AcdAdA) with Van shifts the pKa of the N-terminal amine of Van by 1.7 units from 7.1 to 8.8, and thus changes its net charge in the range of values of pH between 6 and 10. The electrostatic interaction between the \xe2\x88\x92CO2- group of the dAdA moiety and the \xe2\x88\x92NH2+CH3 group of Van contributes approximately 5.9 kJ/mol to the free energy of binding of these species. In addition to establishing or confirming these thermodynamic parameters, this paper illustrates the use of CE as a physical-organic tool in examining electrostatic interactions in biomolecular recognition.

"1H NMR is used to characterize the solution electronic structure and magnetic properties of the cubane iron\xe2\x88\x92sulfur clusters for wild-type (WT) and the D14C and D14S cluster ligand mutants of the ferredoxin (Fd) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus with the goal of identifying the oxidation states of the individual iron ligated by a particular protein ligand. Sequence-specific assignments of the contact-shifted and paramagnetically relaxed protons for all cluster ligands are obtained in the alternate cluster oxidation states, [4Fe:4S]+, [4Fe:4S]2+, each with Cys21 and Cys48 either as free sulfhydryls or in a disulfide bond. Detailed analysis of the oxidized cluster Fds shows that the ground state is S = 0 with similar population of excited S = 1 and 2 states for each of Asp14, Ser14, or Cys14 ligated to the cluster. The reduced cluster D14C Fd exhibits pairs of Cys (Cys11,Cys17) with strong Curie, and pairs of Cys (Cys14, Cys56) with strong anti-Curie temperature dependence diagnostic of ligands to the S = 9/2, 2Fe2.5+, and S = 4, 2Fe2.0+ iron pairs, respectively. Moreover, it is observed that the ligand protons of Cys ligated to the mixed-valence pair are much more effectively relaxed than the Cys ligated to the diferrous pair, which is consistent with expectations for the relative spin magnetizations of the iron pair. Substitution of Cys14 by Ser14 leads to changes in contact shift magnitudes and slopes in Curie plots that demonstrate the presence of two electronic states that interchange the sequence positions of the 2Fe2.5+ and 2Fe2.0+. Similarly, replacement of Cys14 by Asp14 leads to changes in shift magnitude and Curie slope that indicate the population of two states for which the Asp14 is ligated to a Fe2.5+ and Cys11 is ligated to a Fe2.0+ in each state, while the other two ligands showed effective oxidation states midway between Fe2.5+ and Fe2.0+. Thus the relative stabilization of the mixed-valence pair for the iron ligated by residue 14 is Asp > Ser > Cys. The localization of the mixed-valence pair to the irons ligated to Cys11 and 17 in both D14C- and D14S-Fd is significantly stabilized for the disulfide relative to the free sulfhydryl form of Cys21 and Cys48, and likely reflects on a hydrogen bond between the backbones of Cys17 and Cys21. Ligation by cyanide in reduced WT Fd yields a contact shift pattern indicative of the same electronic state as for the Cys14 mutant, with cyanide ligated to one of the 2Fe2.0+. The conversion of a Fe2.5+ ligated by Asp in WT Fd to a Fe2.0+ upon cyanide displacement of the Asp is consistent with EPR and ENDOR studies (Telser, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 5133\xe2\x88\x925140; Telser et al., submitted for publication). "
"We analyze conformational stereoisomerism in the sterically hindered 4a,4b-dihydrophenanthrenes of C2 symmetry. In these labile photointermediates, steric hindrance brought about by disubstitution at the 4 and 5 positions or by benzoannelation at the [c] and [g] bonds allows observation of two interconvertible intermediates denoted as L and S. In such molecules, theoretical analysis suggests two low-energy structures (C and T). These differ in the chirality of the polyene perimeter helix for one given configuration of the 4a,4b-ethane unit. C and T can be distinguished by the position of atom pair H4a, X4, or of the equivalent atom pair H4b, X5 with respect to the the mean molecular plane. In C, atoms H4a and X4 are on one side of the mean molecular plane, while in T atoms H4a and X4 are on opposite sides of this plane. The same holds for the atom pair H4b, X5. The C conformation is assigned to the primary photocyclization product (L modification) in which the intersubstituent distance X4\xe2\x88\x92X5 is short and where the angular hydrogens are quasi-antiperiplanar. This is the regular conformation of the unhindered 4a,4b-dihydrophenanthrenes. The T conformation is assigned to the secondary conformers (S modification) formed spontaneously from the primary L product. Here the distances H4a\xe2\x88\x92X5 and H4b\xe2\x88\x92X4 are short, and in the case of severe steric hindrance (X = t-Bu) the angular hydrogens are anticlinal. The observed stability order (usually S > L at around room temperature, except in the 4,5-dimethyl, 4,5-di-tert-butyl, and 4,5-dichloro molecules) is the outcome of steric hindrance opposing skeletal deformations. X4\xe2\x88\x92X5 steric interactions are dominant in the C forms while the H4a\xe2\x88\x92X5 and H4b\xe2\x88\x92X4 interactions (and corresponding interactions in the [c] and [g] dibenzoannelated systems) play a foremost role in the T forms. Computed strain energies for C and T reproduce the observed stability trends of L and S modifications. Differences in visible absorption band energies are traced to different extents of departure from planarity of the polyene perimeter. The L intermediates assigned to the more planar C structure are thus predicted to absorb at longer wavelengths. The low intensity of the visible band in the L modifications is attributed to symmetry-imposed cancelling-out of one-ethylene-bond transition moments. The present analysis explains also the simultaneous existence and the observed range of values of potential barriers separating the two modifications. The present analysis changes the previous structure assignment for the S and L modifications of the dibenzo system, leading to full agreement with the observed trend of the electronic spectra of the S and L modifications. Similar considerations applied to the 4a,4b-dimethyl system suggest that its labile low-temperature intermediate (\xce\xbbmax = 360 nm) could have a T-like conformation. "
"Experimental and theoretical studies of intramolecular assistance by carbonyl groups and heteroatoms in the electron transfer driven cleavage of the carbon\xe2\x88\x92tin bond of tetraalkylstannanes has been carried out. Carbonyl groups and heteroatoms (oxygen and nitrogen) in an appropriate position of tetraalkylstannane facilitate the electron transfer and selective cleavage of the carbon\xe2\x88\x92tin bond. Although the coordination of the carbonyl groups and heteroatoms to tin was not detected in the neutral molecules, molecular orbital calculations indicate that the coordination of such groups to tin in the cation radical intermediate stabilizes the system and weakens the carbon\xe2\x88\x92tin bond. These results offer striking examples of the intramolecular assistance of electron transfer driven reactions. "
"Iodonium ylides of the form ArINSO2Ar\xe2\x80\x98 (Ar = m-tolyl, Ar\xe2\x80\x98 = p-nitrophenyl (1); Ar = m-tolyl, Ar\xe2\x80\x98 = phenyl (2); Ar = m-tolyl, Ar\xe2\x80\x98 = p-tolyl (3); Ar, Ar\xe2\x80\x98 = p-tolyl (4)) have been prepared and crystallographically characterized. Comparisons to previously structurally characterized members of this class of materials (PhINTs (Ts = p-toluenesulfonyl), o-TolylINTs, MesINTs) demonstrate that apparently minor perturbations of the aromatic rings have substantial consequences on the supramolecular assemblies of these materials. The structures range from zig\xe2\x88\x92zag polymers (PhINTs, MesINTs), linear polymers (o-TolylINTs), layered structures (1), two-dimensional ladders (2, 3, o-TolylINTs), to even three-dimensional stepladders (4). Ab initio calculations for a model molecule, PhINSO2Ph, corroborate the presence of a I\xe2\x88\x92N single bond and show considerable charges being localized on the I, N, S, and O atoms (+, \xe2\x88\x92, +, and \xe2\x88\x92 charges, respectively). Extensive attractive networks of I\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O and I\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N secondary bonds thus dominate the solid-state polymers. Within the monomeric units of ArINSO2Ar\xe2\x80\x98, a U-turn-shaped motif is observed. This structural shape appears to optimize secondary bonding contacts between charged INSO2 arrays. The structures of ArINSO2Ar\xe2\x80\x98 have been systematically characterized. "
"A general and convenient synthesis of carbohydrate 2-C-analogs by addition of malonates to glycals is described. The method is applicable to glycals derived from hexoses and pentoses and is characterized by easily available precursors. The reactions are mediated by manganese(III) or cerium(IV) and proceed via intermediarily generated malonyl radicals. All additions exhibit a very high degree of regioselectivity, since only 2-C-branched sugars were obtained. This result can be best rationalized by favorable orbital interactions between the SOMO of the malonyl radical and the HOMO of the double bond. Variation of the steric demand of the malonate or the glycal allows the stereoselectivities to be increased up to >98%. Highest selectivities were obtained with tri-O-acetyl-d-galactal and di-O-acetyl-d-arabinal, where the attack occurs exclusively from one face of the carbohydrate. For all cerium(IV)-mediated reactions, methyl glycosides are formed as main products in 73\xe2\x88\x9289% yield, which can be isolated in analytically pure form on a gram scale. Strong evidence was found for a ligand transfer rather than electron transfer during the formation of carbohydrate 1-nitrates, which sheds light on the mechanism of transition-metal-mediated radical reactions. In terms of starting materials, stereoselectivities, and yields, the herein described method for the synthesis of carbohydrate 2-C-analogs is superior to literature known procedures. "
"The synthesis and characterization of the open-chain and cyclic sapphyrin dimers 2\xe2\x88\x924 and 7, bearing various bisamide spacers is reported. This family of receptors was shown to display excellent recognition properties for various dicarboxylate anions, as judged from mass spectrometric analyses, U-tube aqueous I/CH2Cl2/aqueous II through-model-membrane transport experiments, and equilibrium binding studies. These latter were carried out in either methanol or dichloromethane using 1H or 2H NMR and visible spectroscopic titrations. The flexible, first-generation system 2, featuring a 1,3-bisamidopropane spacer was found to display a high affinity for dicarboxylate anions even in polar solvents, such as methanol. Within a range of substrates, this receptor showed a strong preference toward linear over bent, and aromatic over aliphatic dicarboxylate anions, a fact that is readily rationalized in terms of extra, stabilizing \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80, CH\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xcf\x80, or CH\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N interactions. This latter CH\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N hydrogen-binding motif was observed in the single crystal structure of the 1:1 complex formed between benzoate anion and the monoprotonated form of sapphyrin 1a. The second-generation, open-chain chiral sapphyrin dimers 3 and 4 (containing (1S,2S)-1,2-bisamidocyclohexane and (S)-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bisamido-1,1\xe2\x80\x98-binaphthalene chiral auxiliaries, respectively) were found to form strong complexes with N-carbobenzyloxy-protected aspartate and glutamate anions (Ka values are on the order of 104\xe2\x88\x92105 M-1 in 19:1 (v/v) dichloromethane\xe2\x88\x92methanol), and displayed a preference for glutamate over aspartate, with receptor 4 showing a modest level of enantiomeric selectivity. The cyclic dimer 7 binds these anions less effectively, but displays excellent chiral discrimination between the d- and l-antipodal forms of N-carbobenzyloxy-protected glutamate anion. "
"Molecular association of various aromatic hydrocarbons (D, including sterically hindered donors) with a representative group of diverse acceptors (A = quinone, trinitrobenzene, tetracyanoethylene, tropylium, tetranitromethane, and nitrosonium) is visually apparent in solution by the spontaneous appearance of distinctive colors. Spectral (UV\xe2\x88\x92vis) analyses of the colored solutions reveal their charge-transfer origin (\xce\xbbCT), and they provide quantitative information of the intermolecular association in the form of the KDA and \xce\xb5CT values for the formation and visualization, respectively, of different [D,A] complexes. Importantly, such measurements establish charge-transfer absorption to be a sensitive analytical tool for evaluating the steric inhibition of donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor association. For example, the steric differences among various hindered aromatic donors in their association with quinone are readily dramatized in their distinctive charge-transfer (color) absorptions and verified by X-ray crystallography of the charge-transfer crystals and/or QUANTA molecular modeling calculations of optimum intermolecular separations allowed by van der Waals contacts.

"We report the synthesis of a completely new, stable class of inorganic salts named the dinitramide salts. These salts are based on a newly discovered nitrogen oxide anion known as the dinitramide anion. The dinitramide anion is a uniquely stable, high oxygen density grouping that can be prepared in many salt combinations including the ammonium or hydrazinium salts. The dinitramide anion has both fundamental scientific interest and practical applications. We describe here the synthesis of dinitramide salts and give a preliminary report on their properties. "
"The crystal structures of the ammonium, 1, lithium, 2, potassium, 3, and cesium, 4, salts of a new nitrogen oxy anion, N3O4-, have been determined. In 1 there are two interpenetrating three-dimensional lattices linked by strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between all four ammonium protons and three of the four dinitramide oxygen atoms. Even though 2\xe2\x88\x924 have similar formula units each has a completely different structure characterized by differing coordination numbers and geometries. The structure of 2 is unique in that it is the only one containing a dinitramide ion in the C2 conformation predicted by ab initio studies to be the minimum energy conformation. There is good agreement between the predicted and experimental metrical parameters for the C2 conformer of the dinitramide anion. "
"The extrusion of methane from (2-phosphininyl)(methyl) zirconocenes 3a\xe2\x88\x92c at 80 \xc2\xb0C in benzene affords the corresponding \xce\xb72-phosphabenzyne\xe2\x88\x92zirconocene dimers 4a\xe2\x88\x92c, one of which has been characterized by X-ray crystal structure analysis. The parameters of the C\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92Zr three-membered ring are exactly similar to those found in the \xce\xb72-benzyne\xe2\x88\x92zirconocene complex:\xe2\x80\x89 C\xe2\x88\x92C, 1.361(2); C\xe2\x88\x92Zr, 2.238 and 2.250(2) \xc3\x85. The P\xe2\x88\x92Zr distances are normal at 2.6857(5) and 2.6922(5) \xc3\x85. The reaction of these \xce\xb72-phosphabenzyne complexes with acetonitrile, Ph3PS, (diphenylphosphino)- and (trimethylsilyl)alkynes, aldehydes, and (+)-camphor have been investigated. In all cases, an insertion into the C2\xe2\x88\x92Zr bond is observed. Hydrolysis of the intermediate zirconacycles thus obtained yielded several new 2-functional phosphinines, including a thiol (6), a vinylphosphine (8), two secondary alcohols (14 and 15), and an homochiral phosphinine-substituted alcohol (17). The regiospecificity of the insertion is ascribed to the huge concentration of negative charge at the \xce\xb1-position of the phosphinine ring. "
"New asymmetrical ligands (H2L) have been synthesized to provide both a bridging and a terminal phenolate to a pair of iron ions in order to mimic the binding of a single terminal tyrosinate at the diiron center of the purple acid phosphatases. H2L1 is 2-[(bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amino)methyl]-6-[((2-pyridylmethyl)(2-phenol)amino)methyl]-4-methylphenol and H2L\xe2\x80\x981 and H2L2 are obtained by replacing the 2-phenol group by the 5-nitro-2-phenol and the 6-methyl-2-phenol residues, respectively. A series of mixed valence diiron complexes [FeIIFeIIIL(X)2](Y) have been obtained where (X)2 is the dianion of m-phenylenedipropionate or (H2PO4)2 and Y = BPh4 or PF6 (L = L1, 1a (X)2 = mpdp, Y = BPh4, 1b:\xe2\x80\x89 (X)2 = (OAc)2, Y = BPh4, 1c:\xe2\x80\x89 (X)2 = (OBz)2, Y = BPh4, 1d:\xe2\x80\x89 (X)2 = (H2PO4)2, Y = PF6; L = L\xe2\x80\x981:\xe2\x80\x89 1\xe2\x80\x98a (X)2 = mpdp, Y = BPh4; L = L2:\xe2\x80\x89 2c:\xe2\x80\x89 (X)2 = (OBz)2, Y = BPh4, 2d:\xe2\x80\x89 (X)2 = (H2PO4)2, Y = PF6. Diferric complexes have been obtained also either by direct synthesis or by iodine oxidation of the mixed valence precursor (L = L1, 3a (X)2 = mpdp, Y = BPh4, 3d:\xe2\x80\x89 (X)2 = (H2PO4)2, Y = PF6; L = L2, 4d:\xe2\x80\x89 (X)2 = (H2PO4)2, Y = PF6. Complex 1a [FeIIFeIIIL(mpdp)](BPh4) has been characterized by X-ray diffraction techniques. 1a crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/a with the following unit cell parameters:\xe2\x80\x89 a = 22.038 (9) \xc3\x85, b = 16.195 (8) \xc3\x85, c = 16.536 (7) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 97.26 (1)\xc2\xb0, Z = 4. The significant differences in the Fe\xe2\x88\x92O bond lengths indicate that the metal centers are ordered. The complexes have been studied by electronic spectral, resonance Raman, magnetic susceptibility, M\xc3\xb6ssbauer, NMR, and electrochemical techniques. M\xc3\xb6ssbauer and NMR spectroscopies concur to probe that the valences of the mixed valence compounds are trapped in solution as well as in the solid state at room temperature. The electronic spectrum of the mixed-valence compounds are dominated by a charge transfer transition in the 400\xe2\x88\x92600 nm domain which moves to the 550\xe2\x88\x92660 nm range upon oxidation to the diferric state. In addition they exhibit a weak and broad intervalence transition close to 1100 nm. Electrochemical studies show that the systems exist in the three redox states FeIIFeII /FeIIFeIII /FeIIIFeIII. Moreover they show that the introduction of the terminal phenol group results in a thermodynamic destabilization of the diferrous state higher than the stabilization of the diferric state. An expanded stability domain of the mixed valence state is therefore observed which is probably due mostly to the asymmetry of the compounds. In addition a chemical destabilization of the reduced state of 1a, 1c, and 1\xe2\x80\x98a is observed. Comparison of the carboxylate and phosphate derivatives leads to attribute it to the partial dissociation in solution of the carboxylate oxygen trans to the phenolate. The latter feature bears an intrinsic resemblance with the dissociation of iron which is observed when purple acid phosphatases are reduced by dithionite. These studies clearly show the importance of tyrosine binding on the redox properties of the PAP enzymes. This questions the relationship of such a redox specificity with a hydrolytic function and raises the possibility that the latter may be redox regulated or that another (redox based) function is actually involved, possibly in line with the ability of the enzymes to react with peroxides.

"The synthesis and characterization of seven bis-pyridine and bis-imidazole complexes of iron(II) tetramesitylporphyrinate are reported. X-ray crystal structures of three of the complexes, [Fe(TMP)(4-CNPy)2], [Fe(TMP)(3-CNPy)2], and [Fe(TMP)(4-MePy)2], have been solved and all show parallel axial ligand orientations with nearly planar porphyrinato cores. The M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectra of six of the complexes, having pyridine ligands with pKa(PyH+) ranging from \xe2\x88\xbc1.1 (4-CNPy) to 9.7 (4-NMe2Py), have been determined. The M\xc3\xb6ssbauer isomer shifts at 120 K are in the range of 0.36\xe2\x88\x920.45 mm/s, and the quadrupole splittings (\xce\x94EQ) are in the range of 1.11\xe2\x88\x921.27 mm/s. Thus, unlike the corresponding Fe(III) complexes, the X-ray structures and M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectroscopic parameters of these (tetramesitylporphyrinato)iron(II)\xe2\x88\x92bis(pyridine) complexes are shown to be essentially independent of the basicity and \xcf\x80 donor/acceptor properties of the axial pyridine ligands. These solid-state structural and spectroscopic properties are compared to the thermodynamic properties of the same series of complexes in solution (Nesset, M. J. M.; Shokhirev, N. V.; Enemark, P. D.; Jacobson, S. E.; Walker, F. A. Inorg. Chem. 1996, 35, 5188):\xe2\x80\x89 The equilibrium constants, \xce\xb22II, for binding two ligands to [FeII(TMP)(DMF)] are also nearly independent of the basicity of the axial pyridine ligand, although the FeIII/FeII reduction potentials vary strongly with ligand basicity due to the large variation in \xce\xb22III, the equilibrium constant for binding two ligands to the Fe(III) complex. Hence, it appears that low-spin d6 metalloporphyrins have a marked preference for parallel orientation of planar axial ligands, and that the charge asymmetry at the iron nucleus (deduced from M\xc3\xb6ssbauer quadrupole splittings) and the thermodynamics of ligand binding are unaffected by the electronic properties of the axial ligand. The major reason for the marked preference for parallel ligand orientation for iron(II) porphyrinates appears to be lack of a means of energy stabilization of the ruffled core of the perpendicular orientation.

"Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra for each of the interstitials within centered [(Zr6Z)Cli12Cla6-nLn]m- clusters (Z = Be, B, C, N, Mn, and Co; L = Cl-, AlCl4-, CH3CN, and/or PPh3; n = 0\xe2\x88\x926) are reported. For C- and Mn-centered clusters, chemical shifts for both solids and solutions have been measured. Chemical shifts for B-centered clusters were measured in solution. Chemical shifts for Be-, N-, and Co-centered clusters were measured in the solid state. Interstitial carbide resonances for all 10 axially substituted species ({[(Zr6C)Cl12](CH3CN)nCl6-n}n-4, n = 0\xe2\x88\x926) have been located; their chemical shifts range from 457.7 ppm for {[(Zr6C)Cl12]Cl6}4- to 480.1 ppm for {[(Zr6C)Cl12](CH3CN)6}2+. 11B chemical shifts for boride-centered clusters ({[(Zr6B)Cl12](CH3CN)nCl6-n}n-5, n = 0\xe2\x88\x925) range from 185 to 193.8 ppm. 11B and 13C data reveal the axially bound chlorides to be substitutionally inert. Chemical shifts for 55Mn-centered clusters range from 5359 ppm (isotropic) for solid RbZr6Cl14Mn to 5618 ppm for [(Zr6Mn)Cl12Cl6]5- in a Cl--rich molten salt. These are the most deshielded manganese compounds presently known. Solid-state 9Be for K3Zr6Cl15Be, 15N for Zr6Cl15N, and 59Co for Zr6Cl15Co reveal chemical shifts of 77.1, 271, and 4082 ppm, respectively (the 9Be data is not corrected for the second-order quadrupolar contribution). A discussion of the origin of large paramagnetic shielding contributions to the chemical shifts of the interstitial atoms is given. "
"1,4,7-Triazacyclononane (L) and its methylated analog (L\xe2\x80\x98) form complexes with zeolite-exchanged Mn2+, Co2+, or Cu2+. Through comparison with diluted solutions of the complexes, the effect of the zeolite environment on the complex formation was evaluated. In the case of Mn2+, the complexation was monitored by observing the zero-field splitting in the X- and Q-band ESR spectra of the Mn2+ ion. Adsorption of L into metal Y zeolites yields bis L complexes; the L\xe2\x80\x98 mono complexes are formed. The latter complexes are not coordinated by the zeolite surface, as deduced from the spectral parameters of the [Mn(L\xe2\x80\x98)]2+ and [Cu(L\xe2\x80\x98)]2+ complexes. Mono [Co(L\xe2\x80\x98)]2+ in the zeolite is a reversible dioxygen binder, a property not previously documented for these complexes in solution. Exposure of [Mn(L)2]2+ or [Mn(L\xe2\x80\x98)]2+ containing Y zeolites to H2O2 results in intraporous formation of oxidized Mn dimers. The constrained zeolite environment seems to stabilize the oxidized dimers of Mn and L by preventing further cluster expansion. "
"Macroscopically oriented silicate\xe2\x88\x92surfactant liquid crystals are produced by slow cooling of lamellar and hexagonal mesophases through their isotropic\xe2\x88\x92anisotropic phase transition in an 11.7 T magnetic field. Comparisons of in situ experimental and simulated 2H NMR spectra quantify the degrees of orientational order in the silicate\xe2\x88\x92surfactant liquid crystals. The overall orientations of the mesophases with respect to the applied magnetic field depend upon the combined diamagnetic susceptibilities of the individual molecular species in the multicomponent surfactant\xe2\x88\x92silicate mixtures. As a result, macroscopic alignment of these liquid crystalline systems can be controlled by adjusting their composition:\xe2\x80\x89 lamellar or hexagonal domains are shown to adopt different orientations, according to the diamagnetic susceptibilities of different organic additives present in otherwise identical mixtures. These results demonstrate the utility of liquid crystal processing strategies for organizing inorganic\xe2\x88\x92organic hybrid materials over mesoscopic and macroscopic length scales. "
"The validity of the traditional resonance model for the amide and thioamide functional groups is examined by calculating the planar and rotated conformations of formamide and thioformamide with and without allowing for the delocalization of the nitrogen\'s lone pair. The vertical delocalization energies are found to be quite significant, in support of the traditional view that resonance is an important feature of the electronic structure of amides and thioamides. The rotational barriers are however not solely due to conjugation; they also partly arise from the preferred orientation of the nitrogen\'s lone pair as perpendicular to the molecular plane, even in the absence of conjugation. The resonance stabilization of the planar conformers is responsible for about one-half of the rotational barrier of formamide and two-thirds of that of thioformamide. The larger rotational barrier of thioformamide is therefore due to a greater importance of conjugation effects relative to formamide. "
"Accurate (rms error \xe2\x88\xbc3 ppm) predictions of 13C chemical shifts are achieved for many of the common structural types of organic molecules through empirical scaling of shieldings calculated from gauge including atomic orbitals (GIAO) theory with a small basis set and with geometries obtained from computationally inexpensive molecular mechanics methods. Earlier GIAO calculations are shown to be much better at predicting relative chemical shifts when density functional theory with the B3LYP hybrid functional is used to account for electron correlation, in comparison with Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock calculations. The GIAO isotropic shieldings need to be empirically scaled to achieve good numerical agreement with experimental \xce\xb4C. GIAO calculations with different small basis sets are compared for a set of 38 model compounds containing C, H, O, and N with MMX and MM3 force fields and B3LYP/6-31G* optimizations providing the geometries. The best MM3-based results are obtained with B3LYP/3-21G(X,6-31+G*)//MM3 calculations in which the 3-21G basis set is augmented for heteroatoms with polarization and diffuse functions. The examples of the (E)- and (Z)-2-butenes, axial and equatorial methylcyclohexanes, exo- and endo-2-norbornanols, vulgarin and epivulgarin, and chair and twist-boat forms of 3\xce\xb1-hydroxy-2\xce\xb2-(4-morpholinyl)-5\xce\xb1H-androstan-17-one are examined to establish whether \xce\xb4pred values could determine the structure if only one of each pair of structures were available to provide experimental \xce\xb4C values. The \xce\xb4pred from B3LYP/3-21G(X,6-31+G*)//MM3 calculations are adequate for addressing questions of conformation and relative stereochemistry. "
"In a previous study, we have shown that halide salts of the protonated Schiff base (pSB) of all-trans-retinal with aniline crystallize in the 6-s-trans conformation. These compounds are therefore better solid state models for the chromophores of the all-trans states of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) than the conventional butyl imine compounds. We have now extended these studies to the halide salts of the pSB of 13-cis-retinal with aniline. The 5-13C chemical shifts again indicate 6-s-trans conformations. These compounds are thus good models for the chromophores of the 13-cis photocycle intermediates of bR. As for the all-trans compounds, the frequencies of maximum visible absorbance and the 15N chemical shifts of the 13-cis compounds are linearly related to the strength of the pSB\xe2\x88\x92counterion (CI) interaction as measured by (1/d2), where d is the center-to-center distance between the pSB charge and the CI charge. However, the relationship is steeper for the 13-cis compounds. With these calibrations, we estimate that d = 4.0, 3.9, 3.7, 3.6, and 3.8 \xc3\x85 (\xc2\xb10.3 \xc3\x85) for the J625, K590, L550, N520, and bR555 states of bR, respectively. These distances compare with similarly determined values of about 4.16 \xc2\xb1 0.03 and 4.66 \xc2\xb1 0.04 \xc3\x85 for the all-trans bR568 and O640 states, respectively. The results suggest that the pSB\xe2\x88\x92CI interaction is stronger in all the 13-cis photocycle intermediates, including the red-shifted J and K intermediates, than in bR568. The apparent tightening of the pSB\xe2\x88\x92CI interaction in the J \xe2\x86\x92 N sequence is consistent with models of the early photocycle in which electrostatic attractions between the pSB and counterions constitute an important constraint.

"F2\xe2\x80\xa2+ ions have been generated in the external ion source of a FT-ICR mass spectrometer, and their reactivity with a choice of neutrals, ranging from noble gases to polyatomic molecules, has been investigated. With the exception of He and Ne, all neutrals react with F2\xe2\x80\xa2+ at the collision controlled limit, yielding predominantly electron transfer and fragmentation products. Noteworthy, a formal F+ transfer process takes place from the reaction of F2\xe2\x80\xa2+ with Ar, among the noble gases, and with CO and N2, among diatomic molecules. The unimolecular and bimolecular reactivity of F2H+, obtained from the F2\xe2\x80\xa2+ reaction with H2, allowed the proton affinity of elemental fluorine (PA = 79 \xc2\xb1 5 kcal mol-1) to be experimentally derived. "
"The structures and energies of lithiated cyclopropenyl cations and their acyclic isomers (C3H3-nLin+, n = 0\xe2\x88\x923) have been calculated employing ab initio MO (HF/6-31G*) and density functional theory (DFT, Becke3LYP/6-311+G*) methods. The cyclic isomers (4, 6, 10, and 14) are always favored, but when lithium is substituted sequentially along the C3H3+, C3H2Li+, C3HLi2+, and C3Li3+ series, the acyclic forms (5, 7, 11, 16) become progressively less competitive energetically. A triply bridged c-C3(\xce\xbc-Li)3+ geometry, 14, was preferred over the classical form 3 by 8.7 kcal/mol. A single lithium substituent results in a very large (67 kcal/mol) stabilization of the cyclopropenyl cation. The favorable effects of further lithium substitution are attenuated but are still large:\xe2\x80\x89 48.2 and 40.5 kcal/mol for the second and third replacements, respectively. Comparison with polyamino-substituted cyclopropenyl cations suggest c-C3Li3+ (3 and 14) to be a good candidate for the thermodynamically most stable carbenium ion. The stabilization of the cyclopropenyl cation afforded by the excellent \xcf\x80-donor substituent NH2 (42.8, 33.4, and 23.7 kcal/mol for the first, second and third NH2 groups, respectively) is uniformly lower than the corresponding values for Li substitution. The total stabilization due to two NH2 groups, and a Li (128.2 kcal/mol) is higher than that due to three NH2 groups (99.8 kcal/mol). All the lithiated cyclopropyl radicals are computed to have exceptionally low adiabatic ionization energies (3.2\xe2\x88\x924.3 eV) and even lower than the ionization energies of the alkali metal atoms Li\xe2\x88\x92Cs (4.0\xe2\x88\x925.6 eV). The ionization energy of C3Li3\xe2\x80\xa2 is the lowest (3.18 eV), followed by C3(\xce\xbc-Li)3\xe2\x80\xa2 (3.35 eV). The 1H, 6Li, and 13C NMR data of cyclopropenyl cation and its lithium derivatives indicate the carbon, lithium, and hydrogen chemical shifts to increase with increasing lithium substitution on the ring. The computed 1H chemical shifts and the magnetic susceptibility anisotropies as well as the nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS, based on absolute magnetic shieldings) reveal enhanced aromaticity upon increasing lithium substitution. The B3LYP/6-311+G*-computed vibrational frequencies agree closely with experiment for cyclopropenyl cation and, hence, can be used for the structural characterization of the lithiated and amino species.

"We have studied the dynamic properties of acetylcholinesterase dimer from Torpedo californica liganded with tacrine (AChE\xe2\x88\x92THA) in solution using molecular dynamics. The simulation reveals fluctuations in the width of the primary channel to the active site that are large enough to admit substrates. Alternative entries to the active site through the side walls of the gorge have been detected in a number of structures. This suggests that transport of solvent molecules participating in catalysis can occur across the porous wall, contributing to the efficiency of the enzyme. "
"B3LYP/6-31+G* density functional calculations have been performed in order to understand why large, equilibrium isotope effects have been observed in the reduction of benzene to the corresponding radical anion but not in the reduction of cyclooctatetraene (COT) to COT\xe2\x80\xa2-. The calculations reproduce these experimental trends. However, the calculations also find that reduction of planar COT, like that of benzene, has a substantial, equilibrium isotope effect. Therefore, the small isotope effect, both calculated and observed, for reduction of COT is due to an inverse isotope effect on the planarization of the tub-shaped ring in COT. The isotope effect computed for forming planar (D8h) triplet COT/COT-d8 at 173 K is 0.38. This is the predicted isotope effect on the adiabatic singlet\xe2\x88\x92triplet splitting in COT. The isotope effect computed for forming planar (D4h) singlet COT/COT-d8 at the same temperature is 0.41. This is the predicted isotope effect on ring inversion. The reason why planarization of COT has an inverse isotope effect is discussed, and an experimental test of the prediction of an inverse isotope effect on ring inversion of COT is proposed. "
"The reductive cleavage mechanism and reactivity of the carbon\xe2\x88\x92fluorine bonds in fluoromethylarenes are investigated, in liquid ammonia and in DMF, by means of cyclic voltammetry and/or redox catalysis as a function of the number of fluorine atoms and of the structure of the aryl moiety. The reduction of the trifluoro compounds, eventually leading to complete defluorination, involves the di- and monofluoro derivatives as intermediates. Carbenes do not transpire along the reaction pathway. Application of the intramolecular dissociative electron transfer model allows the quantitative rationalization, in terms of driving force and intrinsic barrier, of the variation of the cleavage reactivity of the primary anion radical with the number of fluorine atoms and of the structure of the aryl moiety as well as with the solvating properties of the medium. When, related to the structural factors thus uncovered, the primary anion radical generates the di- and monofluoro intermediates far from the electrode surface, their reduction occurs homogeneously giving rise to an apparently direct six-electron process according to an internal redox catalysis mechanism. Conversely, with rapid cleavages, the reduction of the di- and monofluoro intermediates takes place at the electrode surface and the stepwise expulsion of the fluorides ions transpire in the cyclic voltammetric patterns. "
"The electrochemical reduction of five dialkyl peroxides in DMF was studied by cyclic voltammetry. The electron transfer (ET) to the selected compounds is concerted with the oxygen\xe2\x88\x92oxygen bond cleavage (dissociative ET) and is independent of the electrode material. Such an electrochemical behavior provided the opportunity to study dissociative ETs by using the mercury electrode and therefore to test the dissociative ET theory by using heterogeneous activation\xe2\x88\x92driving force relationships. The convolution voltammetry analysis coupled to the double-layer correction led to reasonable estimates of the standard potential (E\xc2\xb0) for the dissociative ET to dialkyl peroxides, as supported, whenever possible, by independent estimates. A thermochemical cycle based on the dissociative ET concept was employed to calculate the bond dissociation free energies (BDFEs) of the five peroxides, using the above E\xc2\xb0s together with electrochemical or thermochemical data pertaining to the redox properties of the leaving alkoxide ion. The BDFEs were found to be in the 25\xe2\x88\x9232 kcal/mol range, suggesting a small substituent effect. The dissociative ET E\xc2\xb0s were also used together with the experimental quadratic free energy relationships to estimate the heterogeneous reorganization energies. "
"The synthesis, characterization, thermal stability, optical spectroscopic, electronic structure, and second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) response of a series of donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor bis(salicylaldiminato)nickel(II) Schiff base complexes and the free ligand precursors are reported. The effect of the metal center in such complexes is manifold:\xe2\x80\x89 it templates the formation of acentric molecular structures, imparts high thermal stability to the chelate ring, and both \xe2\x80\x9cswitches on\xe2\x80\x9d and enhances NLO response. Metal complexation imparts new linear optical spectroscopic features, having metal-to-ligand charge transfer character, which are responsible for the second-order nonlinearity. Moreover, the present synthetic strategy represents a novel route to inorganic NLO chromophores. Solution-phase hyperpolarizability values, deduced by electric field-induced second-harmonic-generation experiments are as high as \xe2\x88\x9279 \xc3\x97 10-30 cm5 esu-1 (h\xcf\x89 = 0.92 eV). Experimental linear and nonlinear optical features are fully consistent with INDO/SCI-SOS theoretical calculations. They provide a rationale for the NLO response of these materials and are attractive for designing new, highly efficient second-order nonlinear optical inorganic chromophores. "
"Nitro groups on alternate corners of cubane enhance the acidity of cubyl hydrogen (pKa \xe2\x88\xbc21) and provide sufficient activation for ready anion formation. The sodium salt of 1,3,5,7-tetranitrocubane reacts easily with electrophiles and leads thereby to yet more highly substituted cubanes, like carbomethoxy- and (trimethylsilyl)tetranitrocubane. Anions from these species are also easily formed and are useful for further substitution on the cubane nucleus. Dinitrogen tetraoxide reacts with the anion of tetranitrocubane to give 1,2,3,5,7-pentanitrocubane, the first cubane to contain vicinal nitro groups. The reaction probably involves oxidation of the anion to the corresponding radical. Similarly, the anion of pentanitrocubane is used to prepare 1,2,3,4,5,7-hexanitrocubane, the most highly nitrated cubane made to date. Single-crystal X-ray structural information is given for both penta- and hexanitrocubane. "
"A model for the structure of the aquated form of cobalt bleomycin (H2O-CoBLM or CoBLM A2 brown), free and bound to d(CCAGGCCTGG)2 (1) is reported based on molecular modeling using the constraints obtained from 2D NMR studies. CoBLM A2 brown has a chiral organization of its ligands, including the axial primary amine of \xce\xb2-aminoalanine, identical to the hydroperoxide form of cobalt BLM (HOO-CoBLM or CoBLM A2 green). H2O-CoBLM forms a 1:1 complex with 1 with a Kd of 2 \xc3\x97 10-6 M which is in slow exchange on the NMR time scale. The complex exhibits 44 intermolecular NOEs and 56 intramolecular NOEs within H2O-CoBLM itself. Molecular modeling reveals that H2O-CoBLM\'s mode of binding, basis for sequence specificity, and chemical specificity are almost identical to that previously reported for HOO-CoBLM (Wu, W.; Vanderwall, D. E.; Turner, C. J.; Kozarich, J. W.; Stubbe, J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 1281\xe2\x88\x921294). The bithiazole tail is inserted from the minor groove 3\xe2\x80\x98 to C6 and the terminal thiazolium ring is well stacked between the bases G14 and G15, while the penultimate thiazolium ring is only partially stacked between the bases of C6 and C7. The basis for sequence specificity involves hydrogen-bonding interactions between the 4-amino group and N3 of the pyrimidine of BLM and the N3 and 2-amino group of G5 of DNA, forming an unusual base triple. Molecular modeling further reveals that the oxygen of the axial H2O ligand is 2.7 \xc3\x85 from the 4\xe2\x80\x98 H of C6, the site of cleavage of iron BLM and light-activated cleavage by HOO-CoBLM. Preliminary studies of H2O-CoBLM with d(CCAGTACTGG) (4) and d(GGAAGCTTCC) (2) are also reported. "
"Upon solution in water, both [hydroxy(mesyloxy)iodo]benzene and [hydroxy(tosyloxy)iodo]benzene undergo complete ionization to give the hydroxy(phenyl)iodonium ion (PhI+OH) and the corresponding sulfonate ion (RSO2O-) as fully solvated species, i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d ions. The phenyliodonium solution species do not form ion pairs with the organosulfonate ions. The hydroxy(phenyl)iodonium ion is presumed to be ligated with at least one water molecule at an apical site of the iodine(III) atom originally occupied by the sulfonate ion. In view of the relative basicities of HO- and H2O, the hydroxy ligand of the [hydroxy(aquo)iodo]benzene ion (PhI+(OH2)OH) is expected to be strongly bound and the water ligand is expected to be weakly bound to the iodine(III) center. This species has a pKA at (4.30 \xc2\xb1 0.05). PhI+(OH2)OH and its conjugate base are present in equilibrium with the [hydroxy(auqo)]-\xce\xbc-oxodiphenyldiiodine cation (Ph(HO)I\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92I+(OH2)Ph). This \xce\xbc-oxo dimer is present at significant levels even in relatively dilute solutions as the combination equilibrium constant is (540 \xc2\xb1 50). This dimer can be protonated, and the pKA of the conjugate acid is \xe2\x89\x882.5. The equilibrium constant for dimerization of [oxo(aquo)iodo]benzene (PhI+(OH2)O-), the most important monomer in acidic solutions, is \xe2\x89\x888.6. "
"Synthetic routes to soluble planar poly(phenylenethiophene)s and polythiophenes are described. The main polymer backbones are synthesized via Pd(0)-catalyzed couplings of the electron-rich N,N\xe2\x80\x98-(bis-tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,4-diamino-2,5-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)thiophene with electron-deficient aryldibromodiones. The prebridged polymers have bathochromically shifted absorptions due to donor/acceptor interactions between the consecutive repeat units. Upon exposure of the polymers to trifluoroacetic acid or titanium tetrachloride, imine bridges are formed that force the consecutive units into planarity. The bridging units are sp2-hybridized, thus allowing for greater electron delocalization between the consecutive aryl units. The syntheses of model trimeric systems were conducted to provide further data for assessing the optical properties of the polymers. Protonation of the imine moieties causes bathochromic shifts of >100 nm in several cases. The effect is explained by an intramolecular charge transfer. Thus these arrangements of planar structures with imine bridges serve as optically based proton sensors with spectral shift differences far-exceeding those of nonplanar imine-containing polymers. "
"The spirocyclic peptidomimetics cyclo-[{(2S,3S)-cyclo-R}GD{(2S,3S)-cyclo-R}GD] (3) and cyclo-[{(2R,3S)-cyclo-R}GD{(2R,3S)-cyclo-R}GD] (4), containing 2,3-methanoarginine (cyclo-Arg\xe2\x80\x98) residues, were prepared. Conformations of these molecules were studied via a combination of CD and 1D and 2D NMR, and these data were interfaced with extensive molecular simulations. Conformational biases for molecules 3 and 4 were thereby deduced and were compared with conclusions previously obtained (Burgess, K.; Lim, D.; Mousa, S. A. J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 4520) for cyclo-[RGDRGD] (2). Molecule 3 has a relatively clear conformational bias toward a structure with a type II \xce\xb2-turn between the Gly CO and Gly NH atoms, but 4 is more flexible, existing in conformers wherein the Asp and Arg side chains tend to be on opposite faces of the backbone cyclic structure. These conclusions were used to interpret the relative affinities of 2\xe2\x88\x924 with respect to the vitronectin receptor. "
"The first total synthesis of the natural product (+)-K252a (2) has been achieved in 12 steps from commercially available materials, with a longest linear sequence of seven steps and an overall yield of 21%. The synthetic strategy employs novel rhodium carbenoid chemistry in the construction of both the indolocarbazole aglycon (4) and the carbohydrate moiety (9). "
"A total synthesis of the natural products (+)-staurosporine (2), (+)-RK286c (3), (\xe2\x88\x92)-TAN-1030a (4), and (+)-MLR-52 (5) has been achieved. The synthetic strategy involves the stereoselective ring expansion of a furanosylated indolocarbazole [(+)-8] to a pyranosylated congener [(+)-12] that serves as a common intermediate in the production of 2\xe2\x88\x925.

"A practical route for the total synthesis of 8,9-secokaurene diterpenes is described. The central step is the [3.3]sigmatropic rearrangement of spirocyclic intermediates such as 35, 40, and 41. All three compounds must necessarily respond identically to properly install the absolute configuration of the bridgehead methine carbon. The total synthesis of (\xe2\x88\x92)-O-methylshikoccin (2b) was realized in 8% overall yield from the Wieland\xe2\x88\x92Miescher ketone 9. Its naturally occurring epoxide 47 was prepared with comparable efficiency. The preparative route developed herein should provide a general entry into this important class of diterpenoids. "
"The stereochemistry of decaethylbiphenyl (5) is analyzed. The potentially low-energy conformers of 5 were generated by formally linking two pentaethylphenyl subunits, and by assuming that no more that one syn interaction is present per ring. Molecular mechanics calculations (MM3 program) indicate that the forms \xe2\x80\x9cf\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9ci\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cj\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cm\xe2\x80\x9d represent the lowest energy conformations. As previously observed for decakis(bromomethyl)biphenyl, the \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d conformation (devoided of any syn arrangement of two neighboring ethyl groups) is destabilized by the mutual steric interactions of ortho ethyl groups at different rings. Decaethylbiphenyl (5) was synthesized by exhaustive ethylation of biphenyl. The compound exists in the crystal in three different conformations (\xe2\x80\x9ci\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cj\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cm\xe2\x80\x9d). Low-temperature 13C NMR data show that the compound exists in CDCl2F at 149 K in two conformations in a 4:1 ratio, and the major conformer was assigned to the \xe2\x80\x9cm\xe2\x80\x9d form. Dynamic NMR data indicate that \xe2\x80\x9cm\xe2\x80\x9d undergoes ethyl rotation with a barrier of \xce\x94G176\xe2\x80\xa1 = 8.2 \xc2\xb1 0.1 kcal mol-1. The interconversion graph of 5 was analyzed, and on the basis of the MM calculations and NMR data, it is concluded that the rotational process followed by NMR involves the stepwise rotation of the meta and para ethyl groups of \xe2\x80\x9cm\xe2\x80\x9d.

"The yttrium hydride dimer (Cp*2YH)2 (2) reacted rapidly with 3,3-dimethyl-1,4-pentadiene in methylcyclohexane-d14 at \xe2\x88\x9278 \xc2\xb0C to form the d0 yttrium(III) pentenyl chelate complex Cp*2Y[\xce\xb71,\xce\xb72-CH2CH2C(CH3)2CHCH2] (4). Low-temperature 1H, 13C, and 1H NOESY NMR spectroscopy of 4 established bonding of the tethered alkene to the d0 metal center. Quantitative analysis of the NOESY time course using the Conformer Population Analysis method demonstrates that the dominant conformers in solution are interconverting pairs of chelated complexes, one in a twist-boat conformation and the other a chair conformer. No significant contribution by a free alkene conformation is required to explain the spectroscopic data. Addition of THF to pentenyl chelate 4 at \xe2\x88\x9278 \xc2\xb0C displaced the alkene and formed the yttrium(III) pentenyl THF adduct Cp*2Y[\xce\xb71-CH2CH2C(CH3)2CHCH2](THF) (5), in which there is no interaction between the pendant alkene and the d0 metal center. Yttrium hydride dimer 2 also reacted with either 1,4-pentadiene or methylenecyclobutane to form the same pentenyl chelate complex Cp*2Y[\xce\xb71,\xce\xb72-CH2CH2CH2CHCH2] (6). The interconversion of deuterium-labeled chelate complexes 6-1,1,5,5-d4 and 6-3,3,5,5-d4 at \xe2\x88\x9278 \xc2\xb0C (\xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 14.4 \xc2\xb1 0.2 kcal mol-1) establishes that intramolecular alkene insertion is occurring under the reaction conditions.

"The hexahydrido complex OsH6(PiPr3)2 (1) reacts with tetrafluorobenzobarrelene (TFB), 2,5-norbornadiene (NBD), and 1,3-cyclohexadiene to afford OsH2(\xce\xb74-TFB)(PiPr3)2 (2), OsH2(\xce\xb74-NBD)(PiPr3)2 (3), and OsH2(\xce\xb74-cyclohexadiene)(PiPr3)2 (4), respectively. The protonation of 2 and 3 with HBF4 yields [OsH3(\xce\xb74-TFB)(PiPr3)2]BF4 (5) and [OsH3(\xce\xb74-NBD)(PiPr3)2]BF4 (6). The 1H NMR spectra of 5 and 6 in the hydrido region at low temperature display AM2X2 spin systems (X = 31P), which are simplified to AM2 spin systems in the 1H{31P} spectra. The values for JAM are temperature dependent, increasing from 13.1 to 35.9 Hz (5) and from 11.0 to 17.7 Hz (6) as temperature is increased from 190 to 230 K and from 180 to 240 K, respectively. The reaction of 4 with HBF4 leads to the cyclohexenyl complex [OsH2(\xce\xb73-C6H9)(PiPr3)2]BF4 (7), which shows an agostic interaction between the osmium center and one of the two endo-CH bonds adjacent to the \xcf\x80-allyl unit. In solution complex 7 is fluxional. The fluxional process involves the exchange between the relative positions of the hydrido ligands and the endo-CH hydrogen atoms of the cyclohexenyl ligand and, at the same time, the exchange between the CH allyl and the exo-CH hydrogen atoms inside the cyclohexenyl ligand. The structure of 7 in the solid state has been determined by X-ray diffraction. The distribution of ligands around the osmium atom can be described as a piano stool geometry with the agostic hydrogen atom and the midpoints of the carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon bonds involved in the \xcf\x80-allyl unit forming the three-membered face, while both the hydrido and phosphine ligands lie in the four-membered face.

"The olefin complexes Cp*2M(CH2CH(R))(H) (R = H (1), CH3 (2); M = Nb (a), Ta (b)) react cleanly with catecholborane (HBCat) and HBO2C6H3-4-tBu (HBCat\xe2\x80\x98) to give Cp*2M(H2BCat) (M = Nb (5a), Ta (5b)) and Cp*2M(H2BCat\xe2\x80\x98) (M = Nb (6a), Ta (6b)) and the anti-Markovnikov hydroboration products CatBCH2CH2R and Cat\xe2\x80\x98BCH2CH2R. Compounds 2a and 2b react with DBCat\xe2\x80\x98 (DBO2C6H3-4-tBu) to afford the deuterated analogs Cp*2M(D2BCat\xe2\x80\x98) (M = Nb (6a), Ta (6b)) where the deuterium label is incorporated exclusively in the metal complex. The hydride resonances in 6a exhibit large perturbations in chemical shift when deuterium is incorporated. On the basis of this isotopic labeling experiment, a mechanism is proposed where HBCat reacts with the 16-electron alkyl intermediates, Cp*2MCH2CH2R (R = H (3), Me (4)), via \xcf\x83-bond metathesis or oxidative-addition/reductive-elimination sequences, to generate the alkylboranes and an intermediate hydride, Cp*2MH, that is trapped by additional borane to give Cp*2M(H2BCat) (5a and 5b). The solid-state structures for Cp*2Nb(\xce\xb72-H2BO2C6H3-3-tBu) (16) and Cp2*Nb(\xce\xb72-BH4) (17) were determined by X-ray diffraction. The metal\xe2\x88\x92boron distances in these two compounds are identical within experimental error. While related group 5 catecholateboryl compounds have pronounced boryl character, the structural parameters for the hydride and boryl ligands in 16 are consistent with formulation as either a borohydride complex or a borane adduct of \xe2\x80\x9cCp*2NbH\xe2\x80\x9d. In contrast to other group 5 boryl complexes, 6a reacts readily with various two-electron ligands with elimination of HBCat\xe2\x80\x98. For example, H2 reacts reversibly to form Cp*2NbH3 and HBCat\xe2\x80\x98, while \xe2\x80\x9cBH3\xe2\x80\x9d and CO react irreversibly to yield Cp*Nb(BH4) and Cp*2Nb(H)(CO) with elimination of HBCat\xe2\x80\x98, respectively. Ethylene and propylene react at 40 \xc2\xb0C to regenerate 1a and 2a, with elimination of HBCat\xe2\x80\x98. When excess olefin is present, the liberated borane is converted to CatBCH2CH2R. Solutions of 1a and 2a catalyze olefin hydroboration under mild conditions. Relationships between the reactivity of 1a and 2a and other early metal and lanthanide catalysts are discussed. "
"The present report deals with the multistep migratory insertion of carbon monoxide and isocyanides into the metal\xe2\x88\x92carbon bonds of the ZrR2 fragment anchored to a tetroxo matrix, defined by the dimethoxycalix[4]arene dianion [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2]2-. The relevant differences between the two fragments [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2Zr]2+ and [Cp2Zr]2+ are experimentally proven and theoretically interpreted. Unlike those for [Cp2Zr]2+ derivatives, the reaction of CO with [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2ZrR2] [R = Me, 1; CH2Ph, 2; p-MeC6H4, 3] proceeds via a two-step migration directly to the  (R = Me, 4; CH2Ph, 5; p-MeC6H4, 6). The Zr\xe2\x88\x92C functionality in 4\xe2\x88\x926 maintains its inserting capability in the reaction with ketones, i.e., Ph2CO, leading to the diolate derivative [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2Zr{OC(R2)C(Ph2)O}] (8, R = p-MeC6H4), or with ButNC, forming [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2Zr{OC(Me2)C(CNBut)N(But)}] (7). The reaction of 1\xe2\x88\x923 with ButNC proceeds through two different pathways, depending on the temperature and the R substituent at the metal. The first one leads to the \xce\xb72-metal-bonded imine [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2Zr{\xce\xb72-N(But)C(R2)}] [ R = Me, 12; CH2Ph, 13], which inserts two additional molecules of ButNC to give a metalladiazacyclopentane, [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2Zr{N(But)C(Me2)C(CNBut)N(But)}] (14). The second pathway led, at low temperature, to the bis-\xce\xb72-iminoacyls [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2Zr{\xce\xb72-N(But)C(R)}2] [R = Me, 15; p-MeC6H4, 16], which at 60 \xc2\xb0C couple to the corresponding enediamido ligand in [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2Zr{N(But)C(R)C(R)N(But)}] [R = Me, 17; p-MeC6H4, 18]. The coupling of 15 and 16 showed first order kinetics in both cases and allowed the calculation of the corresponding activation parameters. The most significant differences between [p-But-calix[4]-(OMe)2(O)2Zr]2+ and [Cp2Zr]2+ have been interpreted on the basis of the frontier orbital sets of the two fragments. "
"Irradiation of [bis(diisopropylamino)phosphino](trimethylsilyl)diazomethane at 254 nm in the presence of tert-butylphosphaalkyne leads to 1\xcf\x834,2\xcf\x832-diphosphete 1 in 90% yield. Derivative 1 reacts with Fe2(CO)9 and W(CO)5(THF) giving rise to the corresponding \xce\xb71-complexes 2 (48% yield) and 3 (75% yield), respectively. When 1 equiv of methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and elemental selenium is added to derivative 1, the cationic and neutral 1\xcf\x834,2\xcf\x833-diphosphetes 4 and 5 are isolated in 95 and 66% yields, respectively. Addition of 2 equiv of elemental selenium and bis(trimethylsilyl)peroxide to diphosphete 1 gave rise to 1\xcf\x834,2\xcf\x834-diphosphetes 6 (43% yield) and 7 (84% yield), respectively. \xce\xb71-(1\xcf\x834,2\xcf\x832-Diphosphete)tungsten complex 3 reacted with bis(trimethylsilyl)peroxide affording heterocyclic complex 8 (68% yield). Addition of 1 equiv of tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone (TCBQ) to the cationic 1\xcf\x834,2\xcf\x833-diphosphete 4 and of 2 equiv to the 1\xcf\x834,2\xcf\x832-diphosphete 1 affords the 1\xcf\x834,2\xcf\x835- and 1\xcf\x834,2\xcf\x836-diphosphetes 9 (86% yield) and 10 (92% yield), respectively. Addition of TCBQ to the \xce\xb71-(1\xcf\x834,2\xcf\x832-diphosphete)tungsten complex 3 affords the \xce\xb71-(1\xcf\x834,2\xcf\x834-diphosphete)complex 11 (88% yield), which reacts with 2 equiv of trimethylphosphine leading to the zwitterionic 1\xcf\x834,2\xcf\x833-diphosphete 12 (46% yield). Cleavage of the Si\xe2\x88\x92C bond of complex 3 with 1 equiv of tetrabutylammonium fluoride hydrate gives \xce\xb71-(1\xcf\x834,2\xcf\x832-diphosphete)complex 13 (61% yield), which reacts with TCBQ leading to the cis-1,2-diphosphino alkene complex 14 (77% yield). These results demonstrate that the unsaturated four-membered ring skeleton is a remarkable template for inducing unusual P\xe2\x88\x92P interactions. However, the presence of two very bulky substituents on the ethylenic moiety is necessary for the persistence of the cyclic structure, when the two phosphorus atoms feature a high coordination state. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of derivatives 7 and 11\xe2\x88\x9214 have been carried out. "
"The 7Fe ferredoxin from Desulfovibrio africanus contains a reactive 3Fe cluster which incorporates Fe and other metals to form cubanes [M3Fe-4S] having non-cysteine ligation to the added metal (M). These reactions are addressed at controlled potentials in protein molecules adsorbed on a graphite electrode, thereby facilitating an appraisal of factors that control cluster interconversions. Electrochemical and spectroscopic methods have been used to establish connectivities among interconversions with different M, explore the influence of pH, and determine reactivities of specific cluster oxidation levels. Formation of clusters with M = Fe, Zn, and Co depends on ionization of a group with pK = 5.5 + 0.3, thus supporting congruence among products and suggesting common involvement of aspartate-14 which replaces a cysteine normally present in [4Fe-4S] binding motifs. The influence of potential is complex:\xe2\x80\x89 rapid and reversible interconversion (M = Fe, Zn) occurs only between the states [M3Fe-4S]2+ and [3Fe-4S]0, with [3Fe-4S]1+ having little affinity for M. The [M3Fe-4S]1+ cubanes and hyperreduced [3Fe-4S]2- are relatively unreactive. Uptake and release are significantly more rapid for M = Zn compared to Fe. Among potentially intrusive metals, Pb has a particularly high affinity for the [3Fe-4S] cluster, but the product undergoes subsequent irreversible reactions. The studies provide complementary perspectives on factors influencing cluster stability or reactivity and on the feasibility and consequences of metal substitutions. "
"The decomposition of aqueous ammonium nitrate at elevated temperatures and pressures is examined as a function of chloride, nitrate, and total acidity. Catalysis requiring both chloride and acid was observed in solutions containing 20% (w/w) NH4NO3 at 180 \xc2\xb0C. Nitrous oxide and dinitrogen were generated in a 4:1 ratio below 0.2 M H+. Dinitrogen formation correlated with the production of additional acidity by the reaction 5NH4NO3 \xe2\x86\x92 4N2 + 2HNO3 + 9H2O. The second-order dependence of the decomposition reaction on [H+] is consistent with the reversible formation of NO2+. Incorporation of 18O into the N2O product, as well as the inverse deuterium isotope effect, supports this conclusion. A novel mechanism based on the intermediacy of NO2Cl is proposed for the chloride catalysis and contrasted to the radical-based pathways operational in molten NH4NO3 decompositions. Isotope-labeling experiments using 15NH4NO3 lead to the formation of 15NNO-labeled nitrous oxide and the dinitrogen products 15N\xe2\x8b\xae15N and N\xe2\x8b\xae15N in a 1:3 ratio. Decomposition of NH415NO3 produces only N15NO and N\xe2\x8b\xae15N. This agrees with the reaction sequences:\xe2\x80\x89 NO2Cl + NH4+ \xe2\x86\x92 {O2N\xe2\x88\x92NH3}+ + H+ + Cl-, {O2N\xe2\x88\x92NH3}+ \xe2\x86\x92 N2O + H3O+ and 3NO2Cl + 3NH3 \xe2\x86\x92 3NH2Cl + 3NO2- + 3H+, 3NH2Cl \xe2\x86\x92 N2 + NH4+ + 3Cl- + 2H+, 3NO2- + 3NH4+ \xe2\x86\x92 3N2 + 6H2O. These results bear on the industrial preparation of NH4NO3 and suggest conditions under which nitrous oxide emissions might be important to the global N2O budget. "
"The tris(tert-butoxy)siloxy complexes M[OSi(OtBu)3]4 (1, M = Zr and 2, M = Hf) are efficient single-source precursors to homogeneous zirconia-silica and hafnia-silica materials. The ceramic conversions occur pyrolytically at low temperatures, give the theoretical yield for MO2\xc2\xb74SiO2 compositions, and occur without the incorporation of carbon. Compounds 1 and 2 are isomorphous, and crystallize as a mixture of two isomers. One isomer contains a 4-coordinate metal center, while the other is 5-coordinate and features a chelating \xce\xb72-OSi(OtBu)3 ligand. The solid-state transformation of 1 to ZrO2\xc2\xb74SiO2 produces an open, fibrous material that is somewhat ordered with pores which are \xe2\x88\xbc20 nm in diameter. The solution-phase thermolysis of 1 produces a xerogel composed of small primary particles (\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xbc5 nm). This xerogel possesses a high surface area (700 m2 g-1 for samples heated to 200 \xc2\xb0C). Solutions of the precursors have been used to cast crack-free thin films of MO2\xc2\xb74SiO2. The MO2\xc2\xb74SiO2 materials are amorphous as initially formed, and subsequent crystallizations of tetragonal ZrO2, monoclinic ZrO2, and cristobalite occur at relatively high temperatures. The enhanced stabilization of the amorphous and tetragonal phases of zirconia, relative to those derived from many sol-gel systems, implies that these single-source precursors initially produce homogeneous materials and that subsequent crystallizations are to a large degree diffusion-controlled. Homogeneity in the initially formed ZrO2\xc2\xb74SiO2 material is also suggested by solid-state 29Si NMR spectra. The molecular route to oxide materials described here represents an alternative to the sol-gel method and may offer certain advantages. "
"This article contains (i) an experimental EPR study on [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]3+ and [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]+ centers in single crystals of a model compound having an asymmetrical cubane-type cluster and (ii) a theoretical model for the interpretation of g-tensors of such states found in synthetic compounds and protein active sites. In the first part, an extensive EPR study of a large number of paramagnetic species with S = 1/2 in \xce\xb3-irradiated single crystals of the (Et4N)2[Fe4S4(SC6H4-o-OH)4] compound (a model complex of active sites of [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S] proteins) is reported. This compound represents a simple case of asymmetric 4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S cluster being well characterized in the crystalline solid state:\xe2\x80\x89 three iron atoms have the usual tetrahedral coordination with four sulfur atoms, while the fourth one has an extra coordination to the oxygen of the phenol group of its thiolate ligand. Thus, with respect to the local symmetry of its cubane cluster, this compound constitutes formally a representative model of asymmetric active sites, here introduced through the extra pentacoordination. The g-tensors of the different paramagnetic species created in (Et4N)2[Fe4S4(SC6H4-o-OH)4] single crystals could be deduced from the angular dependences of the EPR lines in three perpendicular planes. Three different [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]3+ centers (with gav > 2.0023 and relatively axial g-tensors) as well as eight [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]+ centers (with gav \xe2\x89\xa4 2.0023 andmost oftenrhombic g-tensors) were identified. These different species exhibit a large variety of principal values. In the second part, a general model is proposed for the interpretation of the principal values and the principal directions of the g-tensors of [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]3+ and [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]+ centers. It is based on simple qualitative arguments, which are, at first, developed for symmetric compounds of C2v electronic structure. This model allows us to rationalize most of our previous results obtained for single crystals of the (Et4N)2[Fe4S4(SCH2Ph)4] compound as well as most of those presented here. This explains the relation existing between the location of the mixed-valence pair in the cubane cluster and the principal direction V1 corresponding to the largest principal value, g1, of the g-tensor. It is also shown that the two other eigenvalues of the g-tensor, g2 and g3, are expected to have their corresponding principal directions V2 and V3 aligned with the two pairs of identical iron ions. Moreover, in the [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]+ state, the existence of two nearly degenerate orbital configurations, called OC1 and OC2, has to be taken into account. Thereafter follows a qualitative discussion of the effects on the g-tensors, in the different cases, produced by the introduction of some asymmetry. Finally, this analysis allows us to understand the reasons leading to the number and the diversity of paramagnetic centers observed here and to propose a plausible set of localizations for almost all of them. It also confirms, for the case of the [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]3+ states, that taking into account the principal direction V1 is a valuable tool, a useful \xe2\x80\x9crule of thumb\xe2\x80\x9d for the determination of the position of the mixed-valence pair, despite the fact that we deal here with asymmetric compounds. This conclusion is to be contrasted to what can be deduced for the [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]+ states because of the greater sensitivity of the ferrous ions, the main source of g-anisotropy, to their immediate surrounding. In this last case, we think that such a correlation still makes good sense for a (nearly) symmetric arrangement in which the two ferrous ions are (nearly) equivalent. However, breaking significantly this mirror-type symmetry within the ferrous pair can lead to unpredictable g-tensor axes. "
"Proton ENDOR spectroscopy on \xce\xb3-irradiated single crystals of the synthetic model compound (Et4N)2[Fe4S4(SC6H4-o-OH)4] has been used to study a [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S]+ center that has properties similar to those of the reduced states of some particular ferredoxins and of the enzyme aconitase. The interesting point about this model compound is that one iron atom is five-coordinate, with an extra phenolic oxygen attached to one of its thiolate ligand. The complex thus represents an example of an asymmetrical [4Fe\xe2\x88\x924S] cluster in the solid crystalline state. From the study of the angular dependence of the proton ENDOR lines, it has been possible to derive eight hyperfine tensors of protons occupying different positions in the near vicinity of the iron atoms, the main bearers of the spin population of the paramagnetic anion. Some protons belong to thiolate ligands of the anion whereas others belong to close (Et4N)+ counterions. From the anisotropic parts of the tensorsand by using a multicentric point-dipole modelit has been possible to derive the distribution of the unpaired electron spin population on the different iron (and sulfur) atoms of the cluster. The spin populations thus obtained indicate that two iron atoms (Fe2 and Fe3) constitute a localized Fe3+\xe2\x88\x92Fe2+ mixed-valence pair. Within the limitations of a pairwise vectorial spin coupling model that considers two iron pairs, these results show that the magnetic ground state of the center studied here most probably corresponds to a |9/2,4,1/2\xe3\x80\x89 spin state, where 9/2, 4, and 1/2 are the spin quantum numbers of the mixed-valence pair, the ferrous pair, and the cluster, respectively. Finally, it is found that the spin populations on the different iron atoms, obtained for this model system, are quite similar to those of reduced substrate-free aconitase derivable from previous M\xc3\xb6ssbauer and ENDOR measurements.

"A variable-temperature 1H NMR study on \xce\xb2- and \xce\xb1-d-glycero-pent-2\xe2\x80\x98-enopyranosyl nucleosides 1\xe2\x88\x9210 has shown that the constituent pyranosyl moiety is involved in a rapid two-state 6H5 \xe2\x87\x84 5E/5S4 conformational equilibrium. The results of the conformational analysis of 3JHH coupling constants were compared with the trends of X-ray crystallography and ab initio calculations, which support the two-state dynamic equilibrium and suggest that the equilibrium is affected by the nature of the heterocyclic aglycon. The \xce\xb2 nucleosides 1\xe2\x88\x925 adopt predominantly (approximately 95% in purine and 80% in pyrimidine nucleosides at 298 K) the conformation that is intermediate between the 5E and 5S4 canonical forms, where both the nucleobase and 4\xe2\x80\x98-OH are in the axial orientation. The pyranosyl moiety of \xce\xb1-purine nucleosides 6 and 7 is involved in an unbiased two-state conformational equilibrium. On the other hand, the \xce\xb1-pyrimidine nucleosides 8\xe2\x88\x9210 show a conformational bias of ca. 75% toward 5E canonical form. The van\'t Hoff type analysis of the changes in the conformational equilibrium with temperature afforded thermodynamic data on 6H5 \xe2\x87\x84 5E/5S4 conformational equilibrium in 1\xe2\x88\x9210. The comparative analysis of \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 has shown that 6H5 \xe2\x87\x84 5E/5S4 conformational equilibrium in 1\xe2\x88\x9210 is driven by the fine tuning of O6\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92C1\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92N1/9 anomeric effect, the gauche effect of the [O6\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92C5\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92C4\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92O4\xe2\x80\x98] fragment, the interaction between \xcf\x80-system of the C2\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92C3\xe2\x80\x98 bond with the heterocyclic aglycon and 4\xe2\x80\x98-OH in the allylic position, and the intrinsic steric effect. Dissection of the individual contributions to the drive of conformational equilibrium of 1\xe2\x88\x9210 has shown that the relative strength of \xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x83*C1\xe2\x80\x98-N1/9 interactions in purine vs pyrimidine nucleobases increases in the following order:\xe2\x80\x89 cytosine < uracil < thymine < adenine < guanine.

"13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of the free acid of phenoxymethyl penicillin (penicillin V) and of its lithium, sodium, rubidium, and cesium salts (C16H17N2O5SM, M = H, Li\xc2\xb7H2O, Na, Rb, and Cs) have been studied at a range of temperatures between 180 and 400 K. The 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra at ambient temperature indicate that the structures have one, two, one, four, and one molecule(s), respectively, in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. This is confirmed by the known crystal structure of the free acid and the single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies reported here of the various salts. The variable-temperature 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra indicate that the phenyl rings of all the molecules perform 180\xc2\xb0 flips about their local C2 axes, with measured or extrapolated rate constants in the range 5 \xc3\x97 10-12 to 8 \xc3\x97 109 s-1 in the temperature regime 200\xe2\x88\x92380 K, and spanning 11 orders of magnitude at ambient temperature. The atomic displacement parameters of the X-ray structural model suggest that these rings also undergo significant in-plane librations. The Arrhenius activation parameters for the ring flip motions have been determined, by analysis of exchange and dipolar broadened NMR line shapes and with 1-D (and 2-D) magnetization transfer experiments, for the free acid and all four salts. The activation barriers have been interpreted in terms of the degree of entrapment of the phenyl groups and the nature of the packing interactions in the different crystal structures. "
"This paper presents data on the 15N chemical shift tensor principal values in a series of 15N-enriched heterocycles. Compounds that are liquids at room temperature were frozen, and the principal values of all compounds studied were measured from static powder patterns. Four different types of nitrogen tensors are described, consisting of protonated and nonprotonated nitrogens in both five- and six-membered rings. The principal values were oriented on the molecular frame using the DFT quantum mechanical calculations of the 15N chemical shielding tensors. The agreement between the calculated and experimental principal values is adequate to make these assignments, but the relative scatters are greater than those observed in similar 13C chemical shift calculations. The largest shift component, \xce\xb411, is always oriented in the radial direction to the ring for substituted nitrogens but is tangential to the ring for the nonsubstituted nitrogens. The large variations observed in the nitrogen chemical shift tensors upon changing the nitrogen hybridization can be explained using qualitative arguments on the localization of the smallest bonding-antibonding or HOMO\xe2\x88\x92LUMO gap in the molecule. The orientation of the largest shift component is always found in the plane of the molecule and is approximately perpendicular to the plane containing the bonding\xe2\x88\x92antibonding or HOMO\xe2\x88\x92LUMO pair of orbitals with the smallest energy gap.

"It was found that perfluoropolyethers (PFPE) with carboxylic acid end groups, PFPE-COOH, and their sodium salts, PFPE-COONa, afford an anhydrous fluid medium in which the direct pair-wise interaction of these end groups may be examined. An IR study (of the carbonyl band) of these materials revealed not only the dimerization of acid units, but also the formation of salt dimers, (salt)2, and mixed dimers, (acid)(salt). The carbonyl spectra of PFPE-acid/salt mixtures exhibit temperature-dependent broadening, shift, and, in some cases, coalescence of the bands which are attributed to the pseudocoalescence phenomenon stemming from the presence of relatively low energy cation exchange passages among the three possible dimers. Examination of the corresponding CH3COOH/CH3COONa system by ab initio calculations (6-31G) yielded the heat of dimerization of \xe2\x88\xbc20, \xe2\x88\xbc50, and \xe2\x88\xbc35 kcal/mol for the acid\xe2\x88\x92acid, the salt\xe2\x88\x92salt, and the acid\xe2\x88\x92salt dimers, respectively. The calculated dimer structures are shown and discussed. The calculations also yielded the carbonyl stretching frequencies in good accord, and in support of the analyses/postulates made for the PFPE-acid/salt system. "
"We report CW and pulsed Q-band 1,2H ENDOR measurements of intermediate X formed during the assembly of the diferric tyrosyl radical cofactor of the R2 subunit in ribonucleotide reductase. These studies, performed with H2O and D2O buffers, were designed to determine whether the exchangeable proton signals are associated with an hydroxo bridge, a terminal water, or both. In doing so, we identify the types of protonated oxygen (OHx) species coordinated to the iron ions of X and their disposition relative to the ferric and ferryl iron ions. The exchangeable proton signals displayed by intermediate X belong to two protons associated with a terminal water bound to Fe,III and not to an hydroxo bridge; within the precision of the modeling, this picture of a terminal water is indistinguishable from that of a 2-fold disordered terminal hydroxyl. The fact that X displays strong spin-coupling between iron ions requires that there be one or more oxo/hydroxo bridges. These findings then establish that X contains the [(HxO)FeIIIOFeIV] fragment.

"In solution, the degree of molecular alignment with the static magnetic field is proportional to the product of the anisotropy of the molecular magnetic susceptibility and the square of the magnetic field strength. As a result, the observed chemical shifts vary with the strength of the magnetic field and depend on the orientation of the chemical shift tensors relative to the molecule\'s magnetic susceptibility tensor. For protein backbone amide 15N nuclei in the complex between the zinc-finger DNA-binding domain of GATA-1 and a 16-bp synthetic DNA fragment, the observed field dependence of the 15N shifts correlates well with the dipolar couplings previously reported for this complex. This comparison indicates that, in the approximation of an axially symmetric 15N shift tensor, the unique axis of the 15N CSA tensor makes an angle of 13 \xc2\xb1 5\xc2\xb0 with the N\xe2\x88\x92H bond vector, and has a magnitude of 168 \xc2\xb1 20 ppm. Magnetic field dependent 15N chemical shifts correlate well with the structure of the protein\xe2\x88\x92DNA complex refined with 1H\xe2\x88\x9215N and 13C\xce\xb1\xe2\x88\x921H\xce\xb1 dipolar coupling constraints, but poorly with the original structure of this complex, despite relatively small rms differences between the two ensembles of structures. Magnetic field dependent chemical shifts therefore are potentially quite useful as constraints in macromolecular structure determination. "
"High level ab initio theory is used to investigate the effects of the neutral bases HF, H2O, and NH3 on the mechanisms and barriers for isomerization of the conventional radical cations CH3X\xe2\x80\xa2+ (X = F, OH, and NH2) to their corresponding distonic isomers \xe2\x80\xa2CH2X+H. It is found that the isomerization mechanism is determined largely by the relative proton affinities of the base and the parent radical \xe2\x80\xa2CH2X. If the proton affinity of the base is substantially lower than the proton affinity at either C or X of \xe2\x80\xa2CH2X, the barrier is lowered but remains positive relative to separated base plus CH3X\xe2\x80\xa2+. If the proton affinity of the base lies between that at C and X, the barrier becomes negative and the base successfully catalyzes the isomerization of CH3X\xe2\x80\xa2+ to \xe2\x80\xa2CH2X+H. In fact, the barrier is found to be negative even in cases where the proton affinity of the base is lower than the lower proton affinity site of \xe2\x80\xa2CH2X, provided that this proton affinity difference is not too large. If the proton affinity of the base is higher than that at both C and X, the barrier to rearrangement is lowered even further. However, intermolecular proton transfer from the ion to the base rather than intramolecular proton migration is then the lower energy process. An alternative isomerization mechanism for the [CH3OH/base]\xe2\x80\xa2+ systems is also detailed in which the base remains bound to the hydroxyl hydrogen throughout. The barriers for this so-called \xe2\x80\x9cspectator\xe2\x80\x9d mechanism are found to be higher than those for the interconversion of the isolated conventional and distonic ions. A rationalization based on the nature of the intervening ion\xe2\x88\x92base complexes is presented. "
"A study on a modeled version of the complex [Ru(H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7H)(C5Me5)(dppm)]+ has been performed both at electronic structure level and including quantum treatment of nuclei. Density functional theory (DFT) electronic structure calculations alone fail to reproduce the experimentally reported geometry of the elongated dihydrogen ligand of the complex, even though the rest of the complex is satisfactorily described. Quantum nuclear motion calculations manage to correctly explain the geometries found experimentally by means of neutron diffraction measurements. Isotopic effects are predicted for the hydrogen\xe2\x88\x92hydrogen distance of the elongated dihydrogen ligand depending on its isotopic composition. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the J(H,D) coupling constant is also interpreted successfully on the grounds of varying population of the vibrational excited states of the Ru\xe2\x88\x92H2 unit.

"Ferric aquo heme complexes comprise the active site of three major families of heme proteins, the peroxidases, the cytochrome P450s, and metmyoglobin. There is ample evidence from a variety of spectroscopic studies of wild type (wt) and mutant enzymes that in these resting state complexes, the sextet, quartet, and doublet states are very close in energy and the predominant spin state observed is a sensitive function of the number, nature, and geometry of the axial ligands. One correlation that is very difficult to determine experimentally is the relationship between spin state and geometry in the same heme complex. This coupling of geometry and spin state in the same complex can be functionally important since spin state changes are often a key part of function, for example, in the enzymatic cycle of the cytochrome P450s. To further explore the relationship between geometry and spin state, we report here for the first time the use of ab initio methods to calculate optimized geometries and electronic structure of a model for the resting state of peroxidases in its sextet, quartet, and doublet states. The sextet state is found to be the lowest energy state in agreement with experimental results reported for a model diaquo heme compound. Although a longer Fe\xe2\x88\x92water distance was obtained in the model compound, the unique feature of these calculations is their ability to monitor changes in geometry in the various spin states in the same complex. While the optimized quartet geometry is similar to the sextet geometry, the doublet state has a considerably shorter Fe\xe2\x88\x92water distance. These results suggest that the environment of the protein can modulate spin state changes by imposing geometric changes in this mobile Fe\xe2\x88\x92ligand interaction by interaction from both the proximal and distal sides. Experimental determination of spin state populations by a number of spectroscopic methods in wt and mutants of the Fe(III) resting form of cytochrome-C peroxidases (CCP) with known Fe\xe2\x88\x92water distances from crystal structures provide strong support for this hypothesis.

"The ene reactions of triazolinedione (TAD) with propene, trans- and cis-butene, and tetramethylethylene (TME) have been investigated theoretically with ab initio molecular orbital calculations. All geometries were fully optimized at the RHF/6-31G* level, followed by MP2/6-31G* and Becke3LYP/6-31G* single point energy calculations. A stepwise mechanism involving an aziridinium imide (AI) intermediate is predicted. The most stable transition structure for the first step involves a decidedly non-least-motion attack of TAD on the alkene, with methyl group rotation to bring a hydrogen in close proximity to the nitrogen on TAD for favorable electrostatic and secondary orbital interactions. Some isomerization of the AI intermediates is feasible, while reversion to reactants is less favorable than the product-forming hydrogen transfer. The activation energies decrease in the series from propene, to butenes, to TME, as the alkenes become more substituted and electron-rich. Kinetic isotope effects were computed based on the RHF/6-31G* geometries and frequencies, using the Bigeleisen\xe2\x88\x92Mayer equation and the QUIVER program. The calculated isotope effects are in reasonable accord with the experimental measurements. The stabilizing N--H interaction in the first transition structure contributes significantly to the observed isotope effect. "
"\xce\xb3-Alumina surfaces dehydrated at 450 and 700 \xc2\xb0C were studied by using the conventional pyridine adsorption-DRFTIR technique. Three types of Lewis acid sites are present on the surface, and in each case pyridine adsorbed on them is concomitantly interacting with their adjacent OH groups. Because only three types of Lewis acid sites are present, only three hydrogen bonding bands were observed upon pyridine adsorption. From correlation of OH bands with hydrogen bonding bands, it is found that weak Lewis acid sites have type II66 or II64 OH groups as their neighbors, medium strong Lewis acid sites have type III OH groups near by, and strong Lewis acid sites have type I6 OH groups next to them. Dehydration at 700 \xc2\xb0C generates more types of OH groups that also interact with pyridine. The reactivity of OH groups is not determined by their acidity and space restrictions, but rather by their proximity to Lewis acid sites. We assigned the three types of Lewis acid sites to five-, four-, and three-coordinate Al3+ ions. "
"Long-range photoinduced electron transfer has been systematically examined in a series of small DNA duplexes covalently modified with ethidium and Rh(phi)2bpy3+ through time-resolved and steady-state measurements of fluorescence quenching. Fast fluorescence quenching (k \xe2\x89\xb3 1010 s-1) is observed for this donor/acceptor pair noncovalently bound to DNA, and transient absorption studies allow the assignment of this quenching to an electron-transfer mechanism. In the duplexes modified with tethered intercalators, intrahelix fluorescence quenching attributed to electron transfer occurs at distances up to 30 \xc3\x85. Over a donor/acceptor separation of \xe2\x88\xbc20 \xc3\x85, approximately 30% of the ethidium fluorescence is quenched, while at a separation of \xe2\x88\xbc30 \xc3\x85, approximately 10% quenching is observed. Time-resolved measurements indicate that this quenching is primarily static. Fluorescence polarization and melting studies indicate that the intercalators are rigidly bound, enhance helix stability, and the duplex populations are structurally homogeneous. The distance dependence of the quenching yield observed in these duplexes is shallow, but the quenching reaction is highly sensitive to stacking perturbations. Changes in the quenching yield with melting are directly correlated with hypochromicity associated with base stacking. Moreover, in duplexes containing a highly disruptive CA mismatch, large decreases in the quenching efficiency are observed, while with a well-stacked GA mismatch, electron transfer proceeds efficiently. Hence, in these covalently-modified assemblies, DNA-mediated electron transfer is found to depend only weakly on donor/acceptor separation, when compared to protein systems, but is highly sensitive to perturbations in base stacking.

"Spiroannelated methanofullerenes bearing quinone-type addends including TCNQ and DCNQI analogues (3a\xe2\x88\x92c, 6a,b, 8, 10, and 11) have been prepared, and their structural and electronic properties have been characterized by both experimental techniques and quantum-chemical calculations. The spiro[2,5-cyclohexadienone-4,61\xe2\x80\x98-methanofullerene] derivatives (3a\xe2\x88\x92c), the spiro[10-anthrone-9,61\xe2\x80\x98-methanofullerene] (8), and the TCNQ- and DCNQI-type derivatives (10 and 11) were isolated as [6,6] adducts. The spiro[cyclohexanone-4,61\xe2\x80\x98-methanofullerene] (6) was however obtained as a mixture of [5,6] and [6,6] isomers. The novel methanofullerenes, with the only exception of 6, show irreversible cyclic voltammograms with additional reduction peaks. The conjugated cyclohexadienone derivatives 3 exhibit better acceptor abilities than the parent C60. Semiempirical PM3 calculations show that the addend lies perpendicular to the transanular bond in 3, while it folds down and adopts a butterfly shaped structure for compounds 8, 10, and 11. For compounds 3, periconjugative interactions transmit the inductive effect of the addend and produce a small stabilization of the orbitals of C60, resulting in a less negative first-reduction potentials compared to C60. For compounds 8, 10, and 11, the folding of the addend prevents periconjugative effects. Theoretical calculations performed on 3a\xe2\x80\xa2- and 3a2- at the semiempirical (PM3), density functional (B3P86/3-21G), and ab initio (HF/6-31G*) levels indicate that the attachment of the first electron causes the homolytic cleavage of one of the bonds connecting the addend to C60. The resulting open-cyclopropane structure is stabilized by the aromaticity of the phenoxyl radical structure presented by the addend. The second electron enters in the addend forming the phenoxyl anion. This ring opening is supported by ESR measurements and explains the irreversible electrochemical behavior of compounds 3. The nonconjugated nature of the cyclohexanone ring in 6 determines that reduction takes place via a closed-cyclopropane structure with an electrochemical behavior similar to that observed for C60. Compounds 8, 10, and 11 are proposed to undergo reduction via an open-cyclopropane structure now obtained after the attachment of the second electron which produces the heterolytic opening of the cyclopropane ring. The lack of planarity shifts the reduction of the addend to more negative potentials. "
"Endohedral complexes of fullerenes and noble-gas atoms were originally prepared by a mass spectrometric method involving high-energy collisions of fullerene ions and noble-gas targets and, following that, by a high-pressure, high-temperature method involving neutral fullerenes and a noble gas as reactants. The latter method has made available sufficient quantities of the endohedral complexes of C60 and C70 with the various noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, and Kr) that the tandem mass spectrometric method can be used to test the possibility of preparing a new class of endohedral complexes that contain two noble-gas atoms. These new capture complexes do indeed form upon activation of the radical cation of the noble-gas endohedral complex by high-energy collisions with helium atoms. These complexes then decompose to give equivalent parallel losses of C2 units accompanied by expulsion of none, one, or both of the captured noble-gas atoms. The capture event causes the gain in excess of 34 eV of additional internal energy, but the capture complexes survive on the time scale (\xe2\x88\xbc50 \xce\xbcs) for the transit through the tandem mass spectrometer. Their survival, along with their fragmentation characteristics, is consistent with formation of an endohedral complex containing both noble-gas atoms although the fullerene cage may now be distorted especially when the fullerene is C60. By analogy with the properties of empty fullerene and endohedral metallofullerene complexes, end points exist for the equivalent number of C2 units that can be expelled to give a closed-structure product that contains either one or two noble-gas atoms. These end points correlate directly with the sizes of the fullerene and the noble-gas atom(s), giving support to our conclusion that endohedral complexes containing two noble gases can be prepared.

"We calculate the reaction rate constant of the rearrangement of trans-Rh(PH3)2Cl(\xce\xb72-CH4) to Rh(PH3)2ClH(CH3), in which the C\xe2\x88\x92H bond of methane is activated, Rh(I) is oxidized to Rh(III), and methane is cleaved. Quantum zero point energy is included in 39 vibrational modes, excited vibrational states are also quantized, and quantum mechanical tunneling contributions are included by the multidimensional small-curvature tunneling approximation. Born\xe2\x88\x92Oppenheimer potential energies, reaction-path geometries, and vibrational frequencies needed for the rate calculations are obtained from density functional theory using the direct dynamics approach. At 200 K the rate constant calculated with quantum effects is 194 times larger than the rate constant calculated using classical mechanics to describe the atomic motion. Including quantized vibrational energies but not tunneling reduces this discrepancy to a factor of 3.4. These factors are increased to 2770 and 11 at 150 K and decreased to 20 to 1.67 at 300 K. Thus the effect of quantizing vibrations is greater than 1 order of magnitude over this entire temperature range. "
"Chen and Arnold (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993, 90, 5618\xe2\x88\x925622) have generated a 10 amino acid mutant (PC3) of subtilisin E (SE) that has enhanced activity in mixed DMF/water solvent systems. Through the use of molecular dynamics simulations on both SE and PC3 in water, DMF, and DMF/water (PC3 only) solvent systems, we have provided insights into how nonaqueous solvents affect protein structure and dynamics. On the basis of the observations reported herein, we propose that the PC3 mutant protein is more compatible with DMF as solvent than is the native SE protein. The concept of solvent compatibility embodies the ideas that in order for a protein to be active in organic solvents it must be able to retain its overall shape and that it must not become too rigid such that catalytic activity is compromised. Moreover, neither should the active site region be obstructed by conformational changes that block or structurally alter the active site nor should the active site binding pocket be blocked by solvent molecules (i.e., solvent inhibition). Attempts to determine how each individual amino acid substitution might cause these effects met with mixed results. Clearly, in the present case the individual mutations synergistically lead to the alteration in function through numerous subtle local changes in the structure and dynamics of the protein. Nonetheless, from the simulations, we were able to make some predictions regarding how a protein might be stabilized in a nonaqueous solvent environment. "
"The regiospecificity and stereoselectivity of alkane hydroxylation and alkene epoxidation by the particulate methane monooxygenase from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) was evaluated over a range of substrates. Oxidation products were identified by conventional GC analysis, and the stereoselectivity of oxidation was determined by a combination of chiral GC and HPLC methods, as well as 1H NMR analysis of the corresponding (R)-2-acetoxy-2-phenylethanoate ester derivatives in the case of alkanol products. Alkane hydroxylation was found to proceed favoring attack at the C-2 position in all cases, and the stereoselectivity for n-butane and n-pentane was characterized by an enantiomeric excess of 46% and 80%, respectively, with preference for the (R)-alcohol noted for both substrates. Epoxides were formed with smaller stereoselectivities. Together, the regio- and stereoselectivity results suggest that an equilibrium of competing substrate binding modes exists. A simple substrate-binding model that incorporates preferential C-2 oxidation with the observed stereoselectivity of alkane hydroxylation is proposed, and hypotheses for the general mechanism are suggested and discussed.

"The ability of clip shaped molecules based on the building block diphenylglycoluril to form complexes with dihydroxybenzene guest molecules has been studied in detail. The binding strength of these complexes can be varied over a wide range (Ka \xe2\x89\x88 0\xe2\x88\x92105 M-1), by applying small modifications in the host or the guest molecule. It is found that the complexation is a combination of different effects, viz., hydrogen bonding, \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 stacking interactions, and a cavity effect. "

This carbanion partitions between returning the hydron to carbon, k-1, and the loss of halide, . Isotope effects at 25 \xc2\xb0C for I, (kH/kD)Obs = 3.40 and (kH/kT)Obs = 6.20, and II, (kH/kD)Obs = 3.49 and (kH/kT)Obs = 6.55, result in similar values for a:\xe2\x80\x89 aH = 0.59, aD = 0.13\xe2\x88\x920.14 and aT = 0.07. Smaller values of (kH/kD)Obs = 2.19 and (kH/kT)Obs = 3.56 for III are due to more internal return [aH = 1.9, aD = 0.50, and aT = 0.28] associated with the dehydrofluorination reaction. Calculation of k1 (= kObs [a + 1]) results in similar isotope effects for hydron transfer in these reactions:\xe2\x80\x89 I, / = 4.74 and / = 9.20; II, /kD1 = 4.91 and / = 9.75; III, / = 4.75 and / = 9.17. Reactions of m-ClC6H4CiHBrCH2Br and m-ClC6H4CiHClCH2Br have very small amounts of internal return, aH = 0.05 and aD = 0.01, and (kH/kD)Obs = 4.95 results in / = 5.11. The measured isotope effects are therefore due to differences in the amount of internal return and not in the symmetry of transition state structures for the hydron transfer, and the element effect, (kHBr/kHCl) = 29, for m-ClC6H4CHClCH2X is mainly due to the hydron-transfer step, / = 19, and not the breaking of the C\xe2\x88\x92X bond. The kinetic solvent isotope effects, kMeOD/kMeOH \xe2\x89\x88 2.5, are consistent with three methanols of solvation lost prior to the hydron-transfer step. The energetics associated with desolvation of methoxide ion are part of the measured reaction energetics of these systems. "
"The carbonyl-carbon kinetic isotope effect (KIE) and the substituent effect were measured for the reaction of lithium pinacolone enolate (CH2C(OLi)C(CH3)3) with benzaldehyde, and the results were compared with those for other lithium reagents such as MeLi, PhLi, and CH2CHCH2Li. Ab initio MO calculations (HF/6-31+G*) were carried out to estimate the equilibrium IE on the addition to benzaldehyde. A carbonyl addition reaction, in general, proceeds by way of either a polar direct nucleophilic attack (PL) in a one-step or a two-step process going through a radical ion intermediate (eq 1). The carbonyl-carbon KIE is of primary nature for the PL or the RC rate-determining ET mechanism, while it is considered to be secondary for the ET rate-determining mechanism. The reaction of lithium pinacolone enolate with benzaldehyde gave a small positive KIE (12k/13k = 1.019), which is larger than the theoretical equilibrium IE (12K/13K = 1.006) determined by the MO calculations. Thus, there is a reaction-coordinate contribution to the observed KIE. This is in sharp contrast to the absence of KIE (12k/14k = 1.000) measured previously for the MeLi addition. Dehalogenation and enone-isomerization probe experiments showed no evidence of a single electron transfer to occur during the course of the reaction. The primary carbonyl-carbon KIE together with the substituent effect and chemical probe experiments led to the conclusion that the reaction of lithium pinacolone enolate with benzaldehyde proceeds via the polar mechanism.

"This paper reports on the solvent effect on energy transfer reactions in supercritical CO2. The energy transfer reactions are studied by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and the fluorophor/quencher reaction pairs are chosen to vary the reactions from diffusion-controlled to kinetically-controlled. In particular, the fluorescence quenching of anthracene by CBr4, 1,2-benzanthracene by CBr4, and anthracene by C2H5Br in supercritical CO2 at 35 \xc2\xb0C has been reported. Experimental rate constants for the first two reaction pairs, anthracene/CBr4 and 1,2-benzanthracene/CBr4, follow the predicted diffusion control limit at all pressures from 77.9 to 160.6 bar, indicating that local solvation does not enhance the reaction rate nor substantially impede the diffusion process in supercritical CO2. The rate constants for the third reaction, the quenching of anthracene by C2H5Br, are several orders of magnitude below the diffusion control limit, indicating that the reaction is kinetically controlled, as it is in liquids. In supercritical CO2 the apparent rate constants (i.e., those based on bulk concentrations of the reactants) for the anthracene/C2H5Br reaction decrease dramatically with increasing pressure. We believe that this apparently large pressure effect on the reaction rate is primarily due to the local composition enhancement of the quencher molecules around the dilute anthracene solute. This analysis is supported by fluorescence spectra and solvatochromic shift data of anthracene in pure CO2 and in mixtures of CO2 with C2H5Br at 35 \xc2\xb0C that indicate both local density augmentation and local composition increases around the anthracene.

"Reactions of protoanemonin, 1, and 3-bromo- and 3-methoxy-5-methylene-2(5H)-furanones, 2 and 3, with dienes have been performed under both thermal and photochemical activation conditions. Photochemical cycloadditions of butadiene and trans-piperylene to this kind of furanones have afforded 1,2-adducts, 10\xe2\x88\x9213, as stereoisomeric mixtures, in 40\xe2\x88\x9260% yields, and have shown that furanones 1\xe2\x88\x923 react specifically at the exocyclic double bond as they do in thermal conditions. Furthermore, thermal cycloadditions have led to the production of the corresponding 1,4-adducts, 4\xe2\x88\x927, in good yields, but 10\xe2\x88\x9213 have also been detected at the initial stages of these reactions. Compounds 10\xe2\x88\x9213 have been proved to be intermediates in the production of adducts 4\xe2\x88\x927, isomerization taking place under heating and involving the formation of biradical species as intermediates. Moreover, cycloreversion from 1,4-adducts has not been observed, and only very small proportions (1\xe2\x88\x928%) of the corresponding furanones have been found when 1,2-adducts have been heated. In good agreement with these results, CASSCF and DFT ab initio theoretical calculations, performed on the reaction of 1 and butadiene to give 4, have shown the nonconcerted mechanism to be more favorable than the concerted process, and have allowed the location of all intermediates and transition states involved in the overall process. Since, in addition, the presence of radicals in the isomerization of 1,2-adducts to 1,4-adducts has been confirmed with ESR spin trapping techniques, we can conclude that the resulting Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder adducts are mainly produced via a biradical mechanism. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a biradical mechanism operating in a Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder cycloaddition and accounting for the production of 1,4-adducts has been evidenced and rationalized.

"Reaction of folic acid (1) with excess trifluoroacetic anhydride provides access to both the previously unknown N10-(trifluoroacetyl)pyrofolic acid (8) and pyrofolic acid (9). Reaction of either of these materials with hydrazine selectively affords pteroyl hydrazide (13), which may be oxidized to pteroyl azide (27) on a large scale (62% overall from 1 without the need for chromatography). Treatment of 27 with differentially protected glutamates provides a convenient and high-yielding synthesis of differentially protected, optically pure folates. "
"tert-Butyl 2-en-7-ynoate 6 was treated with (\xce\xb72-propene)Ti(O-i-Pr)2 (3), generated in situ from Ti(O-i-Pr)4 or Ti(O-i-Pr)3Cl and i-PrMgCl, in ether at \xe2\x88\x9250 to \xe2\x88\x9220 \xc2\xb0C to afford the product 8 in good yield. The presence of the intermediate titanabicycle 7 was verified by bis-deuterolysis with excess D2O. When the titanabicycle 7 was treated with 1.1 equiv of i-PrOD and then worked up as usual, the monodeuterated product 10 was obtained with high site selectivity and stereoselectivity. Other electrophiles such as aldehydes and ketones also reacted with the titanabicycle in a highly stereoselective manner to give cyclopentanes having a stereo-defined side chain. On the contrary, treatment of the corresponding ethyl ester, ethyl 8-(trimethylsilyl)-(E)-2-octen-7-ynoate (28), with 3 under the same conditions followed by the addition of 1.1 equiv of s-BuOH afforded 2-(trimethylsilyl)-1-bicyclo[3.3.0]octen-3-one (32) in 80% yield. Quenching the same reaction mixture with i-PrOD, EtCHO, and Et2CO in place of s-BuOH gave 4-deuterio (with exclusive deuterium incorporation), 4-(1-hydroxypropyl), and 4-(1-ethyl-1-hydroxypropyl) derivatives of the above bicyclic ketone (34, 35, and 36) in good yields. These electrophiles were always introduced from the convex face of the bicyclic skeleton. The stereochemistry of the cyclization could be controlled by an allylic substituent such as (tert-butyl)dimethylsiloxy or butyl group to a high degree yet with a reversal diastereoselection to give 45 or 47. The reaction of ethyl 7-octen-2-ynoate (56) and 3 at \xe2\x88\x9250 to 0 \xc2\xb0C took place in a quite different way to afford 1-[(ethoxycarbonyl)methyl]bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane (64) in 74% yield after hydrolysis. If the simple hydrolysis is replaced by deuterolysis or the action of diethyl ketone, 1-[(ethoxycarbonyl)dideuteriomethyl] (with 99% deuterium incorporation), or 1-[(ethoxycarbonyl)(3-pentylidene)methyl] derivative of the above product (65 or 66) was obtained in good yields. A 7-en-2-ynoate having an internal Z-double bond such as 80 afforded a single stereoisomer 82 with the substituent at the endo position of the bicyclic skeleton, suggesting that the stereochemical integrity of the Z-double bond of the starting material was retained in the product. An alkyl substituent at the allylic position of the substrates like 74 and 76 nicely controlled the stereochemistry of the cyclization to afford single products 75 and 77 with the substituent being placed in the exo orientation of the bicyclic structure. This high diastereoselectivity was successfully applied to an enantioselective synthesis of d-sabinene from an optically active enynoate via nearly complete chirality transfer. "
"The alternating copolymerization of 3,3-dimethylallene with carbon monoxide was achieved using [Pd(PPh3)2(MeCN)2](BF4)2 as the catalyst. The use of bidentate phosphines resulted in drastically reduced yields. In order to gain insight into the copolymerization mechanism, the stepwise successive insertions of 3,3-dimethylallene and carbon monoxide into palladium\xe2\x88\x92carbon bonds in the complexes, Pd(PPh3)2(Me)(Cl), [Pd(PPh3)2(C(O)-C6H4-Me-p)(MeCN)](BF4), and [Pd[(Dppp)(Me)(MeCN)](BF4) (Dppp:\xe2\x80\x89 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane), were studied. These studies, in turn, led to a novel living catalytic system which was used to synthesize a terpolymer with alt-allene-carbon monoxide and alt-ethene-carbon monoxide blocks. "
"An operationally simple method has been developed for the stereocontrolled construction of polypropionate stereotriads in high enantio- and diastereomeric purities. The method consists of the stereocontrolled addition of lithium dimethylcuprate to an enantiopure \xce\xb3-alkoxy-\xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated ester, followed by hydroxylation of the corresponding enolate. This leads to an anti/syn orientation of the \xce\xb3-alkoxy-\xce\xb2-methyl-\xce\xb1-hydroxy ester unit. Chain extension and reiteration of the process, after appropriate functionalization, lead ultimately to an 11-carbon acyclic chain harboring three contiguous polypropionate triads with the correct anticipated absolute configuration. The method relies on two basic bond-forming reactions that involve consecutive 1,2-induction. It is admirably stereocontrolled through four iterative cycles of cuprate additions and hydroxylations. Inversion of the \xce\xb1-alkoxy group after each \xce\xb1-hydroxylation allows passage to stereotriads of different configurations. Thus three of the four possible stereotriad combinations are accessible directly using this simple and general method. The C19\xe2\x88\x92C28 acyclic chain of rifamycin S, harboring eight stereogenic carbon atoms (three triads), was constructed starting with an enantiopure precursor that contains a single stereogenic center. A common precursor serves as the starting chiron for a variety of other propionate derived macrolides and ionophores. "
"The structure of two chiral N,N\xe2\x80\x98-disubstituted-3-aminopyrrolidine lithium amides 3 and 4 in solution in THF-d8 has been studied at low temperatures by high-field 1H, 13C, and 6Li NMR spectroscopy. Despite their structural analogy, these two compounds adopt very different conformations in solution:\xe2\x80\x89 while the amide 3 pyrrolidinic ring undergoes only minor changes with respect to its amino precursor 1, amide 4 presents a norbornyl-like bridged structure around 6Li+. When excess Bu6Li is added to both amide solutions, 1:1 amide\xe2\x88\x92Bu6Li complexes arise, and their structures appear, this time, very similar and organized around a parallepipedic N\xe2\x88\x92Li2\xe2\x88\x92C core, the two lithium cations bridging the amide and the alkyl chain. The 4\xe2\x88\x92Bu6Li complex appears very tight, with two distinct signals corresponding to each of the diastereotopic \xce\xb1-protons of butyllithium, by contrast with the looser 3\xe2\x88\x92Bu6Li complex. From all these data, we propose a model to interpret the results obtained using these chiral amides in the asymmetric condensation of butyllithium with aromatic aldehydes. "
"It is well-recognized that aldimines are less reactive than aldehydes toward nucleophilic additions. In this paper, an unprecedented change in the reactivity is described:\xe2\x80\x89 preferential reactions of aldimines over aldehydes in nucleophilic additions using a lanthanide salt as a Lewis acid catalyst. In the presence of a catalytic amount of ytterbium triflate (Yb(OTf)3), only aldimines reacted with silyl enol ethers, ketene silyl acetals, allyltributylstannane, or cyanotrimethylsilane to afford the corresponding adducts in high yields, even in the coexistence of aldehydes. Selective formation of an aldimine\xe2\x88\x92Yb(OTf)3 complex rather than an aldehyde\xe2\x88\x92Yb(OTf)3 complex was indicated by 13C NMR analyses. While this report demonstrates the effective use of Lewis acids in organic synthesis, the basic idea of changing reactivity as shown here will be widely applied to many other nucleophilic additions.

"[5]- and [6]helicenebisquinones can be prepared easily and in quantity by combining enol ethers of 1,4-diacetylbenzene or 2,7-diacetylnaphthalene with p-benzoquinone. Similar diethenyl aromatics that either have no ether functions or have them attached not to the double bonds, but to the aromatic rings, give the corresponding helicenes in only low yields and low purities. [6]Helicenebisquinone 11c is resolved into its enantiomers. An X-ray diffraction analysis of the adduct of one of these enantiomers and l-prolinol shows the absolute stereochemistry of 11c and the regiochemistry with which the amine adds to the quinone. "
"Glycals were converted into thioethyl glycosyl donors through 1,2-anhydrosugar intermediates. Various participating groups in the C-2 position were examined for formation of \xce\xb2-glucosyl, \xce\xb2-galactosyl, and \xce\xb1-mannosyl linkages. A number of disaccharides was prepared employing a novel coupling protocol involving thioethyl 2-pivaloyl glycosyl donors and glycal acceptors. Using this methodology, a linear tetrasaccharide containing exclusively \xce\xb2-glucosyl-(1\xe2\x86\x924) linkages was prepared in high yields. Ready application to \xce\xb1-mannosylation and C2 branching are other hallmarks of the method. "
"Convergent, stereocontrolled total syntheses of the microtubule-stabilizing macrolides epothilones A (2) and B (3) have been achieved. Four distinct ring-forming strategies were pursued (see Scheme 1). Of these four, three were reduced to practice. In one approach, the action of a base on a substance possessing an acetate ester and a nonenolizable aldehyde brought about a remarkably effective macroaldolization see (89 \xe2\x86\x92 90 + 91; 99 \xe2\x86\x92 100 + 101), simultaneously creating the C2\xe2\x88\x92C3 bond and the hydroxyl-bearing stereocenter at C-3. Alternatively, the 16-membered macrolide of the epothilones could be fashioned through a C12\xe2\x88\x92C13 ring-closing olefin metathesis (e.g. see 111 \xe2\x86\x92 90 + 117; 122 \xe2\x86\x92 105 + 123) and through macrolactonization of the appropriate hydroxy acid (e.g. see 88 \xe2\x86\x92 93). The application of a stereospecific B-alkyl Suzuki coupling strategy permitted the establishment of a cis C12\xe2\x88\x92C13 olefin, thus setting the stage for an eventual site- and diastereoselective epoxidation reaction (see 96 \xe2\x86\x92 2; 106 \xe2\x86\x92 3). The development of a novel cyclopropane solvolysis strategy for incorporating the geminal methyl groups of the epothilones (see 39 \xe2\x86\x92 40 \xe2\x86\x92 41), and the use of Lewis acid catalyzed diene\xe2\x88\x92aldehyde cyclocondensation (LACDAC) (see 35 + 36 \xe2\x86\x92 37) and asymmetric allylation (see 10 \xe2\x86\x92 76) methodology are also noteworthy.

"A novel one-step synthesis of the macrocyclic triserine trilactone scaffold of the siderophore enterobactin, which eliminates the \xce\xb2-lactonization step of N-tritylserine, is presented. The cyclization reaction is based on a stannoxane template and leads to an overall yield of \xe2\x88\xbc50%. This enables the practical functionalization of the trilactone by attaching chelating groups other than catecholamides. The conformational stability of the trilactone ring has been examined by high-resolution X-ray diffraction studies of the N-trityl intermediate:\xe2\x80\x89 crystals grown from methylene chloride:methanol are orthorhombic, space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 9.2495(5) \xc3\x85, b = 11.3584(1) \xc3\x85, c = 48.945(1) \xc3\x85, V = 5142.1(2) \xc3\x853, and Z = 4. A hydroxypyridinonate analog of enterobactin, N,N\xe2\x80\x98,N\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-tris[(3-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-oxo-(1H-pyridinyl)carbonyl]-4-cyclotriseryl trilactone (hopobactin), has been prepared by attachment of three 3-hydroxy-1-methyl-2(1H)-pyridinonate (3,2-HOPO) moieties to the triserine trilactone. This ligand represents the first enterobactin analog that retains the trilactone scaffold, but employs chelates other than catecholamides. Crystals of the chiral ferric complex grown from DMF:diethyl ether are monoclinic, space group P21, with unit cell dimensions a = 13.0366(9) \xc3\x85, b = 22.632(2) \xc3\x85, c = 27.130(2) \xc3\x85, b = 100.926(1)\xc2\xb0, V = 7860(1) \xc3\x853, and Z = 8. The \xce\x94 configuration of enterobactin metal complexes is also enforced in those of hopobactin and persists in aqueous or methanolic solution, as demonstrated by circular dichroism. The ferric hopobactin complex is the first reported chiral complex of hydroxypyridinonate ligands. The solution coordination chemistry of this new ligand and its iron(III) and iron(II) complexes have been studied by means of 1H NMR, potentiometric, spectrophotometric, and voltammetric methods. The average protonation constant of the hopobactin free ligand (log Kav = 6.1) is typical of other 3-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-oxo-1H-pyridin-4-carboxamide ligands. The stability constants of the iron(III) complex formed with hopobactin (log \xce\xb2110 = 26.4) and with the tris(2-aminoethyl)amine-based analog, TRENHOPO, (log \xce\xb2110 = 26.7) are of the same order of magnitude, unlike the catecholamide-based species, where enterobactin (log \xce\xb2110 = 49) is 6 orders of magnitude more stable than TRENCAM (log \xce\xb2110 = 43.6). The stability enhancement reflects the specific predisposition by the triserine scaffold of the catecholamide binding units. In spite of a significantly lower affinity of 3,2-hydroxypyridinonates for iron(III) compared with the more basic catecholates, hopobactin is an extraordinarily powerful chelating agent under acidic conditions:\xe2\x80\x89 No measurable dissociation is observed even in 1.0 M HCl. In contrast to enterobactin and its synthetic derivatives, the hopobactin ferric complex undergoes no sequential protonation above pH 1. The affinity of hopobactin and TRENHOPO for iron(III) relative to iron(II) results in strongly negative reduction potentials, \xe2\x88\x92782 mV vs 0.01 M Ag+/Ag in CH3CN or \xe2\x88\x92342 mV vs NHE in water and \xe2\x88\x92875 mV vs 0.01 M Ag+/Ag in CH3CN or \xe2\x88\x92435 mV vs NHE in water, respectively.

"This report details an extensive investigation on vanadium\xe2\x88\x92dinitrogen complexes containing the [V(\xce\xbc-N2)V]n+ skeleton with a variable oxidation state of the metal and reduction degree of dinitrogen, n varying from 6 \xe2\x86\x92 5 \xe2\x86\x92 4. This skeleton can be associated to alkali cations in ion-separated or ion-pair tight forms. The reaction of [(Mes)3V(thf)], 1 [Mes = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2], with Lewis acids [AlPh3, B(C6F5)3] removed the THF molecule leading under nitrogen to the formation of the diamagnetic complex [(Mes)3V(\xce\xbc-N2)V(Mes)3], 4. The reaction of 1 with N2 also occurs under reducing conditions using Na or K metals. As supported by the electrochemical study, the preliminary stage is in both cases the formation of the vanadium(II) desolvated form [V(Mes)3]-, 5. The reaction of 5 with N2 in the case of potassium and in the presence of 1 leads to the compound {[(Mes)3V(\xce\xbc-N2)V(Mes)3]-[K(digly)3]+}, 11, which, depending on the reaction conditions, undergoes a further reduction to [{K(digly)3(\xce\xbc-Mes)2(Mes)V}2(\xce\xbc-N2)], 12 [digly = diethylene glycol dimethyl ether]. Similarly, the reduction of 1 with sodium gave, depending on the workup mode, {[(Mes)3V(\xce\xbc-N2)V(Mes)3]2-[Na(digly)2]+2}, 13, or {[(Mes)3V(\xce\xbc-N2)(\xce\xbc-Na)V(Mes)3]-[Na(digly)2]+}, 14, both containing the dianion [(Mes)3V(\xce\xbc-N2)V(Mes)3]2-, 8. Complex 4 releases upon protonation exclusively N2, while complexes 11\xe2\x88\x9214 release N2, N2H4, and NH3 in amounts depending on the degree of reduction of the dinitrogen and the structure of the complex. The electrochemical reduction of 1 shed light on the intermediate formation of 5 and its conversion to 8, which was oxidized to the monoanion [(Mes)3V(\xce\xbc-N2)V(Mes)3]-, 7 (which is the precursor of 8 in the chemical reduction). The magnetic studies coupled with the theoretical interpretation are in agreement with the presence of a d2\xe2\x88\x92d2 couple in 4, a d1\xe2\x88\x92d1 in 12\xe2\x88\x9214, and a d1\xe2\x88\x92d0 in 11. This, along with the structural studies on 11\xe2\x88\x9214, suggest a cumulenic structure [VNNV]+n [n = 5, 4] for 11\xe2\x88\x9214. "
"Colloidal dispersions of nanometer sized palladium colloids with very high stability were prepared in block copolymer micelles of polystyrene-b-poly-4-vinylpyridine and analyzed by electron microscopy and X-ray analysis. The resulting polymer/metal hybrids can easily be dissolved and handled in standard organic solvents such as toluene, tetrahydrofuran, and cyclohexane. They were successfully used for the Pd-catalyzed carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon coupling of aryl halides with alkenes (Heck reaction). Such block copolymer stabilized palladium colloids exhibit about the same reactivity as low molecular weight Pd complexes classically used for the Heck reaction, but show a much higher stability:\xe2\x80\x89 in most reactions, the hybrids remain catalytically active even after 50000 turn-over cycles. Reaction rates were significantly controlled by the reactivity of the educts, but also respond to micelle architecture and dispersity of the palladium. Other advantages of the block copolymer stabilizer are that they are more simple and readily accessible than the phosphor-containing chelates, and that they dissolve even in \xe2\x80\x9csimple\xe2\x80\x9d solvents such as toluene (instead of amidic solvents).

"The resting state of nitrogenase shows an S = 3/2 electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal resulting from the FeMo-cofactor (MoFe7S9:homocitrate) of the MoFe protein. When the enzyme undergoes turnover under a CO atmosphere, this signal disappears and two new ones appear:\xe2\x80\x89 one under low pressure of CO (denoted lo-CO; 0.08 atm) and the other under high pressure of CO (denoted hi-CO; 0.5 atm). Our recent Q-band (35 GHz) 13C and 57Fe electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) studies demonstrated that one CO is bound to the FeMo-cofactor of lo-CO and two to the cofactor of hi-CO. [Christie, P. D.; Lee, H. I.; Cameron, L. M.; Hales, B. J.; Orme-Johnson, W. H.; Hoffman, B. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 8707\xe2\x88\x928709. Pollack, R. C.; Lee, H. I.; Cameron, L.

Soc. 1995, 117, 8686\xe2\x88\x928687.] In the present report, we examine the CO-bound FeMo-cofactor in both the lo- and hi-CO forms of the MoFe protein from Azotobacter vinelandii by complete orientation-selective 13C and 1H ENDOR measurements. 1H ENDOR studies reveal that well-resolved signals from a solvent-exchangeable proton seen in the resting state FeMo-cofactor are lost in both of the CO-inhibited forms, indicating a loss in hydrogen bonding as compared to the resting state. This supports the hypothesis that CO binds near the \xe2\x80\x9cwaist\xe2\x80\x9d of the cofactor. Determination of 13C hyperfine tensors of bound 13CO to lo-CO and hi-CO leads to the suggestion that the single CO bound to the FeMo-cofactor of lo-CO may bridge or semibridge two iron ions, while each of the two CO bound to hi-CO is a terminal ligand. These ENDOR measurements and recent FTIR results of Thorneley and co-workers [George, S. J.; Ashby, G. A.; Wharton, C. W.; Thorneley, R. N. F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 6450\xe2\x88\x926451] provide strong mutual support. "
"The reversible oxidative addition reactions of methyl(halogeno)tin and methyl(halogeno)germanium compounds to electron-rich platinum(II) complexes of the type [PtMe2(diimine)] have been studied.

Kinetic studies clearly point to an SN2 mechanism for the reactions studied, and this is further supported by the observation of the cationic complex [PtMe2(Me3Sn)(bpy-tbu2){OC(CD3)2}]+ at low temperature in acetone-d6. Extremely large second-order rate constants are observed for the oxidative addition of Sn\xe2\x88\x92X bonds to dimethylplatinum(II) complexes, some being greater than 108 M-1 s-1, and it is established that rates follow the series Sn > Ge > Si > C and I > Br > Cl. Estimates have been made of the Pt\xe2\x88\x92MMe3 bond dissociation energies for [PtXMe2(MMe3)(bpy-tbu2)], X = halide, and these are 233, 182, and 172 kJ mol-1 for M = Si, Ge, and Sn, respectively; the values are useful in rationalizing the chemistry of the Pt\xe2\x88\x92M bonds.

"The deposition of Mo on \xce\xb3-alumina by the equilibrium adsorption method starting from ammonium heptamolybdate has been studied. Spectroscopic results converge to indicate that a previously unrecognized species, i.e., the Anderson-type heteropolymolybdate [Al(OH)6Mo6O18]3-, plays a major role in this type of synthesis as it is quantitatively formed in the solution within a few hours, by reaction of the heptamolybdate with dissolved aluminic species. This results in a considerable increase of alumina solubility in conditions generally thought to be nonaggressive. Furthermore, this species is also present in the solid catalyst after deposition, although it is harder to observe than in the liquid phase. A parallel is drawn with a well-known idea from the field of geochemistry, i.e., ligand-promoted oxide dissolution. The relevance of this phenomenon in catalyst preparation is evaluated in realistic conditions corresponding to published studies and/or industrial procedures. It is concluded that strong metal\xe2\x88\x92support interaction in the deposition stage by surface dissolution followed by reaction in the liquid phase is most likely to be an important phenomenon, not only for cationic metal precursors as previously known but also for anionic precursors such as molybdates.

"The transition structures for the epoxidations of ethylene by performic acid, dioxirane, oxaziridine, and peroxynitrous acid have been located with density functional theory methods using the Becke3LYP functional and 6-31G* basis set. All of the epoxidations have spiro transition states; those with performic acid and dioxirane are early and involve synchronous oxygen transfer, while those with oxaziridine and peroxynitrous acid are later with asynchronous oxygen transfer. The results from Becke3LYP/6-31G* theory are compared with MP2/6-31G* literature values. Substitution on ethylene by methoxy, methyl, vinyl, and cyano groups changes the transition state geometries toward asynchronous spiro structures. The activation energies are lowered by all substituents except the cyano group in reactions of performic acid and dioxirane. Experimental stereoselectivities are rationalized by using transition structure models based upon these transition structures. "
"Os(H)3ClL2 (L = PiPr3) forms a 1:1 adduct with L\xe2\x80\x98 = PEt3, NH3, MeCN, acetone, methanol, and THF. The case L\xe2\x80\x98 = PEt3 permits the clearest identification of adduct structure as pentagonal bipyramidal. For NH3 and MeCN, the respective kinetics of L\xe2\x80\x98 loss are measured as \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 20.7(3) and 17.6(3) kcal/mol and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 16(1) and 14.7(9) cal/(mol K). For acetone, methanol, and THF, the following respective \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 and \xce\x94S\xc2\xb0 values for L\xe2\x80\x98 binding are measured:\xe2\x80\x89 \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 = \xe2\x88\x9210.4(1), \xe2\x88\x926.66(8), and \xe2\x88\x925.8(2) kcal/mol; \xce\x94S\xc2\xb0 = \xe2\x88\x9241.8(5), \xe2\x88\x9225.5(3), and \xe2\x88\x9233(1) cal/(mol K). Decoalesced 1H NMR spectra are reported for several of these Os(H)3ClL2L\xe2\x80\x98 species, and they show a variety of examples of quantum exchange coupling among the hydride ligands. The values of Jex are higher when L\xe2\x80\x98 is a more weakly-binding ligand. The quantum exchange coupling constants of Os(H)3XL2 (X = Cl, Br, I, OCH2CF3, OCH(CF3)2) in CD2Cl2, in toluene, and in methylcyclohexane show an unprecedented decrease of J with increasing temperature, which is attributed to weak formation of Os(H)3Cl(solvent)L2 adducts at low temperature. For L\xe2\x80\x98 = CO, adduct formation leads to liberation of coordinated H2. Excess L\xe2\x80\x98 = MeCN or NH3 slowly leads to formation of [Os(H)3L\xe2\x80\x982L2]Cl; the X-ray structure for L\xe2\x80\x98 = NH3 is reported. Crystal data (\xe2\x88\x92171 \xc2\xb0C):\xe2\x80\x89 a = 11.561(4) \xc3\x85, b = 14.215(5) \xc3\x85, c = 8.851(3) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb1 = 97.51(2)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb2 = 107.73(2)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb3 = 104.47(2)\xc2\xb0, with Z = 2 in space group P1\xcc\x84. The potential energy was calculated for exchange of 2H of OsH3X(PH3)2L (X = Cl with L = no ligand and PH3, X = I with L = no ligand) using effective core potential ab initio methods at the MP2 level. The site exchange is found to be energetically easier for Cl than for I, in agreement with experiment. The hydride site exchange in the seven-coordinate species OsH3Cl(PH3)3 (a model for coordination of either ligand or solvent to Os) is found to be easier than that in the 16-electron species. No dihydrogen ligand is located on the reaction path for site exchange. The current theory which relates quantum exchange to a tunneling effect was used for calculating Jex as a function of temperature. The dynamic study was done using several sets of coordinates, in particular the rotation angle \xcf\x86 and the internuclear distance r between the exchanging H. The vibrational levels have been calculated and the symmetry of each level assigned within the permutation group in order to determine the nature of the nuclear spin function associated with each level. It is found that the rotation, \xcf\x86, gives rise to the largest tunneling effect but that r cannot be neglected. The influence of the temperature, Jex(T), was included by a Boltzmann distribution. The results are in qualitative agreement with experiment in that quantum exchange coupling is larger in the case of Cl than in the case of I. Additional ligand L increases the value of the quantum exchange coupling mostly by lowering the activation energy for pairwise exchange. "
"The in situ photolytic exchange of ethylene and hydrogen for carbon monoxide on cymantrene (CpMn(CO)3 , Cp = \xce\xb75-cyclopentadienyl) and methylcymantrene (MeCpMn(CO)3, MeCp = monomethyl-\xce\xb75-cyclopentadienyl) dissolved in subcritical and supercritical solvents (CO2 and ethylene) was investigated by high-resolution, high-pressure 1H NMR over the temperature range from \xe2\x88\x9240 to 150 \xc2\xb0C and a pressure range from 35 to 2600 bar. Photolytic substitution of ethylene for CO proceeded to completion under all conditions investigated, and only one ethylene was observed to substitute for CO on the manganese complexes even in neat ethylene under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature. Only small amounts of dihydrogen were observed to substitute for CO on cymantrene at 35 \xc2\xb0C in a binary solvent mixture of CO2/H2 during photolysis. The 1H chemical shifts of the manganese complexes and their ethylene substituted products were found to be linearly dependent on density with temperature and solvent dependence also observed. The spin\xe2\x88\x92lattice relaxation times (T1) of all the solvent and solute species were observed to be inversely proportional to the density of the solvent over the range of conditions investigated. Temperature and concentration dependent phase behavior and solute saturation were also determined for the methylcymantrene and MeCpMn(CO)2(\xce\xb72-C2H4) solutes in SCF ethylene. These results represent the first NMR detected in situ photolysis study of organometallics in SCF and demonstrate the utility of this technique. "
"The oxidative addition of the F\xe2\x88\x92CH3 bond to coordinatively unsaturated trans-M(X)(PH3)2 (M = Rh, Ir; X = CH3, H, Cl) was theoretically investigated by density functional theory. All of the stationary points were determined at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level. A configuration mixing model based on the theory of Pross and Shaik has been used to develop an explanation for the barrier height as well as the reaction enthalpy. Our theoretical findings suggest that the singlet\xe2\x88\x92triplet splitting (\xce\x94Est = Etriplet \xe2\x88\x92 Esinglet) of the ML3 species can be used as a basis to predict its reaction activity for oxidative additions; i.e., the smaller the \xce\x94Est of ML3, the lower the barrier height and the larger the exothermicity, in turn, the faster the oxidative addition reaction. Considering the substituent effect, and the nature of the central metal, the following conclusions therefore emerge:\xe2\x80\x89 for the 14-electron trans-M(X)(PH3)2 complex, a stronger \xcf\x80-donor ligand (such as Cl) as well as a heavier transition metal center (the third-row) will result in a smaller \xce\x94Est, and thus will provide a potential model for the oxidative addition of saturated C\xe2\x88\x92F bonds. In this work, an energetically feasible reaction mechanism which should not have radical intermediates involved is suggested. "
"Barium oxide supported on magnesium oxide (Ba/MgO) exhibits unusual behavior as a catalyst for NO decomposition at Ba loadings of 11 mol % or greater. The catalytic activity is characterized by a sharp decrease in activity when the reaction temperature exceeds a certain value that depends on the partial pressures of NO and O2. The fall-off temperatures are between 630 and 700 \xc2\xb0C for concentrations between 1% and 4% NO in helium. At 700 \xc2\xb0C with 4% NO, the N2 formation rate was 2.5 \xce\xbcmol g-1 s-1 for a 14 mol % Ba/MgO catalyst. The discontinuity in activity is accompanied by an abrupt change in activation energy for the reaction, which suggests a change in mechanism. In situ Raman spectroscopy was used to follow temporal changes in the composition of the catalyst that occurred after step changes in temperature or NO concentration. A comparison of spectroscopic and catalytic results indicates that a barium\xe2\x88\x92nitro phase is an intermediate in the catalytic cycle below the fall-off temperature. Nitro species at the surface apparently react with NO to form the decomposition products, N2 and O2. This is believed to be the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle. Peroxide ions may be involved in the formation of the nitro intermediate. "
"The spectroscopic properties of solvent soluble derivatives of Brooker\'s simple merocyanine 4-[(1-methyl-4(1H)-pyridinylidene)ethylidene]-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which can in principle exist in two distinct canonical forms, have been assessed both experimentally and theoretically using molecular orbital methods. 1H and 13C NMR evidence in a range of solvents suggests that the merocyanine exists as a resonance hybrid which is weighted toward the zwitterion even in solvents of low dielectric constants. In protic solvents, the large hypsochromic shift observed for the merocyanine in the visible region arises from both a dielectric effect and a hydrogen bonding effect. Theoretically, the PM3/COSMO method gives a reasonable account of the structure and spectroscopic shifts of the merocyanine in aprotic solvents. The large shifts observed arise because solvents with large dielectric constants have a much greater stabilizing effect on the more polar ground state of the merocyanine than they do on the first excited state. While the same method predicts stable hydrogen-bonded structures for a dihydrate and hexahydrate, it is unable to reproduce the known hypsochromic shift for these solvated species. In contrast, a version of the CNDO/S method does predict the correct trends on hydration though the magnitude of the effect is less than that found experimentally. "
"Flash photolysis of phenyldiazoacetic acid and the methyl, n-butyl, and isobutyl esters of benzoylformic acid in aqueous solution generated a transient species that was identified, through product determination and the form of acid\xe2\x88\x92base catalysis plus solvent isotope effects on its decay, as the enol of mandelic acid, 1. When benzoylformate esters were the flash photolysis substrates, the enol was formed by hydration of phenylhydroxyketene, 5, itself generated by Norrish type II photoelimination of the esters, and when phenyldiazoacetic acid was the substrate, the enol was formed by hydration of phenylcarboxycarbene, 6, produced by dediazotization of the diazo acid. Rates of enolization of mandelic acid were also determined, by monitoring the incorporation of deuterium into its \xce\xb1-position from a D2O solvent, and combination of these with rates of ketonization gave the keto\xe2\x88\x92enol equilibrium constant, pKE = 16.19. The acidity constant of the enol ionizing as an oxygen acid was determined as well, p = 6.39, and combination of that with KE led to the ionization constant of the keto form of mandelic acid ionizing as a carbon acid, p = 22.57. (These acidity constants are concentration quotients, applicable at ionic strength = 0.10 M.) These results are compared with other keto\xe2\x88\x92enol systems, and their bearing on the enzymatic racemization of mandelic acid is discussed. "
"1,4-Bis(2-tert-butyl-2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)benzene-1,4-diyl (2) its 2,5-dimethyl and 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl derivatives (3 and 4), their radical cations, and bis-radical dications are studied. Crystal structures including those of 2+BPh4-, 32+(BPh4-)2, 4+BPh4-, and 42+(BPh4-)2 establish that ring methylation causes more N-lone pair, aryl \xcf\x80 twist without changing the NAr,NAr distance significantly and that both 2+ and 4+ have the charge localized in one hydrazine unit. NMR measurements show that 3+ has about 6% of its spin at the four aryl CH and CMe carbons, while 4+ has about 1.5% of its spin at the four CMe carbons. The average distance between the unpaired electrons of 32+ and 42+ was obtained from the dipolar splittings of their thermally excited triplet states and, as expected, is significantly smaller for 32+ (5.25 \xc3\x85) than for 42+ (5.63 \xc3\x85). Rate constants for electron transfer between the hydrazine units of 3+ and 4+ in CH2Cl2 and CH3CN were determined by dynamic ESR. The intervalence radical cations show charge transfer bands corresponding to vertical electron transfer between the ground state and the highly vibrationally excited electron-shifted state, allowing calculation of the parameters controlling electron transfer. Electron transfer parameters obtained from the CT bands using adiabatic energy surfaces which approximate the CT band shapes observed produce rate constants within experimental error of those extrapolated to room temperature from the ESR data for both 3+ and 4+ in both solvents, without using tunneling corrections. The effects of mixing of the electronic wave functions of the reduced and oxidized hydrazine units of 2+ on dNN, the C(t-Bu)N,NA(Ar) twist angle, and the aryl nitrogen lone pair, aryl \xcf\x80 twist angle which are observed by X-ray are close to those predicted from the position of the minima on the ET coordinate X of the adiabatic energy surface calculated from the CT band.

"Experimental activation parameters for the intramolecular Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reactions of 1,3,8-nonatriene, 1,3,9-decatriene, and 1,3,10-undecatriene have been measured, and the Monte Carlo-Jumping between Wells/Stochastic Dynamics [MC(JBW)/SD] method, which gives relative free energies of activation, was tested as a means to predict stereoselectivities. The predictions are compared to experimental results, and to predictions from quantum and molecular mechanics methods. "
"The capacities of subtilisin Carlsberg (SC) and \xce\xb1-chymotrypsin (CT), which are representative of synthetically useful serine proteases, to discriminate between R- and S-configurations of stereocenters remote from the catalytic site have been further explored using chiral naphthyl aldehyde transition state analog inhibitors as probes. The inhibitors evaluated were (3R)- and (3S)-3-(1-naphthyl and 2-naphthyl)butanal and (4R)- and (4S)-4-(1-naphthyl and 2-naphthyl)pentanal, for which the methyl groups at the C-3 and C-4 stereocenters, respectively, are significantly removed from the aldehyde functionality that interactswith the catalytic serine residue. Each aldehyde was a competitive inhibitor for both enzymes, with CT being significantly more powerfully inhibited than SC. While only low levels of stereoselectivity were observed with SC, significant stereocenter discrimination was manifest for CT within this series of inhibitors with, encouragingly, the similar degrees of stereoselectivity (up to 3.9-fold) being observed between the enantiomers of the naphthylaldehyde inhibitors bearing both C-3 and C-4 remote methyl substituents. Furthermore, CT consistently favored the S-enantiomers within this series of inhibitor structures, which represents a reversal of the stereoselectivity observed previously for inhibition by the analogous phenyl substituted aldehydes. Molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics calculations were performed to identify the binding and orientation differences responsible for the R- and S-enantiomer binding discriminations observed. "
"Mechanistic studies have been carried out on the bacterial enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase, which catalyzes the interconversion of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and UDP-N-acetylmannosamine (UDP-ManNAc). This enzyme is interesting because it epimerizes a stereocenter that does not bear an acidic proton, and therefore it cannot utilize a simple deprotonation/reprotonation mechanism. A coupled enzyme assay employing UDP-ManNAc dehydrogenase has been developed. The epimerization in D2O is found to be accompanied by the incorporation of deuterium into the C-2\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 position of both epimers, supporting a mechanism that ultimately involves a proton transfer at this position. The epimerization of [2\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-2H]UDP-GlcNAc is slowed by a primary kinetic isotope effect indicating that C\xe2\x88\x92H bond cleavage is occurring during a rate-determining step of the reaction. A positional isotope exchange (PIX) experiment shows that an 18O label in the sugar-UDP bridging position will scramble into nonbridging diphosphate positions during enzymatic epimerization. These observations are consistent with a mechanism that proceeds via cleavage of the anomeric C\xe2\x88\x92O bond, with 2-acetamidoglucal and UDP as enzyme-bound intermediates. Additional evidence for this mechanism is found in the unusual observation that during extended incubations, the intermediates are gradually released from the enzyme and accumulate in solution. These intermediates are formed by an anti elimination of UDP from UDP-GlcNAc and a syn elimination of UDP from UDP-ManNAc. It is likely that E1-like eliminations via oxocarbenium intermediates are involved in the reaction. Further experiments show that 3\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-deoxy-UDP-GlcNAc is not a substrate for the enzyme and that the enzyme does not contain a tightly bound NAD+ cofactor. "
"Vibrational and electronic circular dichroism (VCD and ECD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the homo-oligopeptide series Z-[l-(\xce\xb1Me)Val]n-OtBu (n = 3\xe2\x88\x928) and selected Ac-[l-(\xce\xb1Me)Val]n-OtBu oligomers (n = 4, 6, 8) are presented. This is the first VCD study of a complete homopeptide series formed exclusively by C\xce\xb1-methylated amino acids. VCD spectra were measured for the oligomers in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) and CDCl3 over the amide I and amide II spectral regions (1750\xe2\x88\x921475 cm-1). These oligopeptides, irrespective of the N-terminal group, were found to indicate formation of at least a partially 310-helical conformation for main-chain lengths as short as n = 4 and a fully developed 310-helix by n = 6 at high peptide concentrations. A 310-helical conformation for the octamer is consistent with previous spectroscopic studies and crystallographic results. The ECD spectra were measured for the oligomer series in TFE and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) over the 260\xe2\x88\x92190 nm region. The ECD spectra, again for both N\xce\xb1-blocking groups, indicate a helical structure for the octamer, a mixed ordered/unordered structure at n = 6, and a predominantly coil form for n = 4. The octamer ECD band shape and FTIR absorption maximum are concentration dependent. At higher concentrations, the ECD mimics that which has been associated with a 310-helical conformation, while at lower concentrations the ECD is more typical of an \xce\xb1-helix. A study of the octamer in HFIP indicates a gradual transition from the 310-like to \xce\xb1-helical-like ECD spectra with time. While indicating the need for further study, these data are the first evidence of the possibility of a 310-helix to \xce\xb1-helix equilibrium shift induced by a change in peptide\xe2\x88\x92peptide interactions, with aggregation favoring the 310-helical form.

"The ligand/receptor pair consisting of a synthetic dimeric derivative of vancomycin (V), linked at the C terminus by p-xylylenediamine (V-CONHCH2C6H4CH2NHCO-V), and a dimeric derivative of l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, [CH2CON\xce\xb5H(N\xce\xb1-Ac)-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala-CO2-]2, provides a new system with which to study the influence of divalency on the strength of binding. A competitive assay using affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) has been developed and used to estimate the dissociation constant of the divalent complex (\xe2\x89\x88 1.1 nM) and the enhancement in binding (\xe2\x88\xbc103) relative to the corresponding monomeric interaction between unmodified monomeric vancomycin and diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala.

"The zwittazido cleavage reaction of the 4-azido-2-pyrrolinones is studied using the MP2/6-31G* and MP4SDQ/6-31G*//MP2/6-31G* levels of theory and taking into account the electrostatic effect of the solvent by means of a SCRF continuum model. Among the various reaction paths studied in this work, the most favored route for the thermolysis of 4-azido-2-pyrrolinone is shown to proceed through the expulsion of N2 from the trans conformer of reactant. This N2 elimination is the rate-determining step of the zwittazido process and leads to an azirine intermediate. The rearrangement of azirine to the zwitterionic intermediate may also proceed in a concerted manner no nitrene minimum being located on the MP2 PES. A reaction path through the formation of a triazole intermediate is not a competitive kinetic alternative to the N2 elimination from 4-azido-2-pyrrolinone. Concerning the evolution of the zwitterionic intermediates, different competing pathways are investigated (electrocylic closure to \xce\xb2-lactams, gauche-trans internal rotation, and fragmentation into cyanoketene and formaldimine). The solvent provides an important electrostatic stabilization of zwitterions increasing the energy barriers for the fragmentation. The electronic and steric roles of various substituents on the evolution of zwitterionic inermediates are examined through a set of calculations at the MP2/6-31G*//HF/6-31G* SCRF level including mono- and multi-substituted structures. It is shown that the electron donor groups at C3 and C5 and alkyl groups at N1 in the pyrrolinone ring favor the electrocyclic closure to \xce\xb2-lactams due to their torquoelectronic effect and steric hindrance, respectively, in a cooperative manner. Therefore, the effects of substituents and solvent are required to explain theoretically the experimental results by Moore et al. on the ring contraction of the 4-azido-2-pyrrolinones to the 3-cyano-2-azetidinones.

"The first enantioselective total synthesis of antifungal agent Sch 38516, also known as fluvirucin B1, is described. The synthesis includes a convergent asymmetric preparation of amine 17 and acid 18, which are then united to afford diene 62. Metal-catalyzed transformations play a crucial role in the synthesis of the latter moiety. Of particular note are the diastereo- and enantioselective Zr-catalyzed alkylations, a tandem Ti- and Ni-catalyzed process that constitutes a hydrovinylation reaction, and a Ru-catalyzed alcohol oxidation to afford carboxylic acid 18. The requisite carbohydrate 38 is synthesized in a highly diastereo- and enantioselective fashion. Optical purity of the carbohydrate moiety arises from the use of the asymmetric dihydroxylation method of Sharpless; diastereochemical control is achieved through a selective dipolar [3 + 2] cycloaddition with a readily available amine serving as the chiral auxiliary. Union of the appropriately outfitted carbohydrate 71 and diene 62 through an efficient and diastereoselective glycosylation is followed by a remarkably efficient Mo-catalyzed macrocyclization that proceeds readily at room temperature.

"Highly selective photodecarboxylation could be achieved by utilizing a series of two-component molecular crystals of aralkyl carboxylic acids such as 3-indolepropionic acid (a) and 1-naphthylacetic acid (b) combined with acridine (1) or phenanthridine (2) as an electron acceptor. The 1:1 hydrogen bonded crystals were prepared by recrystallization from the solutions. Irradiation of the crystals at \xe2\x88\x9270 \xc2\xb0C caused highly selective decarboxylation to give corresponding decarboxylated compounds alone in nearly quantitative yields, due to a smaller thermal motion of the radical species in the crystal lattice. Upon irradiating a crystal, a carboxylate radical and hydroacridine or hydrophenanthridine radical are produced via electron transfer from the acid to 1 or 2 and subsequent proton transfer followed by decarboxylation. Next hydrogen abstraction by an active aralkyl radical occurs in highest priority over the shortest distance of 3.2\xe2\x88\x923.5 \xc3\x85 resulting in the formation of a corresponding decarboxylated product and the regeneration of 1 or 2. Occurrence of radical coupling is low due to the longer coupling distance of 4.5\xe2\x88\x926.5 \xc3\x85 estimated from the crystallographic data of the starting two-component molecular crystals. The hydrogen abstraction path in the crystal lattice could be confirmed by the reaction of a deuterated crystal 1\xc2\xb7bD in which the CO2H group was replaced by CO2D, giving a deuterated 1-methyl(CH2D)naphthalene as a product. Regeneration of 1 or 2 means that the acceptor plays the role of a stoichiometrical sensitizer, which can act in only one cycle, retaining the initial crystal structure. Such a stoichiometrical sensitization is a novel photochemical process, which occurs specifically in the solid state. "
"The radical cations of three probe molecules (1\xe2\x88\x923) that undergo intramolecular cyclobutanation or Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reactions have been generated by both photoionization and photosensitized electron transfer. In each case, flash photolysis experiments indicate formation of an initial radical cation with \xce\xbbmax at \xe2\x88\xbc600 nm that is localized on the arylalkene moiety. The radical cations of 1 and 3 have decay rate constants of 1.2 \xc3\x97 109 and 3.0 \xc3\x97 108 s-1 and can only be observed by picosecond spectroscopy. These cyclization rate constants agree reasonably well with previous estimates based on product and Stern\xe2\x88\x92Volmer quenching studies using a triarylaminium salt as the electron transfer catalyst. The transient experiments are consistent with cyclization of 1\xe2\x80\xa2+ to give a cyclobutane radical cation that has a lifetime of \xe2\x88\xbc100 ns and decays by either reduction to cyclobutane or rearrangement to a hexatriene radical cation, \xce\xbbmax at 500 nm (10), but does not revert to 1\xe2\x80\xa2+. Consistent with this, product studies under photosensitized electron transfer conditions demonstrate that both substituted cyclobutane (5) and dihydronaphthalene (8) products are formed, with the relative amounts depending on the concentration of 1. Radical cation 2\xe2\x80\xa2+ is relatively long-lived with an apparent decay rate constant of 3 \xc3\x97 106 s-1; transient studies again provide evidence for rearrangement to a hexatriene radical cation. The observed decay rate is much lower than previous estimates and may indicate that the initial cyclobutane radical cation undergoes rapid cleavage (as observed for the all-trans-1,2-dianisyl-3,4-dimethylcyclobutane radical cation) in competition with rearrangement. The results illustrate some of the limitations that may be encountered in the development and calibration of intramolecular radical cation probes based on arylalkene cycloaddition chemistry. "
"Annelated triple-calix[4]arene-based tetradecaether 1-(OMe)14 is synthesized. Its three isomers, 1X-(OMe)14, 1Y-(OMe)14, 1Z-(OMe)14, are isolated and characterized. The corresponding triarylmethyl carbopolyanion is prepared and oxidized to polyradical 1. SQUID magnetometry for 1 in THF-d8/2-MeTHF gives S = 6.2, below the theoretical value of 7 expected for strong ferromagnetic coupling between 14 \xe2\x80\x9cunpaired\xe2\x80\x9d electrons. Chemical quenching studies suggest that approximately one deuterium from the deuterated solvent is incorporated in 1, thus accounting in part for S < 7. Study of the temperature dependence of magnetization indicates that ferromagnetic coupling between \xe2\x80\x9cunpaired\xe2\x80\x9d electrons is not very strong in 1; i.e., the thermal population of low-spin excited states is detected in the cryogenic temperature range. Upon exposure of 1 in THF-d8/2-MeTHF to ambient temperature for 30 min, a narrow distribution of spin systems with an \xe2\x80\x9caverage\xe2\x80\x9d S = 2.5 is obtained; upon a longer exposure time of 24 h, an \xe2\x80\x9caverage\xe2\x80\x9d S = 1 is produced.

"A series of mononuclear thio complexes of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl\xe2\x88\x92molybdenum(VI) and \xe2\x88\x92tungsten(VI) have been synthesized via C\xe2\x88\x92S bond-cleaving reactions of thiolates. Use of Li2S2 for sulfurization of Cp*MoCl4 resulted in the known dinuclear complex, anti-Cp*2Mo2(S)2(\xce\xbc-S)2 (1), while the analogous reaction of Cp*WCl4 gave rise to anti-Cp*2W2(S)2(\xce\xbc-S)2 (2) and (PPh4)[Cp*W(S)3] (3), the latter of which was isolated after the subsequent cation exchange reaction with PPh4Br. In contrast, the reaction of Cp*WCl4 with Li2edt (edt = SCH2CH2S) followed by treatment with PPh4Br generated 3 as the sole isolable product in high yield. A similar reaction between Cp*WCl4 and LiStBu afforded Cp*W(S)2(StBu) (6), which turned out to be thermally unstable in solution and gradually degraded to 2. In these reactions of Cp*WCl4 with lithium thiolates, a facile C\xe2\x88\x92S bond cleavage took place and the tungsten atom was oxidized from W(V) to W(VI). On the other hand, the Mo(IV) thiolate complexes, Cp*Mo(StBu)3 (4) and (PPh4)[Cp*Mo(edt)2] (5), were formed from the Cp*MoCl4/LiStBu and Cp*MoCl4/Li2edt/PPh4Br reaction systems. The complex 4 was readily oxidized by dry O2 producing Cp*Mo(O)2(StBu) (7) exclusively, while the reactions of 4 with NH2NMe2 and NH2NHPh occurred slowly to yield Cp*Mo(S)2(StBu) (8). The hydrazines acted as oxidants, presumably by cleaving the N\xe2\x88\x92N bond, and promoted the C\xe2\x88\x92S bond rupture of tert-butyl thiolate and concomitant oxidation of molybdenum from Mo(IV) to Mo(VI). Elemental sulfur S8 and grey selenium also acted as oxidants in the reactions with 4, leading to a complex mixture of products. From the 4 + S8 reaction, the complexes 1, 8, and Cp*Mo(O)(S)(StBu) (9) were produced, and the 4 + Se reaction lead to 8 and anti-Cp*2Mo2(E)2(\xce\xbc-E)2 (10; E = S, Se). Finally treatment of 8 with Li2S2 and PPh4Br afforded (PPh4)[Cp*Mo(S)3] (11). We found that 11 was synthesized more easily by a one-pot reaction of 4, 1/4 equiv of S8, and Li2S2 in THF. The trithio complexes, 3 and 11, reacted very cleanly with PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeCPh generating (PPh4)[Cp*M(S)(S2C2Ph2)] (M = W (12), Mo (13)), respectively. A kinetic study of these reactions showed that they were first order in PhC\xe2\x8b\xaeCPh and first order in 3 or 11 with appreciable negative entropies of activation and that the activation barrier was higher for the molybdenum reaction. The crystal structures of 3\xe2\x88\x928 and 11\xe2\x88\x9213 were determined by the X-ray analysis. "
"The first characterized amidinate complexes of Ge have been prepared using alkylamidinates as ancillary ligands. Spectroscopic and structural characterization of the two complexes, (CyNC(Me)NCy)2GeII (1) and (CyNC(tBu)NCy)2GeII (2) (Cy = cyclohexyl), revealed that the Ge coordination geometry is distorted tetrahedral in which one of the vertices is occupied by a lone pair of electrons. Both 1 and 2 exhibited one bidentate and one monodentate (\xe2\x80\x9cdangling\xe2\x80\x9d) ligand. Rapid oxidative addition of chalcogen atom sources (styrene sulfide and Se) to these complexes resulted in a series of rare terminal chalcogenido complexes with the formulas (CyNC(R)NCy)2GeCh [R = Me, Ch = S (3), Se(4); R = tBu, Ch = S (5), Se(6)]. The spectroscopic data and X-ray structure of 6 revealed a terminal GeSe complex. Mixed amidinato\xe2\x88\x92amido analogues were similarly obtained. For example, [(CyNC(R)NCy)GeII[N(SiMe3)2] (R = Me, tBu) react to yield the corresponding terminal chalcogenido complexes. In the case of [(CyNC(Me)NCy)GeII[N(SiMe3)2]Se (10), a crystallographic study confirmed the presence of a terminal GeSe bond. "

Reactions between appropriate enantiomers of 2 and 3 also yielded the remaining D3 isomers \xce\x9b\xce\x943-1, \xce\x94\xce\x9b3-1, and \xce\x9b\xce\x9b3-1 which collectively represent the highest nuclearity Ru oligomers based on bidentate type ligands prepared in a stereospecific fashion to give diasteromerically and enantiomerically pure products. The complexes were purified via cation-exchange HPLC. 1H and 13C NMR, COSY and HMQC NMR, and UV\xe2\x88\x92visible spectroscopy were employed to characterize these supramolecular assemblies. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry gave parent molecular ion peaks corresponding to the species m/z 2638 [1 \xe2\x88\x92 8PF6]+, 2783 [1 \xe2\x88\x92 7PF6]+, 2928 [1 \xe2\x88\x92 6PF6]+, 3073 [1 \xe2\x88\x92 5PF6]+, 3218 [1 \xe2\x88\x92 4PF6]+, and 3363 [M \xe2\x88\x92 3PF6]+, proving the macromolecular structure. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to determine the absolute stereochemistry and optical purity of each of these stereoisomers. "
"Unbridged PtIII dimers, cis- and trans-[PtCl3L2]2 (L = (E)-HNC(OMe)Me, cis-2 and trans-2), are formed, as transient species, in the oxidation with excess chlorine of the PtII compounds cis- and trans-[PtCl2L2] (cis-1 and trans-1) to the corresponding PtIV species, cis- and trans-[PtCl4L2] (cis-3 and trans-3). Complexes cis-2 and trans-2 are rather stable at low temperature (<0 and \xe2\x88\x9220 \xc2\xb0C for cis-2 and trans-2, respectively), while at higher temperature (20 \xc2\xb0C) they readily oxidize to PtIV (\xcf\x841/2 = 80 and 5 min for cis-2 and trans-2, respectively). The structures of the PtIII species have been solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The compounds are neutral dimers composed of two square-planar PtCl2L2 units perpendicularly connected by a Pt\xe2\x88\x92Pt bond and capped by axially coordinated chloride ligands. Bond distances and angles within the equatorial PtCl2L2 units are normal. The axial Pt\xe2\x88\x92Cl bond lengths are ca. 0.14 \xc3\x85 longer than the equatorial ones, indicating a strong trans influence of the intermetallic bond. The intermetallic bond distances are typical of either unbridged or pyrophosphite four-bridged PtIII dimers, while they are much longer than those found in other PtIII complexes with either two (>0.10 \xc3\x85) or four bridging ligands (>0.20 \xc3\x85). In cis-2, the iminoether ligands are in equivalent pairs, and a 90\xc2\xb0 rotation of one platinum subunit with respect to the other about the Pt\xe2\x88\x92Pt vector interchanges the ligand positions and converts the complex into its enantiomeric form. Both enantiomers are found in the crystal and in solution, where a \xce\x94G* of 16.9 \xc2\xb1 0.2 kcal mol-1 was calculated for the interconversion process (1H NMR). The formation of intermediate PtIII dimers appears to be a relatively common, although overlooked, feature of platinum chemistry. The oxidation of PtII to PtIV requires the removal of two electrons by the oxidant (an acid), assisted by a ligand (a base) entering the coordination sphere from the opposite side. A second PtII unit can act as a base contributing two dz2 electrons and binding face-to-face from the axial direction. The resulting dimer completes the coordination sphere of the adjoined platinum unit by binding an extra ligand. "
"Four compounds of the type Co3(dpa)4XYwhere X and Y are Cl or BF4 and dpa is the anion of dipyridylaminehave been prepared and structurally characterized. For X = Y = Cl, two significantly different types of complexes are formed. In one of them, Co3(dpa)4Cl2\xc2\xb7CH2Cl2, 1, there is only one crystallographically independent Co\xe2\x88\x92Co distance (2.3178(9) \xc3\x85). In the second type of crystal, a mononuclear Co(dpa)2 molecule is also found in the interstices of the crystal to give Co3(dpa)4Cl2\xc2\xb7Co(dpa)2, 2. Compound 2 has two independent and highly unsymmetrical Co\xe2\x88\x92Co separations (2.285(1) and 2.459(1) \xc3\x85) corresponding to a bonding and a nonbonding interaction. Reaction of 1 with 1 or 2 equiv of AgBF4 yields Co3(dpa)4Cl(BF4)\xc2\xb72CH2Cl2, 3, and Co3(dpa)4(BF4)2\xc2\xb72CH2Cl2, 4, respectively. Similarly to 2, compound 3 has a short and a long Co\xe2\x88\x92Co separation (2.277 and 2.504(2) \xc3\x85, respectively). However, 4 has independent but equal Co\xe2\x88\x92Co distances of 2.253[2] \xc3\x85, which are similar to that of 1. We propose that since compounds of 1 and 2 differ only in the composition of the interstitial molecules (CH2Cl2 and Co(dpa)2, respectively) but the Co\xe2\x88\x92Co bonding is so different, then the Co3(dpa)4Cl2 species should be considered as \xe2\x80\x9cstretch isomers\xe2\x80\x9d.

"Following an overview of the primitive state of mechanistic studies of the formation of nanoclusters, with a focus on LaMer\'s classic work on the formation of sulfur sols, kinetic and mechanistic studies of the formation of our recently reported novel P2W15Nb3O629- polyoxoanion- and Bu4N+- stabilized Ir\xe2\x88\xbc190-450 (hereafter, Ir(0)\xe2\x88\xbc300) nanoclusters are presented. The work reported consists of the full experimental and other details of the following eight major components:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) development of an indirectbut easy, continuous, highly quantitative and thus powerfulmethod to monitor the formation of the Ir(0) nanoclusters via their catalytic hydrogenation activity and through the concept of pseudoelementary reaction steps; (ii) application of the appropriate kinetic equations for nucleation and autocatalysis, and then demonstration that these equations fit the observed, sigmoidal-shaped kinetic curves quantitatively with resultant rate constants k1 and k2; (iii) confirmation by a more direct, GLC method that the method in (i) indeed works and does so quantitatively, yielding the same k1 and k2 values within experimental error; (iv) collection of a wealth of previously unavailable kinetic and mechanistic data on the effects on nanocluster formation of added olefin, H2 pressure, anionic nanocluster stabilizer ([Bu4N]9P2W15Nb3O62 in the present case), H2O, HOAc, and temperature; (v) careful consideration and ruling out of other hypotheses, notably that particle-size rate effects alone might account for the observed sigmoidal shaped curves; and then (vi) distillation of the results into a minimalistic mechanism consisting of several pseudoelementary steps. Also presented as part of the Discussion are (vii) a concise but comprehensive review of the literature of transition metal nanocluster formation under H2 as the reducing agent, an analysis which provides highly suggestive evidence that the new mechanism uncovered is a much more general mechanismif not a new paradigmfor transition metal nanoclusters formed under H2 (and, the data argue, probably also for related reducing agents); and (viii) a summary of the seven key predictions of this new mechanism which remain to be tested (four predictions are the expected predominance of magic-number size nanoclusters; designed control of nanocluster size via the living-metal polymer concept; the synthesis of onion-skin structure bi-, tri-, and higher-metallic nanoclusters; and the use of face-selective capping agents as a way to block the autocatalytic surface growth and, thereby, to provide designed-shape nanoclusters). Overall, it is hoped that the resultsthe first new mechanism in more than 45 years for transition metal nanocluster formationwill go far toward providing a firmer mechanistic basis, and perhaps even a new paradigm, for the designed synthesis of new transition metal nanoclusters of prechosen sizes, shapes, and mono- to multimetallic compositions.

"Complexes of 2,3\xe2\x80\x98-dicyanodiphenylacetylene (2,3\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA, 1), 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-dicyanodiphenylacetylene (2,2\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA, 2), and 2,4\xe2\x80\x98-dicyanodiphenylacetylene (2,4\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA, 3) with silver(I) salts have been characterized in the solid state by single-crystal X-ray analysis. In addition, aggregates of compounds 1\xe2\x88\x923 and silver(I) ions have been identified in solution by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The topology of the structures in the solid state, namely finite versus infinite, is found to depend on the substitution pattern of nitrile groups on diphenylacetylene. For 2,3\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA (1), crystallization with silver(I) triflate (AgCF3SO3), silver(I) perchlorate hydrate (AgClO4\xc2\xb7xH2O, x \xe2\x88\xbc 1), or silver(I) hexafluoroantimonate (AgSbF6) produces cyclic dimers of composition [Ag(1)(X)]2 (X = CF3SO3- (4) or ClO4- (5)) and {[Ag(1)](SbF6)}2 (6). For these structures, 2,3\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA coordinates to silver(I) ions in a cisoid conformation with respect to the orientation of nitrile groups. Significant deformations of the cyclic dimers are observed as a function of the counterion employed. In contrast to the finite structures involving 2,3\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA, crystallization of 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA (2) with AgCF3SO3 yields the infinite chain structure [Ag(2)(CF3SO3)] (7). 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA coordinates to silver(I) in a transoid conformation resulting in a \xe2\x80\x9chalf-bow-tie\xe2\x80\x9d motif for the chains. Crystallization of 2,4\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA (3) with AgCF3SO3 produces the infinite, undulating sheet structure [Ag(3)(CF3SO3)] (8) in which helical chains of 2,4\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA coordinated to silver(I) ions are bridged by triflate counterions. Positive ion ESI-MS of solutions of 2,3\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA (1) and AgCF3SO3, AgClO4\xc2\xb7H2O, or AgSbF6 in acetone or acetonitrile show a distribution of aggregates including [Ag2(1)2(X)]+ (X = CF3SO3-, ClO4-, or SbF6-). The composition of these species corresponds to that of the cyclic dimers of complexes 4\xe2\x88\x926 minus one counterion, X. With 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA (2) and AgCF3SO3 in acetone or acetonitrile, the aggregates [Ag(2)]+ and [Ag(2)2]+ are observed and higher adducts are noted to be present in much lower abundance. It is believed that the predominance of adducts involving one silver(I) ion is due to the formation of chelated species in solution in which 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA coordinates to a silver(I) ion in a cisoid conformation. Molecular modeling suggests that such species are viable. ESI-MS of 2,4\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA (3) and AgCF3SO3 in acetone or acetonitrile shows the existence of [Ag(3)]+ as well as higher aggregates which are less prevalent. For a given ligand, aggregation at concentrations of the ligand and silver(I) salt of ca. 10-3 M is significant in acetone, however, it is largely disrupted in acetonitrile due to the predominance of acetonitrile\xc2\xb7Ag(I) adducts. Analysis of the ESI-MS data for all three ligands with AgCF3SO3 in acetone or acetonitrile shows that the aggregate [Ag2(L)2(CF3SO3)]+ is most abundant for L = 2,3\xe2\x80\x98-DCPA (1). It is postulated that the relatively high abundance of [Ag2(1)2(CF3SO3)]+ is indicative of the formation of a cyclic dimer in solution that resembles complex 4. Similarly, it is believed that cyclic dimers exist in solution with ClO4- and SbF6- as well. "
"A novel expanded fulleride results from the room temperature reaction of Na2C60 with ammonia. The rhombohedral packing of (ND3)8Na2C60 arises from cooperative rearrangement of the face-centered cubic structure of the starting material, via a bcc intermediate.

"Using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), we demonstrate the direct observation of NO attached to the heme moiety in horse heart myoglobin (Mb) and in the \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-chains of human hemoglobin (Hb). It was found that a narrow range of ESI-MS conditions conspire to make observation of Fe\xe2\x88\x92NO interactions challenging, and this is presumably the reason why earlier attempts by other research groups to detect intact Fe\xe2\x88\x92NO products by mass spectrometry were unsuccessful. For Mb and Hb, mass shifts are observed that are consistent with NO modification of the hemoproteins. ESI mass spectra of the apoprotein portions of Mb and Hb in the presence of NO demonstrated the absence of NO modification of the polypeptide backbones. UV/vis spectra of both Mb/NO and Hb/NO solutions, recorded at the time of ESI-MS analysis, demonstrated hemoproteinII\xe2\x88\x92NO formation. To test the hypothesis that intact nitrosylated heme groups are observable by ESI-MS, a nitrosylated model metalloporphyrin was studied. The ESI mass spectrum of nitrosyl-\xce\xb1,\xce\xb2,\xce\xb3,\xce\xb4-tetraphenylporphinatoiron(II), [Fe(TPP)NO], showed peaks that were ascribed to [Fe(TPP)]+ and [Fe(TPP)NO]+. To test further our hypothesis that the hemoprotein\xe2\x88\x92NO peaks are due to heme nitrosylation and contain no significant contributions from NO modification of the polypeptide backbone, we determined the ESI-MS conditions necessary for observing S-nitrosation of Cys residues in Hb. Human Hb contains one Cys residue in Hb\xce\xb1 (Cys 104) and two Cys residues in Hb\xce\xb2, but only Hb\xce\xb2 Cys 93 is surface accessible. When metHb was incubated with S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP), the ESI mass spectrum revealed a single SNAP modification in both Hb\xce\xb2 and apoHb\xce\xb2. The ESI-MS conditions used for analyzing the Hb/SNAP solution were too harsh for observing intact heme nitrosylation, and thus, we ascribe the SNAP-modified Hb\xce\xb2 and apoHb\xce\xb2 peaks to S-nitrosation of Cys 93 in Hb\xce\xb2. Under appropriate denaturing sample conditions, it proved possible to S-nitrosate all three Cys residues in human apoHb. Our findings demonstrate that (once correct conditions are established) ESI-MS is a powerful tool for the detection of intact Fe\xe2\x88\x92NO interactions in proteins and porphyrins. "
"Hydrogen bond dissociation energies (\xce\x94H\xc2\xb0D) in protonated dimer ions containing isocyanides were measured by pulsed high-pressure mass spectrometry, and the interactions were analyzed by ab initio calculations. Strong bonding (80\xe2\x88\x92105 kJ/mol (19\xe2\x88\x9225 kcal/mol)) is observed when the carbon lone pair is the electron donor, i.e. in the complexes of isocyanides with protonated amines and protonated isocyanides (R3NH+\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7CNR and RNCH+\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7CNR complexes). The bonding is weaker (60\xe2\x88\x9290 kJ/mol (14\xe2\x88\x9221 kcal/mol)) in the complexes of oxygen bases with protonated isocyanides, i.e. in RNCH+\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O-type complexes. Inverse linear correlations between \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0D and the proton affinity difference of the components show slopes of \xe2\x88\x920.22 for R3NH+\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7CNR- and \xe2\x88\x920.25 for RNCH+\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O-type complexes. The intercepts yield intrinsic bond strengths (\xce\x94PA = 0) of 107.7 (25.7 kcal/mol) and 100.0 kJ/mol (23.9 kcal/mol), respectively. Geometry optimizations were carried out at four calculational levels, the largest of which is MP2/6-31+G(d,p). Single-point energies were obtained with increasingly flexible basis sets up to cc-pVTZ+. Trends in dissociation energies within the cyanide and isocyanide series of complexes and between the two series of complexes hold for every basis set considered. Calculated and experimental \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0D values agree within the standard uncertainty of \xc2\xb16 kJ/mol (1.5 kcal/mol) for only four of the nine complexes for which experimental data are available. The hydrogen bonding properties of sp-type carbon vs nitrogen lone pairs are illustrated by comparing analogous isocyanide and cyanide complexes. The relative importance of the electrostatic and delocalization components of the dissociation energy is different for the two sets of complexes, with delocalization effects being more important for the isocyanides.

"Formation of ML+ and ML2+ complexes of coronene was investigated with 25 atomic ions (M+) in the low-pressure gas-phase environment of the Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) ion trapping mass spectrometer. All of the atomic ions formed M+(Cor) except the alkalis (and also excepting a few cases which were dominated by charge transfer). All the other cases reacted with large, collisionally saturated rates, implying bond strengths >35 kcal mol-1, except for the larger alkaline earths Sr+ and Ba+, whose noticeably slower rates were attributed to relatively lower bond strengths around 32 kcal mol-1. Many of the M+(Cor) complexes reacted further to M+(Cor)2 with collisionally saturated rates, but several cases (Mg+, Al+, Si+, In+, Pb+, Bi+) reacted more slowly or not at all, indicating weaker bonds. The important role of transition-metal character in M+(Cor)2 bonding is suggested by the observation that transition metal ions (Sc+ and Mn+, for instance) rapidly formed M+(Cor)2 complexes, while comparable non-transition ions (Mg+, Al+, Si+) did so poorly or not at all. The rates of formation of the various complexes were interpreted to estimate ion\xe2\x88\x92neutral bond strengths, or at least to give upper or lower limits to the bond strengths. Atomic-ion/benzene bond strengths were generally well correlated in a qualitative way with the observed patterns of formation of ion/coronene complexes. Comparison with the isomeric ligand tribenzocyclyne (TBC) supports the interpretation that small ions (Ni+, Cu+) partially insert into the cavity of TBC, resulting in inhibited ML2+ formation relative to coronene.

"The mid-infrared (4000\xe2\x88\x92400 cm-1) spectra of ethene/BF3 and propene/BF3 mixtures, dissolved in liquid argon (93\xe2\x88\x92125K) and in liquid nitrogen (80\xe2\x88\x92118K) are discussed. In all spectra, the formation of a 1:1 van der Waals complex, in which the electron deficient BF3 molecule binds to the CC double bond, was observed. Using spectra recorded at different temperatures, the complexation enthalpy \xce\x94Ho for ethene\xc2\xb7BF3 was determined to be \xe2\x88\x9210.0 \xc2\xb1 0.2 kJ mol-1 in liquid argon and \xe2\x88\x925.4 \xc2\xb1 0.3 kJ mol-1 in liquid nitrogen, while for propene\xc2\xb7BF3 the \xce\x94Ho are \xe2\x88\x9211.8 \xc2\xb1 0.2 and \xe2\x88\x926.9 \xc2\xb1 0.3 kJ mol-1, respectively.

Unimolecular electrical rectification by monolayers of 5 is unequivocally confirmed. "
"Antigen monolayers assembled onto Au-electrodes or Au-electrodes associated with quartz crystals act as active interfaces for the amperometric or microgravimetric analysis of the complementary antibody and provide the grounds for the development of electrochemical and piezoelectric immunosensors. The antigen monolayer of N\xce\xb5-2,4-dinitrophenyl-l-lysine is assembled on an electrode. The anti-dinitrophenyl antibody, anti-DNP-Ab, is sensed by the antigen monolayer, and the formation of the antigen\xe2\x88\x92antibody complex at the monolayer interface is probed by the insulation of the electrode toward a redox probe in the electrolyte solution. The formation of the antibody\xe2\x88\x92antigen complex is amplified by the application of the anti-antibody or the use of a ferrocene-functionalized redox-enzyme, glucose oxidase, as redox probe. A 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid antigen monolayer bound to Au-electrodes associated with a quartz crystal is used as active interface for the microgravimetric, quartz-crystal-microbalance analysis of the anti-DNP-Ab. Photoisomerizable antigen monolayer electrodes provide the basis for tailoring reversible immunosensors. The dinitrospiropyran monolayer, SP-state, is assembled on Au-electrodes or quartz crystals. The monolayer exhibits reversible photoisomerizable features, and irradiation of the SP-monolayer, 360 < \xce\xbb < 380 nm, yields the protonated merocyanine monolayer, MRH+-state. Further irradiation of the MRH+-monolayer electrode, \xce\xbb > 495 nm, restores the SP-monolayer electrode. The SP-monolayer acts as antigen for anti-DNP-Ab, whereas the MRH+-monolayer lacks antigen properties for anti-DNP-Ab. This enables the amperometric or piezoelectric transduction of the formation of the antigen\xe2\x88\x92anti-DNP-Ab complex at the SP-monolayer interface. By photoisomerization of the monolayer to the MRH+-state, the Ab is washed-off from the sensing interface. Subsequent light-induced isomerization of the monolayer to the SP-state regenerates the electrochemically or piezoelectrically active sensing interfaces. "

Although the magnitudes of the principal elements of the 1H and 15N chemical shift tensors for these two sites are quite different, their molecular orientations in the molecular frame are very similar. The least shielded 15N chemical shift tensor element, \xcf\x8333N, and the most shielded 1H chemical shift tensor element, \xcf\x8311H, are approximately colinear with the N\xe2\x88\x92H bond in both cases. The principal elements, \xcf\x8322H and \xcf\x8322N, are in the plane of the indole ring for tryptophan and in the plane of the imidazole ring for histidine but oppose each other. \xcf\x8311N and \xcf\x8333H are perpendicular to the planes of these heterocyclic rings. The chemical shift tensors of the 1H and 15N nuclei in these two side chain nitrogen sites are distinctly different from those of backbone amide nitrogen sites. "
"The \xce\xb2-amyloid proteins (A\xce\xb2), especially the variant A\xce\xb21\xe2\x88\x9242, are the primary constituent of the amyloid plaques which are characteristic of Alzheimer\'s disease (AD). The C-terminus of A\xce\xb2 has been identified as crucial for rapid amyloid formation. A 9-residue C-terminal fragment of A\xce\xb2 (designated \xce\xb234\xe2\x88\x9242, with sequence LMVGGVVIA) forms a structured aggregate which is classified as an amyloid fibril based primarily on its morphological and solubility properties and the classic cross-\xce\xb2 fiber diffraction pattern it displays. We have adopted this aggregate as a model of the A\xce\xb2-dominated amyloid plaques associated with AD. Previous results from a series of internuclear 13C\xe2\x88\x9213C distance measurements along the peptide backbone indicate that the \xce\xb234\xe2\x88\x9242 backbone conformation differs considerably from that of the classic \xce\xb2-sheet, possibly including an unusual cis amide bond in the peptide\'s central glycyl\xe2\x88\x92glycyl region. Here we report evidence which demonstrates the presence of a trans configuration at the peptide linkage between these residues. The evidence derives from solid-state NMR static echo and n = 2 rotational resonance experiments which probe the orientation of the 13C carbonyl chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) tensor of the peptide bond with respect to the dipolar tensor connecting the carbonyl carbon to the 13C-labeled \xce\xb1-carbon on the succeeding residue.

"Solid-phase peptide synthesis of certain sequences (commonly called \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult sequences\xe2\x80\x9d) suffers from the occurrence of incomplete coupling reactions and/or partial unmaskings of N\xce\xb1-protection. The underlying reasons for these problems are thought to be a structuration and/or a poor solvation of the growing peptide chains. Few methods are available to study the structural aspects of the peptide chains when still anchored to the solid support. In most cases, they rely on the incorporation of a specific label and examine therefore a modified peptide analog. We describe the complete characterization by homonuclear and heteronuclear magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) of the solid-phase synthesis of a 10-residue peptide. A detailed secondary structure determination of the growing peptide on the resin beads, based on the NOE analysis and the 1H and 13C chemical shift deviations, indicated an extended structure on the whole length of the sequence. At critical synthesis steps, a correlation between the coupling difficulties and the aggregation of the peptide chains was established by chemical measurements and MAS NMR. Upon titration with the hydrogen bond-accepting solvent DMSO, the mobility of the peptide chains on the resin beads increased, resulting in a significant line narrowing of the MAS NMR spectra. This increased mobility is linked to an enhanced peptidyl-resin solvation as reflected by the better coupling efficiency at the critical synthesis steps. "
"The solvation of the Li+\xe2\x88\x92Br-\xe2\x88\x92Li+ triple ion with oxygen-donor Lewis bases was studied in the gas phase with use of Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance spectrometry. The Li+\xe2\x88\x92Br-\xe2\x88\x92Li+ triple ions were prepared in an ICR cell by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization of a lithium bromide/dibenzo-18-crown-6-ether matrix pasted on a Teflon substrate. The stepwise solvations of LiBrLi+ were examined with oxygen-containing Lewis bases:\xe2\x80\x89 15-crown-5-ether (15C5), 12-crown-4-ether (12C4), 1,4-dioxane, 1,3-dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Crown ethers solvate Li+ with loss of LiBr. 15-Crown-5-ether yields a 1:1 (15C5)\xc2\xb7Li+ complex as the end product, whereas 12-crown-4-ether forms a 2:1 (12C4)2\xc2\xb7Li+ complex. On the other hand, low dielectric constant solvents, such as dioxanes and THF, solvate the Li+\xe2\x88\x92Br-\xe2\x88\x92Li+ triple ion rather than abstracting Li+ with loss of the neutral ion pair. The maximum coordination numbers are 3 for dioxanes and 4 for THF at 293 K. The rate constants for the stepwise solvations were measured, and the binding energies were determined from the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constants. The mechanisms of stepwise solvations are discussed in light of the structures and energetics of the 1:1 complexes of Li+ and LiBrLi+ with dioxanes and THF calculated at the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock level with a standard 6-311G(d,p) basis set.

"4D-QSAR analysis incorporates conformational and alignment freedom into the development of 3D-QSAR models for training sets of structure\xe2\x88\x92activity data by performing ensemble averaging, the fourth \xe2\x80\x9cdimension\xe2\x80\x9d. The descriptors in 4D-QSAR analysis are the grid cell (spatial) occupancy measures of the atoms composing each molecule in the training set realized from the sampling of conformation and alignment spaces. Grid cell occupancy descriptors can be generated for any atom type, group, and/or model pharmacophore. A single \xe2\x80\x9cactive\xe2\x80\x9d conformation can be postulated for each compound in the training set and combined with the optimal alignment for use in other molecular design applications including other 3D-QSAR methods. The influence of the conformational entropy of each compound on its activity can be estimated. Serial use of partial least-squares, PLS, regression and a genetic algorithm, GA, is used to perform data reduction and identify the manifold of top 3D-QSAR models for a training set. The unique manifold of 3D-QSAR models is arrived at by computing the extent of orthogonality in the residuals of error among the most significant 3D-QSAR models in the general GA population. Receptor independent (RI) 4D-QSAR analysis has been successfully applied to three training sets:\xe2\x80\x89 (a) benzylpyrimidine inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase, (b) prostaglandin PGF2\xce\xb1 antinidatory analogs, and, (c) dipyridodiazepinone inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Two general findings from these applications are that grid cell occupancy descriptors associated with the \xe2\x80\x9cconstant\xe2\x80\x9d chemical structure of an analog series can be significant in the 3D-QSAR models and that there is an enormous data reduction in constructing 3D-QSAR models. The resultant 3D-QSAR models can be graphically represented by plotting the significant 3D-QSAR grid cells in space along with their descriptor attributes. "
"The effect of oxygen on the electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) of the ruthenium trisbipyridyl\xe2\x88\x92viologen complexes (4,4\xe2\x80\x98-R2-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine)2Ru(1-(4-methyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridin-4\xe2\x80\x98-yl-(CH2)n-4,4\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridindiium-1\xe2\x80\x98-methyl)4+ (n = 1, 2, 3, 5, or 8; R = H or Me) has been investigated. This light emission is shown to occur not from a MLCT excited state localized on an unsubstituted bipyridine ligand as had been previously proposed, but from decomposition products formed during the ECL experiments when trace amounts of oxygen are present. These ECL-active species are generated when oxygen reduction products react with the pendant viologen to alter or remove this ligand, thereby disabling the electron-transfer quenching of the excited state by the intact viologen. Electrolysis and extended ECL experiments with methylviologen and the ruthenium-linked viologen compounds verify that a number of products are formed under ECL conditions when oxygen is present in solution. Some of these products have been identified. "
"The kinetics and energetics of the electron transfer reactions occurring in the enzyme\xc2\xb7substrate complex of DNA photolyase have been studied by transient absorption spectroscopy with picosecond time resolution in the temperature range 275\xe2\x88\x9290 K. The results can be summarized as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) The lifetime of 1(FADH-)* depends not only on the presence of the substrate but also on its nature, e.g. the electron transfer from 1(FADH-)* to thymine dimers T<>T and to thymine-uracil dimers T<>U is slower by a factor of 2 to 3 compared to that of U<>U and U<>T. This feature is attributed to the enlarged electronic coupling between 1(FADH-)* and the respective dimers in the absence of the methyl group in the C5 position of the 5\xe2\x80\x98-uracil. (ii) The temperature dependence of the quantum yield was studied, and from this the activation energy for the overall repair process has been estimated to be EA= 0.45 \xc2\xb1 0.1 eV. "
"Replication of the functionality and isolation provided by enzyme active sites is an important goal in the creation of effective models. To provide both of these attributes, we have covalently incorporated flavin mononucleotide (FMN) into a silicate matrix using the sol-gel process. In these sol-gels, the isolation provided by the cybotactic region of the silicate replicates the sequestered nature of an enzyme active site. Specific hydrogen bonding recognition of the flavin within the sol-gel matrix was then established via doping with diacyl diaminopyridine 3. The presence, specificity, and magnitude of this host\xe2\x88\x92guest interaction was established via quenching of the flavin fluorophore by receptor 3. "
"We performed fluorescence microscopic observation of the conformational change of individual T4DNAs (166 kbp) induced by Fe2+/Fe3+. Individual DNAs undergo a marked discrete transition from an elongated coil into a collapsed globule with an increase in the Fe3+ concentration at around 1\xe2\x88\x922 \xce\xbcM. On the other hand, DNAs remained in the elongated coil state with the addition of Fe2+ up to a concentration of 30 \xce\xbcM. Using these experimental results we tried to control the transition of DNA by the redox reaction of Fe2+/Fe3+. We found that collapsed globule DNA unfolds with the reduction of Fe3+. The results have been analyzed theoretically in terms of the double minima in the free energy profile of a single DNA molecule, indicating that the change in the translational entropy of the counterions is the main reason why high-valency ions are more effective in inducing the collapse.

"The 2-amino-3-oxohexahydroindolizino[8,7-b]indole-5-carboxylate system (IBTM) has been proposed as a dipeptide surrogate of type II\xe2\x80\x98 \xce\xb2-turns. To evaluate which of the 11bR and 11bS diastereomers of IBTM best reproduces the conformational properties of type II\xe2\x80\x98 \xce\xb2-turns, gramicidin S (GS), a cyclic antibiotic peptide that contains two such units, has been chosen as a test compound and the effect of either diastereomer on both conformation and activity of the resulting peptide analogues has been determined. A conventional approach to the cyclic peptide structure based on solution cyclization of a partially protected precursor was only practicable for the (S)-IBTM diastereomer. As an alternative, a solid phase mediated cyclization approach has been devised and applied successfully to both gramicidin S and its Lys2,2\xe2\x80\x98 analogue, then extended to the (R)-IBTM-containing analogues. NMR conformational analysis has clearly shown that only the (R) diastereomer of IBTM is a suitable mimic of the type II\xe2\x80\x98 \xce\xb2-turn conformation typical of GS. Differences in antibacterial activity between the (S)- and (R)-IBTM-containing GS analogues confirm the conformational results. "
"Anthranilamide derivatives are used as the basis for a series of novel oligomers that fold into helical secondary structures in the solid state. When combined with pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid and 4,6-dimethoxy-1,3-diaminobenzene subunits, oligoanthranilamides can be induced to take up a coiled conformation corresponding to two turns of a helix. X-ray crystallography shows that intramolecular hydrogen bonding and \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 stacking interactions are important in stabilizing the extended helical structures. Furthermore, both experimental and calculated 1H NMR methods indicate that related conformations are taken up by the oligomers in chloroform solution. "
"The hydroxylation of cycloalkanes at 25 \xc2\xb0C by the syringe pump addition of tert-alkyl hydroperoxides (10 and 1 equiv based on catalyst) to deoxygenated acetonitrile containing cycloalkanes (0.64 M) and 0.61 mM of the catalyst, [FeIII2O(TPA)2(H2O)2]4+, is demonstrated to be a reaction which involves freely diffusing cycloalkyl radicals, i.e., free alkyl radicals.

"The conformations of azacyclodeca-3,8-diyne (4a) and its N-methyl (4b) and N-isopropyl (4c) derivatives as well as 1,6-diazacyclodeca-3,8-diyne (5a) and its 1,6-dimethyl (5b), 1,6-diisopropyl (5c), 1,6-di-tert-butyl (5d), and 1,6-ditolyl (5e) derivatives have been investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in solution by NMR and by theoretical methods. In the solid state, 4a,c and 5a\xe2\x88\x92e adopt a chair conformation with the substituents in the bis-axial positions. In solution 4 and 5 show \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 10.4 and 11.0 kcal/mol, respectively, for ring inversion. Trapping of 5c with HCl indicates the presence of bis-axial, axial, and equatorial conformations in solution. The equilibrium between boat and chair conformations in 4 and 5 is ascribed to much reduced torsional strain between the propargylic hydrogens. The preference of the axial orientation of the substituents on the nitrogen atom(s) in 4 and 5 is interpreted in terms of the vicinal interactions of both the NR bond and the lone pair with the adjacent CH and CC bonds, synaxial 1,3-interactions of both the NR bond and the lone pair, and secondary interactions of CH/CC bonds of the alkyl substituent with the endocyclic CH2 groups as well as with triple bonds (back and front strain).

"Near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) and scanning force microscopy have been employed to spatially resolve the complex morphologies, spectroscopy, and charge transfer induced fluorescence quenching efficiencies of a (perylene phenethylimide)/(titanyl phthalocyanine) bilayer (PPEI/TiOPc). The PPEI/TiOPc bilayer is a typical example of a n-like/p-like molecular semiconductor heterojunction, which is a common component in photocells, LEDs, and other devices. NSOM-polarized fluorescence and transmission dataand separate bulk X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic measurementson PPEI/TiOPc bilayers and PPEI and TiOPc single layers has lead to a nanoscopic and mesoscopic picture of how vacuum deposition and subsequent solvent-vapor-annealing controls the local structure of these films. The layers and bilayers are highly organized, containing localized crystalline regions which are preferentially oriented relative to the substrate and PPEI/TiOPc interface. In highly annealed bilayers, only a small fraction of the area of the interface makes good contact between the bilayers, and the contact regions are less than 100 nm2 in most cases. The consequences of the observed morphology on the charge separation efficiencies at the interface is examined. It is shown that exciton migration both perpendicular and parallel to the molecular interface are involved in the charge separation mechanism. Extended methylene chloride, solvent-vapor-annealing of PPEI films produces long needle-like PPEI crystals with a range of sizes, as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 width (50\xe2\x88\x92200 nm), length (1000\xe2\x88\x922000 nm), and height (50\xe2\x88\x92200 nm). Annealing of the TiOPc yields nanocrystallites that are preferentially oriented relative to the interface with a height in the range of 10\xe2\x88\x92100 nm and widths in the range of <10 nm to 30 nm.

"We present the first examples of ab initio calculations of electron transition current density (TCD) for vibrational transitions in molecules. The non-Born\xe2\x88\x92Oppenheimer (non-BO) theoretical expressions for TCD, derived in the first paper in this series, are implemented at the ab initio level for the 6 vibrational transitions of formaldehyde and the 12 vibrational transitions of ethylene. Vector field calculations of the TCD were carried out with 6-31G(d) and larger basis sets and displayed with the AVS visualization software program package. TCDs for vibrational transitions arise from the non-BO correlation of electron current density to nuclear velocities. The formalism used to express this correlation is the complete adiabatic approximation in which the electronic wave function carries an explicit dependence on the nuclear velocities as well as the usual dependence on positions. Vibrational TCDs provide a unique, unambiguous visualization of electronic motion in molecules that accompanies the vibrational nuclear motion. Patterns of calculated TCD in formaldehyde and ethylene are analyzed in terms of their group theoretical properties and allowed multipole transitions. Two principal classes of TCD motion are observed. One is motion that reflects linear, laminar current densities that lead to changes in electron probability density in response to nuclear displacements. A second is circulatory motion of TCD about atomic centers that appears be associated primarily with the lateral motion of two adjacent atomic centers. The latter motion does not lead to changes in electron probability density, but gives rise to magnetic dipole moments, and is likely important in the generation of vibrational circular dichroism intensity.

"Many organisms contain proteins which regulate the size and shape of inorganic crystals in their skeletal elements, most likely through specific protein\xe2\x88\x92crystal surface interactions. As a model for better understanding such control of crystal morphology, an \xce\xb1-helical peptide (CBP1) was synthesized having an array of aspartyl residues designed to bind to the {11\xcc\x840} prism faces of calcite. When added to a saturated solution of calcium bicarbonate containing rhombohedral calcite seed crystals, CBP1 had a remarkable effect on subsequent calcite growth, depending on growth conditions. At 3 \xc2\xb0C, where CBP1 is 89% helical, the crystals assumed a prismatic habit, with growth continuing along the c-axis, but inhibited parallel to the c-axis and prism faces; at 25 \xc2\xb0C, where CBP1 is largely unstructured, studded crystals formed, resulting from epitaxial growth off each of the six rhombohedral surfaces. Other acidic peptides also caused similar epitaxial growth. These results suggest that the helical form of the peptide recognizes specific crystal surface characteristics, whereas the unfolded form acts nonspecifically as a polyanion. When the peptide was removed from the growth medium containing either type of crystal, regrowth of {104} rhombohedral surfaces ensued at the expense of the nonrhombohedral surfaces. These results represent the first example of conformation-dependent control of calcite crystal growth by a peptide of defined secondary structure. "
"Racemic perhydrotriphenylene (PHTP) forms a polar inclusion compound with 1-(4-nitrophenyl)piperazine (NPP) as a guest molecule. Homochiral stacks of PHTP molecules surround polar chains of hydrogen-bonded NPP molecules in a channel-type, honeycomb architecture. The NPP chains are arranged in an all-parallel (rather than an antiparallel) fashion. Crystals of [PHTP]5[NPP] show second harmonic generation for incident light of wavelength 1064 nm, an electro-optical and a pyroelectric effect. The X-ray diffraction pattern exhibits Bragg-like reflections, interspersed with planes of diffuse scattering and weak satellite reflections superimposed on these planes, features which are indicative of extensive disorder. In spite of this, an orthorhombic average structure model could be deduced from the Bragg-like reflections (space group Cmc21, a = 15.023(2), b = 23.198(2), and c = 4.730(1) \xc3\x85 (T = 100 K), wR2 = 0.088, goodness of fit 1.38). A qualitative interpretation of diffuse and satelite scattering is given. Crystals of [PHTP]5[NPP] are approximately hexagonal prisms. If the tailor-made additive 1-(p-tolyl)piperazine (TP) is present during crystallization, the habit changes to approximately hexagonal plates and TP is incorporated in small amounts. Crystals of the composition [PHTP]5[NPP]0.93[TP]0.07 lose the ability of second harmonic generation. The observation of polar properties for a crystal structure whose polar building blocks, the -NO2\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7HN- hydrogen-bonded NPP chains, are 14\xe2\x88\x9215 \xc3\x85 apart and separated by PHTP hydrocarbon molecules is surprising, but can be explained in terms of a Markov chain model of crystal growth. The same simple model accounts for the loss of polarity in the presence of the tailor-made additive TP. The knowledge gained during the present analysis provides a rational tool for the engineering of polar properties of PHTP and similar channel-type inclusion compounds. "
"The (9-anthracenyl)methylammonium and (9-anthracenyl)benzylammonium tetrakis(hexafluorophosphate) salts give hydrogen-bonded complexes in CH2Cl2 with aromatic crown ethers containing dibenzo (DB) or dinaphtho (DN) units. The association constants vary from 3 \xc3\x97 103 to 1 \xc3\x97 106 M-1 in CH2Cl2, depending on the specific ammonium cation and crown ether involved. In a number of cases, pseudorotaxane-like geometries for the complexes are demonstrated by (a) 1H NMR spectroscopy in solution, (b) X-ray crystallography in the solid state, and (c) mass spectrometry in the gas phase. The results obtained by absorption, emission, and excitation spectroscopy and excited lifetimes show that, as a consequence of the hydrogen bond driven recognition process, the anthracene chromophoric unit interacts with the aromatic units of the crown ethers. In the complexes involving the DB18C6, DB24C8, and DB30C10 macrocycles, the interaction leads to the complete quenching of the fluorescence of the dialkoxybenzene moieties and parallels sensitization of the anthracene fluorescence. In the complexes of 1/5-DN38C10, both the crown and the anthracene fluorescence are completely quenched, most likely by an energy-transfer cascade involving the triplet state of the dialkoxynaphthalene moiety. In the complexes of 2/3-DN30C10, the interaction between the anthracene moiety and the naphthalene rings of the crown ether is relatively strong, as indicated by the perturbation of the absorption bands, the disappearance of the fluorescence bands of the naphthalene- and anthracene-type chromophoric units, and the appearance of a new, broad fluorescence band. The complexes can also be formed by addition of CF3COOH or CF3SO3H to CH2Cl2 solutions containing crown ether and amine. The association process between DB24C8 and (9-anthracenyl)benzylammonium salt can be reversed quantitatively upon addition of a suitable base and the complex can be formed again after treatment with acid.

"The dynamics of reactions of carbon-centered 1-arylalkyl radicals with bromine or chlorine attached to the carbon adjacent (\xce\xb2) to the radical center have been examined using nanosecond laser flash photolysis. The primary reaction of the radicals containing the electron-donating 4-methoxy group on the phenyl ring is highly dependent on the solvent composition. In weakly ionizing solvents such as acetonitrile, the radicals decay in a second-order manner indicating that coupling of two radical centers is the primary mode of radical decay. However, when the ionizing ability of the solvent is increased by addition of water, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP), or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), heterolysis of the \xce\xb2-substituent becomes the dominant mode of decay. The occurrence of the heterolysis reaction is demonstrated unambiguously by direct observation of the radical cation produced as the primary, heterolysis product. The rate constants for and yield of the heterolysis reaction are found to be dependent on both the solvent ionizing ability and radical structure. In neat water or neat HFIP the reactions become extremely fast and occur with rate constants in the 107 s-1 to \xe2\x89\xa5 108 s-1 range. For the \xce\xb2-bromophenethyl and \xce\xb2-bromo-4-methyphenethyl radicals, no heterolysis is observed even under strongly ionizing conditions, indicating that the rate constant for ionization is strongly influenced by the substituent on the phenyl ring. For radicals with an additional \xce\xb2-phenyl substituent, rapid heterolysis takes place leading to the formation of the stilbene radical cation. The formation of a radical/radical cation equilibrium was observed under the appropriate conditions only for the 4-methoxyphenethyl radical derivatives. "
"The photochemistry of p-benzoquinone diazide carboxylic acids (7) was studied using matrix isolation spectroscopy, product analysis, and high-level ab initio molecular orbital theory. The general photochemical pathway observed includes primary carbene formation, followed by secondary photodecarboxylation to yield derivatives of 2,4-didehydrophenol 9. CCSD(T) calculations on the parent 2,4-didehydrophenol (9a) lead to an infrared spectrum which is in excellent agreement with the experimental one. Furthermore, calculations predict 9a to be characterized by a distorted benzene ring with the hydroxy group pointing toward the radical center in ortho position. The heat of formation of 9a is predicted to be 85 kcal/mol. Its formation from 1-oxo-2,5-cyclohexadien-4-ylidene-2-carboxylic acid (8a) by decarboxylation is exothermic by 30 kcal/mol where strong H-bonding in 8a can be considered to facilitate the formation of 9a.

"The radical cations of cyclopentane- and urazole-annelated azoalkanes and housanes were generated by pulse radiolysis and the transients characterized spectrally and kinetically by time-resolved optical monitoring. For the bridgehead-substituted diphenyl derivatives of the cyclopentane-annelated azoalkane 1 and housane 2 only the corresponding proximate 1,2 radical cation species were observed, generated from the initially formed and too short-lived (<1 \xce\xbcs) distonic 1,3 radical cation by 1,2-methyl migration. In contrast, for the corresponding urazole-annelated azoalkanes 4, the initial distonic 1,3 radical cations 5\xe2\x80\xa2+ were detected, and of these the methyl-substituted 5b\xe2\x80\xa2+deprotonates to the radical 5b\xe2\x80\xa2.

"The photocyclization reactions of 2-halopyridinium salt tethered to arene have been studied. The photocyclization of 2-halophenethylpyridinium salts produced a six-membered heterocyclic product, pyrido[2,1-a]-3H,4H-isoquinolinium salt. The 2-halopyridinium salts tethered to phenyl group with methylene linkage (1 and 2a) are more reactive than the 2-halopyridinium salts with an ethylene group (3 and 4a). As expected, the 2-bromopyridinium salt linked to the phenyl group with ethylene linkage (4a) is more reactive than the 2-chloropyridinium salt with the ethylene group (3), which is different from the 2-halopyridinium salt with the methylene linkage. The transient intermediates such as pyridinium salt \xcf\x83, 2,3-dihydrocyclohexadienyl radicals, and a dibromide radical anion are detected with laser flash photolysis facility. The maximum absorption wavelengths of the pyridinium salt \xcf\x83, 2,3-dihydrocyclohexadienyl radicals, and dibromide radical anion are 250, 310, and 360 nm, respectively. The lifetimes of the pyridinium salt \xcf\x83, 2,3-dihydrocyclohexadienyl radicals, and dibromide radical anion are 0.93 ms, 0.84 ms, and 25 \xce\xbcs, respectively. Thus, a photohomolytic radical mechanism is proposed for the cyclization reaction. The excited singlet state is mainly involved in the photocyclization of 2-halopyridinium salts tethered to phenyl group with ethylene linkage (3 and 4a), while both the singlet and triplet states are involved in the photocyclization of the 2-halopyridinium salts with methylene linkage (1 and 2a).

"The synthesis and spectroscopic properties of a series of soluble octaalkoxy-substituted silicon phthalocyanine monomers, (RO)8PcSi(OSiMe2tBu)L, and \xce\xbc-oxo-bridged dimers, [(RO)8PcSi(OSiMe2tBu)]2O (R = H17C8-, H25C12-, (\xc2\xb1)-3,7-Me2-C8H15-, (\xc2\xb1)-2-Et-C6H12-; L = -OSiMe2tBu, -OSiMe3, -F, -OH), are reported. The optical absorption spectra of all dimers show strong solvatochromic behavior whereas the monomers do not. In nonaromatic solvents like, e.g., dichloromethane, the Q-band of the dimers is split into at least five broad bands between 560 and 760 nm, and proton NMR spectra show a strong splitting (\xce\x94\xce\xb4 = 1 ppm) of the aromatic signal at low temperature, indicating a torsion angle of \xe2\x88\xbc20\xe2\x88\x9230\xc2\xb0 between the rings. In aromatic solvents such as, e.g., benzene, toluene, or 1-methylnaphthalene, thermochromism of the dimers is observed. This is shown by temperature-dependent optical absorption spectroscopy to be due to the presence of a second isomer exclusively found in solutions of aromatic solvents. It shows a rather different absorption spectrum with a very intense and sharp Q-band at 639 nm, a weak shoulder at \xe2\x88\xbc670 nm, and a very broad and weak absorption at \xe2\x88\xbc830 nm. Proton NMR spectra of this isomer show, even at \xe2\x88\x9288 \xc2\xb0C, only one signal for the aromatic protons, demonstrating a fully staggered or eclipsed conformation of the two rings. The ratio between the two isomers is dependent on the nature and concentration of the aromatic solvent molecules and the steric demand of the alkyl chains R attached to the macrocycle. The assignment of the absorption bands in both isomers is discussed in relation to exciton coupling theory and inter-ring \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80 interactions between the aromatic solvent and the macrocycles, which are likely to account also for the strong aromatic solvent-induced NMR shifts (ASIS) observed for the monomers as well as for the dimers.

"Addition of 2.0 equiv of Na(silox) to TiCl4(THF)2 afforded (silox)2TiCl2 (1), which yielded (silox)2(tBu3SiNH)TiCl (2-Cl) upon treatment with tBu3SiNLi. Grignard or alkyllithium additions to 2-Cl or 1,2-RH-addition to transient (silox)2TiNSitBu3 (3) produced (silox)2(tBu3SiNH)TiR (2-R; R = Me, Et, CH2Ph = Bz, CHCH2 = Vy, cBu, nBu, Ph, H, cPr, cPe, CH2-3,5-Me2C6H3 = Mes, neoHex, cHex, \xce\xb73-H2CHCH2, \xce\xb73-H2CCHCHMe). Insertions of C2H4, butadiene, HC2H, and HC2tBu into the titanium\xe2\x88\x92hydride bond of 2-H generated (silox)2(tBu3SiNH)TiR (2-R; R = Et, \xce\xb73-H2CCHCHMe, Vy, E-CHCHtBu).

Kinetics data, large 1,2-RH/D-elimination KIE\'s (e.g., MeH/D, 13.7(9), 24.8 \xc2\xb0C), and Eyring parameters (e.g., 2-Me, \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 20.2(12) kcal/mol, \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9212(4) eu) portray a four-center, concerted transition state where the N\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7R linkage is nearly linear. Equilibrium measurements led to the following relative standard free energy scale:\xe2\x80\x89 2-cHex > 2-cPe > 2-nPr \xe2\x88\xbc 2-nBu > 2-neoHex > 2-Et > 2-cBu > 2-CH2SiMe3 > 2-Ph > 2-Me > 2-Bz > 2-cPr \xe2\x88\xbc 2-Mes > 2-Vy > 3-C2H4 > 3-NEt3 > 2-H > 3-OEt2 > 3-EtC2Et >3-MeC2Me > 3-THF > 3-NMe3 > 3-PMe3 > 3-py. A correlation of D(TiR)rel to D(RH) revealed greater differences in titanium\xe2\x88\x92carbon bond energies. THF loss from 3-THF allowed a rough estimate of \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0(3). Using thermochemical cycles, relative activation energies for 1,2-RH-addition were assessed:\xe2\x80\x89 cHexH > cPeH > nBuH > neoHexH > EtH > BzH > cBuH > MesH > MeH > PhH > cPrH > VyH > 3-C2H4 formation > H2. On the basis of a parabolic model, C\xe2\x88\x92H bond activation selectivities are influenced by the relative ground state energies of 2-R and a parameter representing the reaction coordinate. A more compressed reaction coordinate for sp2- vs sp3-substrates eases their activation. "
"In the natural photosynthetic reaction center photosystem II, absorption of a photon leads to photooxidation of the primary electron donor P680, which subsequently retrieves electrons from a tyrosyl residue, functioning as an interface to the oxygen-evolving manganese complex. In a first step toward mimicking these reactions, we have made a Ru(II)\xe2\x88\x92polypyridine complex with an attached tyrosyl moiety. The photoexcited ruthenium complex played the role of P680 and was first oxidized by external acceptors. Combined transient absorbance and EPR studies provided evidence that the Ru(III) formed was reduced by intramolecular electron transfer from the attached tyrosine, with a rate constant of 5 \xc3\x97 104 s-1. Thus we show that a tyrosine radical could be formed by light-induced electron transfer reactions, and we indicate future directions for developing a closer analogy with the photosystem II reactions.

"Dicationic metal superoxo complexes, L(H2O)MOO2+ (M = Rh, Cr; L = (NH3)4, (H2O)5, [14]aneN4) react with rhodium hydrides L\xe2\x80\x98(H2O)RhH2+ (L\xe2\x80\x98 = (NH3)4, [14]aneN4, and meso-Me6-[14]aneN4) to yield L(H2O)MOOH2+ and L\xe2\x80\x98(H2O)2Rh2+. The rhodium(II) product is rapidly converted to L\xe2\x80\x98(H2O)RhOO2+ in a reaction with molecular oxygen (k \xe2\x88\xbc 108 M-1 s-1), or to a binuclear superoxo product in the absence of O2. When the central metal atom and nonparticipating ligands are identical in the two reactants (M = Rh, L = L\xe2\x80\x98), the O2 insertion into Rh\xe2\x88\x92H bond becomes catalytic, L\xe2\x80\x98RhH2+ + O2 \xe2\x86\x92 L\xe2\x80\x98RhOOH2+ (L\xe2\x80\x98RhOO2+ = catalyst). The hydrogen transfer step exhibits a large kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD = 7.6 for the reaction of CraqOO2+ with ([14]aneN4)(H2O)RhH2+, \xce\x94HH\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 20.3 \xc2\xb1 1.8 kJ mol-1, \xce\x94SH\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x92136 \xc2\xb1 6 J mol-1 K-1, and \xce\x94HD\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 24.7 \xc2\xb1 4.3 kJ mol-1, \xce\x94SD\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x92138 \xc2\xb1 15 J mol-1 K-1), but the isotopic composition of the solvent has no effect on rates, kH2O/kD2O = 1. Steric effects play a major role in the kinetics. From the available thermochemical data, the energy of the CraqOO\xe2\x88\x92H2+ bond was calculated to be \xe2\x88\xbc330 kJ/mol. "
"The crystal structures of three porphyrin diacid species, [H4OEP](ClO4)2, [H4TPP](ClO4)2, and [H4TMP](ClO4)2, have been determined from low-temperature X-ray diffraction data to delineate how the peripheral substituents of the porphyrin affect the overall molecular flexibility. [H4OEP](ClO4)2 (|Cb| = 0.46 \xc3\x85), [H4TMP](ClO4)2 (|Cb| = 0.67 \xc3\x85, molecule 1), and [H4TPP](ClO4)2 (|Cb| = 0.93 \xc3\x85) show increasingly saddled core conformations with effective D2d symmetry. The mean porphyrin\xe2\x88\x92aryl group dihedral angles in [H4TPP](ClO4)2 and [H4TMP](ClO4)2 (molecule 1) are 27(2)\xc2\xb0 and 63(13)\xc2\xb0, respectively. The steric bulk of the mesityl substituents in [H4TMP]2+ limits the range of observed porphyrin\xe2\x88\x92aryl group dihedral angles to >50\xc2\xb0 and, consequently, the magnitude of the core distortion. [H4TMP]2+ is therefore less flexible than [H4TPP]2+. Molecular mechanics calculations, using a modified version of MM2(87) and a newly developed force field for porphyrin diacids, correctly predict that the flexibility of meso-tetraaryl porphyrin diacids decreases as the steric bulk of the peripheral substituents increases:\xe2\x80\x89 [H4TPyP]2+ \xe2\x89\x88 [H4TPP]2+ > [H4T-2,6-(OH)2 PP]2+ \xe2\x89\x88 [H4T-2,6-F2 PP]2+ > [H4T-2,6-Cl2 PP]2+ \xe2\x89\x88 [H4TMP]2+. Grid searches of conformational space for [H4porphine]2+, [H4OEP]2+, [H4TPP]2+, and [H4T-2,6-Cl2 PP]2+ located pairs of inversion-related minima with D2d -saddled and C2h-stepped core conformations. The in vacuo strain energy barrier to inversion of the lowest-energy D2d-saddled conformation increases from 0.45 kcal/mol in [H4porphine]2+ to 1.9 kcal/mol in [H4T-2,6-Cl2PP]2+. The calculations indicate that the relative stability and magnitude of distortion of the D2d isomer increases as the steric bulk of the peripheral substituents increases; [H4OEP]2+ is therefore calculated to be less distorted than [H4TPP]2+, in agreement with the X-ray structures of these species.

"The synthesis and characterization of a phosphinoalkylarene, redox-switchable hemilabile ligand (RHL), (\xce\xb75-C5H5)Fe(\xce\xb75-C5H4C6H4OCH2CH2PPh2) (1), are reported. This ligand, which incorporates a redox-active ferrocenyl group, exhibits oxidation-state-dependent bonding properties and, hence, affords electrochemical control over the electronic and steric environments of bound transition metal centers. Two equivalents of 1 complex to Rh(I) to yield a bis(phosphine), \xce\xb76-arene complex [(\xce\xb71:\xce\xb76-(\xce\xb75-C5H5)Fe(\xce\xb75-C5H4C6H4OCH2CH2PPh2))(\xce\xb71-(\xce\xb75-C5H5)Fe(\xce\xb75-C5H4C6H4OCH2CH2PPh2))Rh]+BF4- (2). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies of 2\xc2\xb71.25CH2Cl2, as well as solution spectroscopic data of 2, are consistent with this formulated piano-stool geometry. Foremost, the properties of 2 as a function of bound RHL state-of-charge are extensively investigated. Interestingly, 2D 1H NMR exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) studies demonstrate significantly faster intramolecular \xce\xb76-arene, free arene exchange rates only upon oxidation of the ligand chelated to the Rh(I) center, as found in 22+. This faster exchange rate was used as a qualitative measure of the increased lability of the \xce\xb76-aryl group upon RHL oxidation. Moreover, activation parameters measured for the arene\xe2\x88\x92arene exchange reaction of 22+ also support a decrease in the Rh(I)\xe2\x88\x92arene interaction only upon oxidation of the ferrocenyl group on the bound \xce\xb76-arene moiety. In addition, changes in the stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity of 2 upon RHL oxidation are consistent with the observed charge-dependent arene\xe2\x88\x92arene exchange behavior. Significantly, labilization of a weakly bound \xce\xb76-arene moiety in 22+ results in substantial increases in both the acetonitrile bonding affinity and allyl ethyl ether isomerization activity of the Rh(I)\xe2\x88\x92RHL complex. In contrast, no significant changes in the reactivity of 2 were observed upon oxidation of the ligand which contained the ferrocenylarene not bound to the Rh(I) center, as found in 2+. This dependence of complex reactivity on RHL oxidation state demonstrates the utility of such novel metal complexes for the reversible, electrochemical control of transition metal center small molecule uptake or catalytic activity via the selective labilization of weakly coordinating groups upon ligand oxidation.

"A spin-echo mapping technique has been used to obtain the 31P NMR spectra of various cobalt-substituted aluminophosphate molecular sieves. The technique involves recording Hahn-echo spectra at different carrier frequencies in order to observe the signal within a broad spectral region. In contrast to the more commonly used magic angle spinning (MAS) or simple Hahn-echo methods, all phosphorus nuclei could be detected, even in the case of samples with high Co contents. Resonances are usually broad and range between about \xe2\x88\x92500 and 10 000 ppm/H3PO4, but the resolution is sufficient to access the local structure around the 31P nuclei. The technique is particularly interesting since the presence of signals above 500 ppm is direct proof for the framework cobalt siting. Indeed, such signals were not observed for Co-impregnated samples and are thus characteristic of framework Co species. The different NMR lines of the spectra have been assigned to various P(nCo) environments in the structure, and their shift was found to be approximately proportional to the number of Co atoms in the first coordination sphere around P atoms. A good agreement was found between the composition of the framework of the molecular sieve deduced from NMR spectra and that obtained by chemical analysis. Moreover, it was possible to estimate the location of Co atoms in the structure and to propose or confirm an ordering in the unit cell for two of the studied samples. "
"The thermodynamics and kinetics of adsorption of the redox-active dendrimers diaminobutane-dend-(NHCOFc)8, (dendrimer-Fc8), diaminobutane-dend-(NHCOFc)16, (dendrimer-Fc16), diaminobutane-dend-(NHCOFc)32, (dendrimer-Fc32), and diaminobutane-dend-(NHCOFc)64, (dendrimer-Fc64) containing 8, 16, 32, and 64 ferrocenyl moieties on the periphery, respectively, have been studied using electrochemical and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) techniques. All of these materials adsorb onto a Pt electrode surface. At an applied potential of 0.0 V (vs SSCE), where the ferrocenyl sites are in the reduced form and the dendrimers are neutral, the adsorption thermodynamics are well-characterized by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The kinetics of adsorption were activation-controlled and the rate constant decreased with decreasing size of the dendrimer. Potential scanning past +0.60 V, where the ferrocenyl sites are oxidized, gave rise to the electrodeposition of multilayer equivalents of the dendrimers. The additional material gradually desorbed upon rereduction, so only a monolayer equivalent remained on the electrode surface. Impedance analysis of the resonator response suggests that at multilayer equivalent coverages, the adsorbed dendrimers do not behave as rigid films and that incorporation of significant amounts of solvent and/or salt accompany the adsorption of these materials at such high coverages. On the other hand, at monolayer coverages, the adsorbed films appear to exhibit rigid film behavior. Using tapping mode atomic force microscopy we have been able to image dendrimer-Fc64 adsorbed onto a Pt(111) surface. The images reveal that the apparent size of the dendrimer adsorbed on the surface is significantly larger than estimated values based on calculations, which is ascribed to a flattening of the dendrimer upon adsorption.

"Thienylenevinylene oligomers (nTVs) containing up to 10 thiophene rings and bearing solubilizing hexyl groups at the \xce\xb1-position of the end thiophene rings or octyl or dibutyl chains at the 3-position or the 3- and 4-positions of the thiophene rings have been synthesized by a combination of formylation reaction, Wittig\xe2\x88\x92Horner olefination, and McMurry dimerization. Owing to the good solubility imparted by alkyl chains, the electrochemical behavior of nTVs has been analyzed for the first time. Chain extension leads to a negative shift of the peak potentials corresponding to the formation of the cation radical and dication and to a decrease of their difference. For the octamers the dication is formed directly through a two-electron transfer while the system can be reversibly charged up to the tetracationic state. Electronic absorption spectra show the expected bathochromic shift of \xce\xbbmax and decrease of the HOMO\xe2\x88\x92LUMO gap with extension of the conjugation length. Thus, solution-cast films of octamers exhibit band-gap values comparable to or even smaller than that of the parent poly(thienylenevinylene) (PTV). Extrapolation of the electrochemical and optical data to infinite chain length suggests that the oxidation potential and intrinsic band gap of a defect-free PTV could be significantly smaller than the present experimental values.

"The electron transfer (ET) rate at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions was probed as a function of the driving force and distance between redox centers by scanning electrochemical microscopy. The adsorption of phospholipids at the interface resulted in a decrease in the rate of interfacial ET between aqueous redox species and the oxidized form of zinc porphyrin in benzene. The fraction of the interfacial area covered with lipid (\xce\xb8) was evaluated from the measured heterogeneous rate constants (kf). The dependence of \xce\xb8 vs lipid concentration in benzene fit a Langmuir isotherm. For complete monolayers of phospholipids, kf was a function of the number of methylene groups in a hydrocarbon chain. The driving force dependencies of interfacial ET rates (Tafel plots) were measured for several aqueous redox couples. They were linear, with a transfer coefficient of \xce\xb1 \xe2\x89\x85 0.5 when the driving force for ET (\xce\x94G\xc2\xb0) was not too high, in agreement with Marcus theory, and leveled off to the diffusion-controlled rate at larger overpotentials. For even higher \xce\x94G\xc2\xb0 and for the first time for heterogeneous ET at a polarizable interface, inverted region behavior was observed. "
"A combination of electrospray ionization MS/MS techniques, isotopic labeling experiments in the gas-phase and solution, and ab initio calculations is used to study the C\xe2\x88\x92H activation reactions of [Cp*Ir(PMe3)(CH3)]+ and [CpIr(PMe3)(CH3)]+. The reaction in the gas phase was found to proceed through a Cp or [Cp*Ir(\xce\xb72-CH2PMe2)]+ intermediate. Quantitative collision-induced dissociation (CID) threshold measurements were used along with general models for ion\xe2\x88\x92molecule reactions to construct potential energy diagrams which rationalize the gas-phase results. The comparison between the two complexes, and between the reactions in the gas phase and in solution, suggests that the reaction through the intermediacy of a metallaphosphacyclopropane could be favored over the conventional (and simpler) oxidative addition/reductive elimination mechanism when the Ir(III) complex is rendered more electron deficient.

"Bonneau et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 3829\xe2\x88\x923827) have proposed that carbene\xe2\x88\x92olefin \xcf\x80-complexes can mediate the stereoselectivity of 1,2-dichloroethylidene (1) rearrangements. Computational studies at MP2 and CBS-Q theoretical levels confirm the experimentally observed preference for rearrangement of 1 to give (Z)-1,2-dichloroethylene. Studies of this and related rearrangements have led to a model to explain the origin of this stereoselectivity. Density functional calculations using Becke3LYP/6-31G* theory suggest that carbene\xe2\x88\x92olefin complexes do not exist as intermediates in the cycloadditions of 1 to ethylene or to tetramethylethylene. The experimental results can be explained by an alternative model in which 18.7% of the diazirine precursor produces alkene product without intervention of the carbene. Becke3LYP/6-31G* calculations on the 1,2-shift of hydrogen concerted with loss of nitrogen and on rearrangement of the diazirine to a diazo intermediate show that these processes are not likely to be the alternative pathways.

"Pulse radiolysis studies have demonstrated that the kinetics of myoglobin reduction changes with the pH of the solution. The reduction rate constant of the protein decreases with increasing pH. The net charge of the macromolecule was longtime considered to be responsible for this dependence. However, for every protein molecule bearing many reduction sites, the reduction rate of the protein would be the summation of the individual reactions of hydrated electrons on each particular reducible site. The two schemes of protein reduction were checked by the investigation of the behavior of the experimental reduction constant values (i) versus the protein charge (Br\xc3\xb6nsted approach) and (ii) versus the reducible imidazolium groups number of the protein. Although the two plots are linear and seem to assert that the two approaches are equivalent, a critical analysis shows that the Br\xc3\xb6nsted formulation cannot be applied to proteins. This scheme gives also erroneous different radii for the same protein. Thus, this work rationalizes the pH-dependent rate of reduction by an interaction of the hydrated electron with protonated histidine residues of the protein. "
"The photoinduced ring-opening process in spiropyran compounds has been modeled through CASSCF calculations on the lowest excited state (S1) of benzopyran. The documented S1 reaction coordinate is characterized by a ring-opening transition state connecting a cyclic intermediate to a much more stable acyclic structure. Remarkably this structure does not correspond to a real S1 intermediate but to a crossing point (i.e., a conical intersection) between the excited- and ground-state energy surfaces. At this crossing the excited-state system can undergo fully efficient decay to S0. Using the parent pyran molecule as a model, we have characterized two ground-state valleys which develop from the crossing point. The first valley leads to reactant (pyran) regeneration. The second valley leads to cZc-penta-2,4-dienal indicating that the primary ring-opened photoproduct is formed in an unstable conformation. The benzopyran/pyran reaction coordinates suggest that the first step in the benzospiropyran photochromic reaction must correspond to the excited-state ring opening of the benzopyran moiety. It is shown that while this process can be controlled by a small energy barrier, it ultimately leads to ultrafast radiationless decay at a structure where the C\xe2\x88\x92O bond distance is ca. 2.3 \xc3\x85. Upon ground-state relaxation this structure can generate either a cZc precursor of merocyanine (via full ring opening) or the starting benzospiropyran (via ring closure). This mechanistic picture seems to be consistent with the present experimental knowledge. "
"Accurate distance measurements between pairs of nuclear spins can provide detailed information about molecular structure in the solid state. The rotational resonance (R2) technique, in particular, has been used to measure internuclear distances in a variety of compounds, often between pairs of 13C nuclei where the outer range is 5\xe2\x88\x926 \xc3\x85. Recent studies have revealed that the spin dynamics at rotational resonance are influenced by zero-quantum line shape parameters including T2zq and the dispersion in isotropic chemical shift differences. Errors in the estimation of these parameters are often the limiting factor in determining the accuracy of a distance measurement. Here we present a modification of R2, termed \xe2\x80\x9crotational resonance tickling\xe2\x80\x9d (R2T), which uses a ramped rf field to induce fast passage through the dipolar resonance condition, thereby greatly reducing the dependence of the spin dynamics on zero-quantum parameters. Extraction of distance information from the resulting exchange curves is approximately a single-parameter fit, with accuracies in model systems that appear to be on the order of \xc2\xb10.1 \xc3\x85 or better. An additional feature of the technique is that it does not demand the very high-power 1H decoupling fields typically required in other recoupling experiments to limit signal loss during mixing. We demonstrate the technique in a pair of 13C2-labeled model compounds, tyrosine ethyl ester and glycylglycine hydrochloride, with effective internuclear distances (including intermolecular effects) of 5.05 and 4.3 \xc3\x85, respectively.

"The structure, conformational behavior, and magnetic coupling constant of a prototypical organic molecular magnet (the bis(imino)nitroxide) have been investigated in vacuo and in solution, combining a recent density functional theory/Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock model with a refined continuum description of the solvent. Comparison with previous sophisticated computations for a simplified model shows that our approach provides reliable magnetic couplings for a wide range (0\xe2\x88\x922000 cm-1) of interactions between the radical subunits. The computations performed for the true compound at the experimental conformation show that structural and magnetic parameters are in remarkable agreement with experiment. Solvent effects are negligible concerning the magnetic coupling but modify the conformational behavior leading to an inter-ring torsional angle in better agreement with the experimental value. "
"Five isomers of the carbon-rich molecule C5H2 are investigated computationally, using methods based on the coupled-cluster approximation. All of these structures are related to isomers of C3H2 via substitution of hydrogen by ethynyl or attachment of a C2 fragment to a carbene center. The two most stable forms of C5H2 are linear triplet pentadiynylidene (4) and singlet ethynylcyclopropenylidene (6). Both of these isomers have been observed in the laboratory, as has a thirdthe cumulene carbene pentatetraenylidene (5)which is predicted to lie about 15 kcal/mol above the linear triplet. Two other isomers are also studied:\xe2\x80\x89 ethynylpropadienylidene (7) and 3-(didehydrovinylidene)cyclopropene (8). Both are found to lie less than 25 kcal/mol above the most stable form of C5H2 and to possess rather large dipole moments. Predictions for the harmonic vibrational frequencies of 12C and mono-13C isotopomers, infrared intensities, and rotational constants are also presented. These should assist efforts to identify these molecules in the laboratory and in the interstellar medium. "
"Computational studies of carbenium ions relevant to sterol biosynthesis via lanosterol synthase were undertaken to determine fundamental energetics underlying cyclization steps. Ab initio B3LYP/6-31G*//B3LYP/6-31G* calculations were performed for the addition of 2-methyl-2-propyl cation and 2-methylpropene to represent a tertiary cation \xe2\x86\x92 tertiary cation cyclization. Solvent effects were included by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in methylene chloride, methanol, and THF. The picture that emerges for a cation\xe2\x88\x92olefin cyclization is one of barrierless collapse at short distance, while desolvation and conformational barriers are expected for initial separations beyond ca. 5 \xc3\x85. Thus, the cyclization that forms the sterol B ring likely proceeds in barrierless concert with A-ring formation in the preorganized environment of a cyclase enzyme. However, C-ring formation appears to involve a tertiary \xe2\x86\x92 secondary cation rearrangement. This was modeled by ab initio and MC calculations for the interconversion of the C11 cations, 9 and 10. The 12 kcal/mol higher energy for the secondary ion is only reduced to ca. 10 kcal/mol by solvation. Though this is consistent with initial formation of the tertiary ion, force-field calculations on the full protosteryl cations show that the equilibrium between the isomeric ions can be readily shifted by selective placement of nucleophilic groups from the protein backbone or side chains including the indole ring of tryptophans.

"Ser was replaced at position 286 of firefly luciferase (Luciola mingrelica) by a series of naturally occurring and unnatural amino acids. The effect of these substitutions on the properties of luciferase, such as thermostability, pH dependence, and color of light emitted, was investigated. For these purposes, the Ser286 codon (AGT) was replaced by an amber stop codon (TAG) within the luciferase gene and transformed into Escherichia coli strains producing specific amber suppressor tRNA\'s to express luciferase with different substitutions at this position. The incorporation of Leu, Lys, Tyr, or Gln at this position reduced the thermostability of mutated luciferases. The color of emitted light changed upon substitution from yellow-green (\xce\xbbmax 582 nm) for the wild-type enzyme having Ser286 to, for example, red (\xce\xbbmax 622 nm) for luciferase having Leu286. For further evaluation of the structural relationship between the amino acid position at 286 and the wavelength of emitted light, we used the method of in vitro incorporation of unnatural amino acids, which involves readthrough of a nonsense (UAG) codon by a misacylated suppressor tRNA. The amino acids incorporated at position 286 in this fashion included O-glucosylated serine, serine phosphonate, tyrosine phosphate, and tyrosine methylenephosphonate. The wavelength of light emitted by the luciferase analogues was measured. While the introduction of serine phosphonate and glucosylated serine did not change the \xce\xbbmax of light produced by luciferase, the incorporation of tyrosine phosphate and tyrosine methylenephosphonate into position 286 altered the spectra of emitted light compared with those of Ser286 and Tyr286. The pH dependence of the wavelength of light emitted by the luciferases containing the negatively charged phosphorylated Tyr analogues was demonstrated and could be rationalized in terms of the pKa\'s of the phosph(on)ate oxygens.

"N\xcf\x89-Allyl-l-arginine is shown to be a competitive reversible inhibitor and time-dependent inactivator of bovine brain nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). The enzyme is protected against inactivation by the presence of the substrate, the absence of O2, or if NADP+ is substituted for NADPH. The NADPH absorption spectrum is converted to that of NADP+ concomitant with inactivation. The latter two results indicate that redox chemistry is required for inactivation. N\xcf\x89-Allyl-N\xcf\x89-hydroxy-l-arginine is synthesized and shown also to be a competitive inhibitor and time-dependent inactivator of nNOS, suggesting that it is a viable intermediate in the inactivation process. Inactivation of nNOS with N\xcf\x89-allyl-[14C]-l-arginine or N\xcf\x89-[3H]allyl-l-arginine followed by gel filtration or dialysis results in no radioactivity bound to the enzyme. It is shown spectrophotometrically as well as by HPLC that the heme is modified to four different species during inactivation. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometry is used to show that 1 equiv of ferric ion is present in the modified hemes. When the heme is isolated after inactivation by the two radiolabeled inactivators, it is found that no 14C is associated, but 0.9 equiv of 3H is bound to the heme. This indicates that only the allyl part of the inactivator is bound to the heme. HPLC\xe2\x88\x92electrospray mass spectrometry is used to show that the four modified hemes have the same mass which corresponds to heme plus an allyl group plus a hydrogen. The fact that the modified hemes no longer have an absorption at 400 nm but, instead, absorb at 280 nm suggests that four reduced and allylated hemes are produced (such as 34 or 35). N\xcf\x89-Propyl-l-arginine also is shown to be a competitive inhibitor and time-dependent inactivator of nNOS; inactivation requires O2 and NADPH, and the substrate protects the enzyme from inactivation. Twenty-six equivalents of citrulline and nitric oxide is produced during inactivation with N\xcf\x89-propyl-l-arginine. This suggests that the double bond of the allyl group is not important to the inactivation mechanism. Possible mechanisms that rationalize these results are suggested. No N\xcf\x89-allyl-l-citrulline (39) is detected from the inactivation of nNOS by N\xcf\x89-allyl-l-arginine, which indicates that initial hydroxylation of the guanidino imine nitrogen does not occur. The only radioactive metabolite generated from N\xcf\x89-allyl-[14C]-l-arginine inactivation is citrulline (13 equiv). Approximately 13 equiv of nitric oxide also are generated. When N\xcf\x89-allyl-N\xcf\x89-hydroxy-l-arginine is the inactivator, about 20 equiv of citrulline and nitric oxide is produced. When N\xcf\x89-[3H]allyl-l-arginine is the inactivator, approximately equal amounts of 3H2O and acrolein are produced (8\xe2\x88\x929 equiv); arginine also is a product. Acrolein does not inactivate nNOS. These last few findings support cleavage of the \xce\xb1-C\xe2\x88\x92H bond of the allyl group as a turnover pathway which does not lead to inactivation. "
"This paper reports synthetic and structural studies of a 16-membered combinatorial library of chemical models for parallel \xce\xb2-sheets (1) and two four-membered libraries of controls (2 and 3). The libraries contain glycine, alanine, valine, and leucine residues, and the structural studies use 1H NMR and IR spectroscopy to measure the relative degrees of intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the parallel \xce\xb2-sheet models in chloroform solution. These studies indicate that leucine and valine are relatively good at forming parallel \xce\xb2-sheets, alanine is moderate, and glycine is poor (L, V > A > G). "
"A question of how uracil nitrogen N(1) is selectively activated in enzymes (e.g., for deglycosylation in uracil-DNA glycosylase) has been utterly overlooked, to which we have addressed by a model study with 6-((1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecyl)methyl)uracil (HL, cyclen-attached uracil). The uracil N(1)H of the diprotonated cyclen-attached uracil (HL\xc2\xb72H+) is easily deprotonated to be N(1)- anion form (L-\xc2\xb72H+) in aqueous solution. The deprotonation constant (pKa) of 7.14 for HL\xc2\xb72H+ \xe2\x87\x84 L-\xc2\xb72H+ + H+ was determined by potentiometric pH titration at 25 \xc2\xb0C with I = 0.10 (NaClO4). The unusually low deprotonation constant (cf. pKa = 9.9 for 3-methyluracil) is due to the electrostatic stabilization of the N(1)- anion by a proximate secondary ammonium cation of the diprotonated cyclen at physiological pH. The X-ray crystal structure of HL\xc2\xb72H+ as its dipicrate revealed that the uracil N(1)H is linked by a hydrogen bond network to one of the cyclen secondary ammonium cation through a water. Crystals of HL\xc2\xb72H+\xc2\xb7(picrate)2\xc2\xb7H2O (C25H32N12O17) are triclinic, space group P1\xcc\x84 (no. 2) with a = 9.295(4) \xc3\x85, b = 19.67(1) \xc3\x85, c = 8.886(6) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb1 = 94.36(3)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb2 = 102.95(4)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb3 = 87.04(4)\xc2\xb0, V = 1576(8) \xc3\x853, Z = 2, R = 0.054, and Rw = 0.081. The electrostatic stabilization of uracil N(1)- anion is reassessed by a comparative study with a zinc(II) complex with the cyclen-attached uracil, where Zn2+ in the cyclen cavity strongly binds to the uracil N(1)- (localized) anion. The deprotonation of N(1)H of HL (1 mM) occurred below pH 5 by the effect of equimolar Zn2+, a stronger acid than two protons. Crystals of the zinc(II) complex (C13H23N6O2Zn\xc2\xb7ClO4\xc2\xb7H2O) are triclinic, space group P1\xcc\x84 (no. 2) with a = 9.461(3) \xc3\x85, b = 13.156(4) \xc3\x85, c = 8.687(2) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb1 = 101.21(2)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb2 = 103.55(2)\xc2\xb0, \xce\xb3 = 73.21(2)\xc2\xb0, V = 997(0) \xc3\x853, Z = 2, R = 0.063, and Rw = 0.093. For comparison, we also have investigated the uracil N(1) acidity with an ethylenediamine-attached uracil and an isomeric cyclen-attached (at C(5)) uracil. The present example of electrostatic stabilization of N(1)- anion may explain the facile uracil N(1)-alkyl (e.g., glycosyl) bond formation and cleavage in enzymes. "
"The binding of cationic lipids to DNA induces the condensation of complexes of the lipid and polyelectrolyte. This paper presents data on the binding of the simple cationic lipid cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to DNA prior to the condensation process. The complete thermodynamics of the binding of CTAB to both helical and single strand DNA are evaluated with use of isothermal titration calorimetery data and analysis of UV melting transitions. The binding to the helical form involves a two-step process:\xe2\x80\x89 first, binding to an isolated phosphate site on the DNA strand with a binding constant of 1.5 \xc3\x97 103 M-1, and second, a highly cooperative binding event that seems to involve hydrophobic intereactions between hydrocarbon chains of the bound CTAB. The cooperativity parameter is 56, leading to a cooperative binding constant of 8.7 \xc3\x97 104 M-1. The enthalpies of the two binding events on the helix sites are resolved:\xe2\x80\x89 \xe2\x88\x9220 kJ/mol for the isolated site and +3.3 kJ/mol for contiguous sites. Binding to the single strand DNA is also quite strong with an estimated equilibrium constant of about 1.3 \xc3\x97 104 M-1. Because CTAB binds both to helical and single strand DNA, biphasic melting transitions are observed. An analysis of the behavior of the melting curves and the thermodynamic data allows reasonable models of the binding processes to be constructed. "
"The biosynthesis of the tropane alkaloids in transformed root cultures of Datura stramonium has been studied using sodium [1,2-13C2]acetate, (R,S)-[2,3-13C2]-1-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)propan-2-one {(R,S)-[2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-13C2]hygrine}, ethyl (R,S)-[1,2-13C2,2-14C]-2-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)acetate, and ethyl (R,S)-[2,3-13C2,3-14C]-4-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-3-oxobutanoate. The incorporation of (R,S)-[2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-13C2]hygrine into cuscohygrine and several other condensation products was high (15\xe2\x88\x9240% specific incorporation), but label was not recovered in either tropine or tropine esters (hyoscyamine; 0.0 \xc2\xb1 0.5% specific incorporation). None of the recovered alkaloids was labeled when ethyl (R,S)-[1,2-13C2,2-14C]-2-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)acetate was fed to the cultures. In contrast, sodium [1,2-13C2]acetate and ethyl (R,S)-[2,3-13C2,3-14C]-4-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-3-oxobutanoate were incorporated into hyoscyamine (9 and 2% specific incorporation, respectively) and a number of other tropane alkaloids (up to 12% specific incorporation). These data provide further evidence that hygrine is not a direct precursor of tropane alkaloids. 13C-Label from acetate was incorporated symmetrically into the C-2 and C-4 positions of (\xe2\x88\x92)-hyoscyamine. The evidence supports a pathway in which acetoacetate reacts via its C-4 position with N-methyl-\xce\x941-pyrrolinium salt to give 4-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-3-oxobutanoate. This intermediate favors cyclization to give 2-carboxytropinone, tropinone being formed by decarboxylation. "
"The first total syntheses of the cytotoxic macrolides (+)-acutiphycin (1) and (+)-trans-20,21-didehydroacutiphycin (2) have been achieved. An acyclic stereocontrol strategy was employed to establish the configurations at C(5), C(10), and C(13) as well as the E geometry of the C(8,9)-trisubstituted olefin. Importantly, the natural source of 1 and 2, the blue-green alga Osillatoria acutissima, no longer produces these metabolites. "
"Conjugative interactions of the carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon double bond are fundamental in organic chemistry. In this work, equilibria are established among conjugated and unconjugated isomers of two \xce\xb2-substituted styrenes, 1-phenylbut-1-ene and 1-phenyl-3-methylbut-1-ene, and one \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-disubstituted styrene, 2-phenyl-5-methylhex-2-ene, over a range of temperatures (the van\'t Hoff method) in hexamethylphosphoric triamide and potassium tert-butoxide. From the trans styrenes of the first two sets, an enthalpy of conjugative interaction of phenyl vis-\xc3\xa0-vis alkyl (\xce\x94\xce\x94HConjInter/Alk) = \xe2\x88\x922.5 \xc2\xb1 0.2 kcal/mol [\xe2\x88\x925.1 kcal/mol defined as phenyl vis-\xc3\xa0-vis hydrogen (\xce\x94\xce\x94HConjInter/H)] is observed, while the cis styrenes reveal an attenuated \xce\x94\xce\x94HConjInter/Alk of \xe2\x88\x921.1 kcal/mol (\xce\x94\xce\x94HConjInter/H = \xe2\x88\x922.7 kcal/mol). The \xce\xb1-methyl group in the third set also leads to a reduced conjugative interaction. Entropy plays an important role in determining positions of equilibrium. Free energies of conjugation are reported for several sterically hindered o-methyl-substituted styrenes. "
"The self-assembly of the tris-bipyridine ligands BI and BII with iron(II) salts yields polynuclear complexes displaying structures of cyclic double-helix type, termed circular helicates [n]cH (of order n). With BI in which the bipyridine units in the ligand are connected by ethylene bridges, penta- or hexanuclear architectures [5]cH and [6]cH are obtained, depending on the anion present during the self-assembly process. The elongated tris-bipyridine ligand BII with oxypropylene bridges forms a tetranuclear circular helicate [4]cH, whose structure has been confirmed by crystal structure determination. The possible oligomeric combinations of tris-bipy ligands and iron(II) ions may be considered to constitute the potential members of a virtual combinatorial library, generated via dynamic combinatorial chemistry, from which a specific real constituent of the virtual set of circular helicates is expressed in given conditions.

"Thermal cyclization of 7,10-diethynylfluoranthene (3) in the gas phase gives corannulene (2), the smallest bowl-shaped polycyclic hydrocarbon fragment of C60 with fullerene-like curvature. Bromocorannulene (10) and 1,6-dibromocorannulene (9) have also been obtained from flash pyrolysis of 7,10-bis(2,2-dibromovinyl)fluoranthene (8). Short, practical syntheses of several corannulene precursors from acenaphthenequinone are described which have made corannulene available in gram quantities. "
"The water catalyzed hydrolyses of p-nitrotrifluoroacetanilide (3) and trifluoroacetanilide (8) were studied at various pH\'s and temperatures. The activation parameters for the water reactions of 3 and 8 are:\xe2\x80\x89 \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 14.4 \xc2\xb1 0.6 and 11.7 \xc2\xb1 0.3 kcal/mol and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9236.1 \xc2\xb1 1.8 and \xe2\x88\x9252.3 \xc2\xb1 0.7 cal/mol\xc2\xb7K, respectively. These are consistent with reactions that involve considerable restriction of degrees of freedom of the solvent/substrate in the transition state. A proton inventory analysis of the rate constants for hydrolysis of 3 in media of different mole fraction D2O indicates the process involves two or more protons in flight or undergoing loosening of their bonding in the transition state. 18O-Labeled amides were subjected to the hydrolytic conditions for various times up to 3 half-times of hydrolysis and recovered. Mass analysis showed that the 18O content in the recovered amide did not change during the course of the reaction. All the data support a process where the rate-limiting step for the water reaction involves a concerted or nearly concerted formation of a diol which undergoes subsequent C\xe2\x88\x92N cleavage in preference to OH expulsion.

"The first chalcogen-bridged [1]ferrocenophanes Fe(\xce\xb7-C5H3R)2E (6, E = S, R = H; 7, E = Se, R = H; 12, E = S, R = Me) have been synthesized and characterized both structurally and spectroscopically. Synthesis of sulfur- and selenium-bridged species 6 and 7 was achieved by the reaction of dilithioferrocene\xc2\xb7TMEDA (TMEDA = tetramethylethylenediamine) with bis(phenylsulfonyl) sulfide S(O2SPh)2 and selenium diethyldithiocarbamate Se(S2CNEt2)2, respectively, in 20\xe2\x88\x9230% yields. Structural characterization of both 6 and 7 revealed highly strained structures with tilt-angles between the cyclopentadienyl ligands of 31.05(10)\xc2\xb0 and 26.4(2)\xc2\xb0, respectively. Compounds 6 and 7 are purple and red-purple, respectively; comparison of the structures of known [1]ferrocenophanes 1 showed that when the second period (from group 14\xe2\x88\x9216) is traversed, there is a substantial increase in cyclopentadienyl ring-tilting in main group element bridged [1]ferrocenophanes, and the lowest energy UV/vis absorption peaks become increasingly red-shifted. Extended H\xc3\xbcckel MO calculations were performed and, consistent with this observation, predicted a decrease in the HOMO\xe2\x88\x92LUMO gap as the ring-tilt increases. Thermal ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of both 6 and 7 afforded the insoluble poly(ferrocenyl sulfide) [Fe(\xce\xb7-C5H4)2S]n 8 and poly(ferrocenyl selenide) [Fe(\xce\xb7-C5H4)2Se]n 9, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry studies of the ROP process provided estimates of the strain energies of 6 and 7 which were ca. 130(\xc2\xb120) and 110(\xc2\xb120) kJ mol-1, respectively. Anionic ROP of 6 also yielded the insoluble poly(ferrocenyl sulfide) 8. However, linear soluble dimeric and trimeric trimethylsilyl-capped oligo(ferrocenyl sulfides) 10b and 11b were synthesized by the reaction of 6 with dilithioferrocene\xc2\xb7TMEDA followed by the addition of Me3SiCl and were characterized spectroscopically, electrochemically, and, for 11b, by X-ray diffraction, and provide useful models for the analogous high polymer. The dimethylated sulfur-bridged species 12 was prepared as a mixture of isomers from the reaction between dilithiodimethylferrocene\xc2\xb7TMEDA and S(O2SPh)2, and X-ray structural characterization of a single isomer 12a showed the presence of a large tilt-angle of 31.46(8)\xc2\xb0. Thermal and anionic ROP of the isomer mixture 12 afforded the first soluble poly(ferrocenyl sulfide) [Fe(\xce\xb7-C5H3Me)2S]n 13 which was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and gel permeation chromatography. Cyclic voltammetric studies of 13 showed the presence of two reversible oxidation waves with a redox coupling \xce\x94E = ca. 0.32 V, which is consistent with the presence of significantly stronger M\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7M interactions compared to those present in other ring-opened poly(ferrocenes) derived from [1]ferrocenophanes.

"The reactions of 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl (tert-octyl) peroxypivalate (1) with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene in the presence of the free radical scavenger 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-2-yloxyl (2) have been studied at 60 \xc2\xb0C. tert-Butyl and tert-octyloxyl radicals (3) were generated from the thermolysis of 1. The predominant unimolecular reactions of 3, that is, \xce\xb2-scission to form neopentyl radicals (14b) and a 1,5-H shift to form 4-hydroxy-2,2,4-trimethylpentyl radicals (14c), were observed in both monomer systems. The resulting alkyl radicals underwent selective addition to the two monomers. The relative reactivities of the alkyl radicals toward addition to the monomers were obtained from competitive addition/trapping reactions. The absolute rate constants for the addition of alkyl radicals 14b and 14c to the two monomers at 60 \xc2\xb0C were estimated to be 9.5 \xc3\x97 105 and 2.6 \xc3\x97 105 M-1 s-1 to MMA and 4.5 \xc3\x97 105 and 0.7 \xc3\x97 105 M-1 s-1 to styrene, respectively. The low reactivities of 3 and 14c toward addition to MMA and styrene were attributed to steric effects. Steric effects were also responsible for the low rate of the 1,5-H shift in 3. "
"The synthesis of the photochemical probes 6 and 7 is described. These photoprobes are analogues of dolichol and dolichol phosphate, obligatory intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum. The synthesis of 6 and 7 follows a new strategy. It involves the sequential alkylation of a monoterpenoid hydroxysulfonyl dianion with allyl chlorides. The photoreactive group, a 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-aryldiazirine, was connected to the hydroxylated methyl group of the \xce\xb2-prenyl unit of the fully assembled polyprenyl chain. The photoactivatable dolichol analogue 6 is a substrate for dolichol kinase from yeast membranes, an essential enzyme involved in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. "
"Recent successful zeolite structure determination based on electron diffraction and image analysis data shows interesting prospects to characterize zeolitic frameworks provided the crystals are thin enough to produce useful crystallographic phases from image analysis. Zeolite SSZ-25 and porosil ITQ-1 structures were compared to reveal if they are isomorphous to MCM-22 zeolite. By using electron microdiffraction intensity data in the [0001] axis and phases extracted from HREM images taken at different defocus conditions, the resulting projected [0001] potential maps are found to be very similar for both structures and close to that of the MCM-22 zeolite.

"[Pt2(PPh3)4(\xce\xbc-S)2] (1) reacts with AgCl(PPh3) and CuCl under a mild pressure of CO (60 psi) to give [Pt2(CO)(PPh3)3(\xce\xbc3-S)MCl] [M = Ag (4) and Cu (6)] via the intermediates [Pt2(PPh3)4(\xce\xbc3-S)2Ag(PPh3)]Cl (2a), [Pt2(PPh3)5(\xce\xbc3-S)2AgCl] (3), and [Pt2(PPh3)5(\xce\xbc3-S)2CuCl] (5), respectively. These transformations demonstrate an unprecedented concomitant process which involve heterometalation, carbonylation, reductive desulfurization, and metal\xe2\x88\x92metal bond formation. The Ru\xe2\x88\x92Pt aggregate of [Pt2(PPh3)4(\xce\xbc3-S)2RuCl(PPh3)2]Cl (7), prepared from 1 and RuCl2(PPh3)3, similarly converts to a [Pt2(CO)2(PPh3)2(\xce\xbc3-S)RuCl(CO)(PPh3)]Cl (8) cluster under a CO atmosphere. Such transformation establishes a synthetic relationship between the {Pt2MS2} trigonal bipyramidal aggregates and {Pt2MS} tetrahedral clusters and provides a general entry to triangular heterometallic sulfide clusters of platinum. All complexes are characterized by IR, 31P{1H}, and 13C NMR spectroscopy and conductivity measurements. The structures of 4, 6, and the PF6- derivative of 2a (viz. 2b) have also been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. The structure of 2b shows a sulfide-bicapped Ag\xe2\x88\x92Pt mixed-metal triangle without significant Pt\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Pt [3.351(2) and 3.375(2) \xc3\x85] or Ag\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Pt [av 3.064(1) and 3.101(1) \xc3\x85] interactions. Complex 2b crystallizes in two polymorphic modifications with different degrees of disposition of the Ag moieties with respect to the {Pt2S2} core. As a result, the Ag\xe2\x88\x92S bonds [2.479(1) vs 2.585(1) \xc3\x85 and 2.502(2) vs 2.607(2) \xc3\x85] are significantly different between the polymorphs in which the Ag\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Pt distances are near-equivalent [3.061(1) vs 3.066(1) \xc3\x85] in one form but significantly different [2.962(1) vs 3.240(1) \xc3\x85] in the other. Complex 4 shows a triangular {AgPt2} cluster mono-capped by sulfide. Removal of a capping sulfur atom from 2a effectively reduces both PtII centers and favors Pt\xe2\x88\x92Pt bond formation [Pt\xe2\x88\x92Pt 2.658(2) \xc3\x85] and heterometallic Ag\xe2\x88\x92Pt interactions [av Ag\xe2\x88\x92Pt 2.965(1) \xc3\x85] in 4. Both the Pt\xe2\x88\x92S and Ag\xe2\x88\x92S bonds also strengthen significantly from 2b to 4. Cluster 6 is isostructural to 4 with similar homo- [Pt\xe2\x88\x92Pt 2.657(1) \xc3\x85] and heterometal [av Cu\xe2\x88\x92Pt 2.832(1) \xc3\x85 interactions. Both 4 and 6 thus constitute a {MPt2S} distorted tetrahedral cluster frame. A facile and general aggregates-to-clusters conversion through the elimination of COS gas is thus established. "
"The photophysical behavior of [(bpy)2Ru(L)]2+ complexes (L = 4-(1\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-pyrenyl)-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine, bpy-pyr; 2-(1\xe2\x80\x98-pyrenyl)-1,10-phenanthroline, phen-pyr; and 2-(2\xe2\x80\x98-naphthyl)-1,10-phenanthroline, phen-nap) was investigated in solutions and frozen matrices. The conformation of the linked pyrene differs in the two complexes:\xe2\x80\x89 The pyrene moiety is conformationally constrained to be nearly perpendicular to the phenanthroline in the phen-pyr complex while the pyrene in the bpy-pyr complex has much greater flexibility about the C\xe2\x88\x92C bond linking the ligand and the pyrene. The 3MLCT excited state of the Ru(II) diimine complex and the 3(\xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80*) state of the pyrenyl substituent are nearly isoenergetic; the 3MLCT state is the lowest energy state in the bpy-pyr complex, and the pyrene 3(\xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80*) state is lower in energy for the phen-pyr complex. The bpy-pyr complex is unique in that the 3MLCT state has a very long lived luminescence (approximately 50 \xce\xbcs in degassed CH3CN). Luminescence decays for both pyrene containing complexes can be fit as double exponentials, indicating that the 3MLCT and 3(\xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80*) states are not in equilibrium. Analysis of decays obtained at several temperatures reveal that energy transfer is slower than relaxation of the 3MLCT state but more rapid than decay of the pyrene localized 3(\xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80*) state. The results also suggest that electronic coupling between the two states is weak despite the fact that the two chromophores are separated by a single covalent bond. "
"An extensive assignment of the 1H NMR spectra of a CuA domain from the cytochrome c oxidase of Paracoccus denitrificans has been obtained on the basis of dipolar connectivities coupled to the available structural information. The assignment has been extended with the aid of 2H NMR spectra on a protein sample with cysteines selectively labeled at the \xce\xb2 position. The spectra have been compared to those published earlier for a similar CuA fragment from the Thermus thermophilus oxidase and for a CuA construct in a blue copper protein, amicyanin. The shifts and their temperature dependence are discussed in terms of molecular orbital descriptions available for these systems. The mechanisms for the fast electron relaxation, which make the obtainment of relatively sharp NMR signals possible, are discussed. It is shown that the proton shifts of one histidine are variable from one system to the other, possibly reflecting changes in its interaction with the Cu2S2 diamond structure. Large electron delocalization onto the S atoms is confirmed. This is reflected in the large shifts experienced by the cysteine \xce\xb2-CH2 protons, and these shifts are in turn tuned by the Cu\xe2\x88\x92S\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92H torsion angles. It is suggested that the electronic structure of CuA is ideal for its function in electron transfer. "
"Protonation of TpM(PR3)H2 (M = Rh, Ir) complexes with HBF4\xc2\xb7Et2O or [H(Et2O)2][B(Ar)4] (Ar = 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3) affords cationic complexes which exhibit a single hydride resonance at all accessible temperatures in the 1H NMR spectrum. Formulation as fluxional dihydrogen/hydride complexes is indicated by short T1(min) values of ca. 22 ms (Ir) and 7 ms (Rh). The relaxation times are consistent with H\xe2\x88\x92H bond lengths of 0.88\xe2\x88\x921.11 \xc3\x85 in the iridium complexes and 0.73\xe2\x88\x920.92 \xc3\x85 in the rhodium complexes depending on the relative rate of the dihydrogen rotational motion. In the case of the iridium complexes, partial substitution of the hydride positions with deuterium or tritium results in large temperature-dependent isotope shifts and resolvable JH-D or JH-T coupling constants. Analysis of the chemical shift and coupling constant data as a function of temperature is consistent with a preference for the heavy hydrogen isotope to occupy the hydride rather than the dihydrogen site. This analysis also provides the limiting chemical shifts of the dihydrogen and hydride ligands as well as the 1JH-D coupling constant (ca. 25 Hz) in the bound dihydrogen ligand. "
"Addition of two or more equivalents of LiPPhH to [N3N]MCl ([N3N]3- = [(Me3SiNCH2CH2)3N]3-; M = Mo or W) produced [N3N]M\xe2\x8b\xaeP complexes via intermediate [N3N]M(PPhH) complexes. The reaction between [N3N]MoCl and 2 equiv of LiAsPhH in the absence of light gave a mixture of [N3N]Mo\xe2\x8b\xaeAs (\xe2\x88\xbc30% yield) and [N3N]MoPh. [N3N]Mo\xe2\x8b\xaeN and [N3N]W\xe2\x8b\xaeN were both prepared via decomposition of intermediate azide complexes. Tungsten nitrido, phosphido, or arsenido complexes react readily with methyl triflate in toluene to give the cationic methyl imido, methyl phosphinidene, and methyl arsinidene complexes, respectively. Addition of methyl triflate or trimethylsilyl triflate to [N3N]Mo\xe2\x8b\xaeN yields the cationic imido complexes {[N3N]MoNMe}OTf and {[N3N]MoNSiMe3}OTf, respectively, but {[N3N]Mo=PMe}OTf is not stable in solution at room temperature for more than 1\xe2\x88\x922 h. The reaction between \xe2\x80\x9c[Rh(CO)2(CH3CN)2]PF6\xe2\x80\x9d and 2 equiv of [N3N]Mo\xe2\x8b\xaeP or [N3N]W\xe2\x8b\xaeP gave red, crystalline adducts that contain two [N3N]M\xe2\x8b\xaeP \xe2\x80\x9cligands\xe2\x80\x9d, e.g., [Rh{[N3N]W\xe2\x8b\xaeP}2(CO)(CH3CN)]+, while red, crystalline [Rh{[N3N]W\xe2\x8b\xaeAs}2(CO)(CH3CN)]PF6 could be prepared by an analogous route. {[N3N]MoNSiMe3}OTf could be reduced to \xe2\x80\x9c19-electron\xe2\x80\x9d [N3N]MoNSiMe3, while addition of MeMgCl to {[N3N]MoNSiMe3}OTf or {[N3N]MoNMe}OTf yielded complexes of the type [N3N]Mo(NR)(Me). The complex in which R = Me was unstable with respect to loss of methane and formation of the iminato complex, [N3N]Mo(NCH2). Both [N3NF]W(PPhH) and [N3NF]Mo(PPhH) ([N3NF]3- = [(C6F5NCH2CH2)3N]3-) could be prepared readily, but all attempts to prepare [N3NF]W\xe2\x8b\xaeP failed. X-ray studies of [N3N]W\xe2\x8b\xaeP, [N3N]Mo(PPhH), [N3N]Mo\xe2\x8b\xaeAs, {[N3N]WAsMe}OTf, [Rh{[N3N]W\xe2\x8b\xaeP}2(CO)(CH3CN)]+, and [N3N]Mo=NSiMe3 are presented and discussed. "
"Kinetic and mechanistic studies on the deoxygenation of nitroarenes by Ru(dppe)(CO)3, where dppe = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, are described. The products of the reaction included 1 equiv of carbon dioxide and an \xce\xb72-nitrosoarene ruthenium complex (Ru(dppe)(CO)2[ON(Ar)] for Ar = 4-chloro-2-trifluoromethylphenyl), which was isolated and fully characterized by solution spectroscopic methods and by single crystal X-ray diffraction [monoclinic crystal system, space group P21/c (#14), a = 14.556 (8) \xc3\x85, b = 12.903 (6) \xc3\x85, c = 20.10 (1) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 105.60 (6)\xc2\xb0, V = 3636 (8) \xc3\x853, Z = 4]. The deoxygenation reaction was determined to be first-order with respect to both Ru(dppe)(CO)3 and nitroarene. Electron withdrawing substituents on the nitroarene and polar solvents accelerated the rate, and a substituent study provided a \xcf\x81 of +3.45 indicating negative charge buildup on the nitroarene in the rate determining step of the reaction. Activation enthalpies for 2-CF3, 4-Cl, 4-H, and 4-CH3 substituted nitroarenes were 9.3, 9.9, 10.5, and 10.7 kcal mol-1, and the entropies of activation were \xe2\x88\x9235, \xe2\x88\x9233, \xe2\x88\x9236, and \xe2\x88\x9237 eu, respectively. Correlation between the reduction potentials of the nitroarenes (E\xc2\xb0ArNO2) and log k2 was also observed for substituted nitroarenes yielding a slope of 10 V-1. Monosubstituted nitroarenes bearing a single methyl, phenyl, or chloro group in the ortho position and disubstituted 2,6-dimethyl- and 2,3-dichloronitrobenzene showed no attenuation in the rate, from what would be expected based on the E\xc2\xb0ArNO2 \xe2\x88\x92 log k2 correlation. Large rate attenuation was observed for nitroarenes bearing both ortho and meta groups. Analysis of the kinetic and thermodynamic data using Marcus theory indicated that the rates were too high for an outer-sphere electron-transfer mechanism. The data were interpreted in terms of an inner-sphere electron-transfer mechanism where the unfavorable energetics are mitigated by bonding interactions between the donor and acceptor. "
"This paper describes a novel chemical method for controlled assembly of regular composite nanowire arrays at the molecular level. The polycationic poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PNVK) template is prepared by electrochemical polymerization of the N-vinylcarbazole monomer. Regular composite nanowire arrays of thallic oxide (Tl2O3) and polycationic PNVK are fabricated through ordered aggregation of the negative Tl2O3 nanoparticles along the positive chains of the polycationic PNVK in the polycationic PNVK\xe2\x88\x92arachidic acid (AA) mixed monolayer on the air\xe2\x88\x92alkaline Tl2O3 sol interface. The widths of the Tl2O3 and the polycationic PNVK nanowires are 3.2 and 2.7 nm, respectively. The above regular nanowire arrays can also be obtained when a polycationic PNVK single component is used as a template. These nanowires lie in the plane of the corresponding monolayers. The polycationic PNVK\xe2\x88\x92AA mixed monolayer and the Tl2O3 nanowire arrays aggregated along the polycationic PNVK chains can be easily transferred onto hydrophobic substrates layer by layer to form Langmuir\xe2\x88\x92Blodgett (LB) multilayers with a spacing of 5.5 nm. This novel method should be applicable to the preparation of a wide range of composite nanowire arrays. "
"The transient intermediates in the nanosecond laser flash photolysis of ketoprofen, an aryl propionic acid, show the formation of a carbanion in aqueous solutions at pH 7.1. This carbanion incorporates spectroscopic properties from both a ketyl radical anion and a benzylic radical. The ketoprofen carboxylate undergoes biphotonic photoionization, a process that contributes less than 10% to its photodecomposition and leads to a benzylic-type radical after decarboxylation with a rate constant \xe2\x89\xa51 \xc3\x97 107 s-1. On the other hand, the carbanion forms monophotonically and the unsuccessful attempts to sensitize the formation of the ketoprofen triplet excited state in aqueous solutions suggest that the carbanion precursor is either an excited singlet state or an extremely short-lived triplet. In organic solvents of lower polarity, the excited triplet state is readily detectable. "
"In order to clarify mechanisms of excited state interactions in hydrogen-bonded pairs, we have studied the kinetics of dynamic quenching of singlet and triplet fluorenone by a series of alcohols, phenols, and related compounds, in which hydrogen-bonding power, redox potential, and acidity are systematically varied. In addition, effects of solvent basicity or polarity and deuteration help identify the role of hydrogen-bonding in physical or chemical quenching processes. Alcohols and weak acids, with high oxidation potentials, do not quench the triplet, but quench the singlet at rates which parallel hydrogen-bonding power. This is attributed to a physical mechanism, involving vibronic coupling to the ground state via the hydrogen bond. This is much stronger in the excited state than in the ground state, and provides efficient energy dissipation in the radiationless transition. Phenols, with hydrogen-bonding power comparable to that of the alcohols but with much lower oxidation potentials, quench both singlet and triplet by electron or H-atom transfer, depending on potentials, acidities, and solvent polarity, as shown by formation of anion or neutral fluorenone radicals from the triplet. Rates increase with both decreasing oxidation potential of the phenol and increasing acidity of the incipient cation radical. Quenching proceeds via a hydrogen-bonded complex and is facilitated by proton transfer contributions to the effective excited state redox potential. "
"Quantum mechanical ab initio calculations at the HF and MP2 levels of theory with valence basis sets up to TZ+2P quality are reported for the Y-conjugated silylium cations [Si(XH)3]+ and the di- and monosubstituted analogues [HSi(XH)2]+ and [H2Si(XH)]+ (X = O\xe2\x88\x92Te). The X\xe2\x86\x92Si p(\xcf\x80) donation and the thermodynamic stabilization increase in the order O < S < Se < Te. This trend is given by the calculated complexation energies of the water complexes and the reaction energies of isodesmic reactions. A comparison with the respective carbenium ions shows that the chalcogen substituents stabilize the carbenium ions more than the silylium ions. While the stabilization of the carbenium ions by chalcogens from O to Te remains nearly the same, it strongly varies within the series of silylium ions in the order Te > Se > S > O. The silylium ions and the carbenium ions are more strongly stabilized by the chalcogens than by the respective halogen atom. The analysis of the Si\xe2\x88\x92X bonds in [Si(XH)3]+ shows that the covalent character increases from Si\xe2\x88\x92O to Si\xe2\x88\x92Te, which has a nearly unpolar bond. "
"A novel chemoenzymatic approach to synthesizing high-mannose-type N-glycopeptide and its C-linked glycopeptide analog is described. The synthesis consists of two steps:\xe2\x80\x89 a chemical synthesis of GlcNAc-containing peptides and an enzymatic glycosyl transfer of Man9GlcNAc to the terminal GlcNAc in the peptides in an aqueous medium containing organic solvents. The essential enzyme used is an endo-\xce\xb2-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase from Arthrobacter protophormiae (Endo-A). This approach should be generally applicable to the synthesis of both natural and designed high-mannose-type glycopeptides. It has been found that, while the natural high-mannose-type N-glycopeptide 2 can be rapidly hydrolyzed by glycoamidases [commonly called N-glycanase or, systematically, peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-\xce\xb2-d-glucosaminylasparagine amidase], the synthetic C-glycopeptide 1 with an insertion of a methylene group at the crucial asparagine\xe2\x88\x92GlcNAc linkage is resistant to the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis and shows apparent inhibitory activity toward glycoamidases of plant, bacterial, and animal origin, with the Ki values ranging from 1 to 160 \xce\xbcM for different enzymes. The C-glycopeptide 1 is the first, broad spectrum inhibitor for glycoamidases, which is expected to be a useful tool in the study of the mechanism and biological functions of the enzymes. "
"Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) on the yeast \xce\xb1-glucosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis of two \xce\xb1-d-glucopyranosyl pyridinium salts were measured at 25 \xc2\xb0C and pH = 6.8. The measured KIEs on kcat for the 2H-2, 13C-1, and 15N-1\xe2\x80\x98 labeled substrates \xce\xb1-d-glucopyranosyl pyridinium bromide (1) and \xce\xb1-d-glucopyranosyl isoquinolinium bromide (2) were, respectively, 1.115 \xc2\xb1 0.006 and 1.106 \xc2\xb1 0.009, 1.028 \xc2\xb1 0.006 and 1.027 \xc2\xb1 0.005, and 1.019 \xc2\xb1 0.007 and 0.985 \xc2\xb1 0.005. KIEs for the spontaneous hydrolysis of \xce\xb1-d-glucopyranosyl 4\xe2\x80\x98-bromoisoquinolinium bromide (3) were measured at 80 \xc2\xb0C and pH = 6.8. The measured KIEs on khyd for the 2H-1, 2H-2, 13C-1, and 15N-1\xe2\x80\x98 labeled substrate \xce\xb1-d-glucopyranosyl 4\xe2\x80\x98-bromoisoquinolinium bromide (3) were, respectively, 1.189 \xc2\xb1 0.009, 1.094 \xc2\xb1 0.010, 1.005 \xc2\xb1 0.002, and 1.015 \xc2\xb1 0.004. The KIEs obtained in this study of yeast \xce\xb1-glucosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions are consistent with a transition state which involves a small degree of nucleophilic attack by an enzyme active site carboxylate group at the anomeric carbon center, whereas the corresponding transition state for the uncatalyzed reaction in water does not involve any nucleophilic assistance. In addition, the equilibrium isotope effects for deprotonation of the conjugate acid (Ka14/Ka15) of isoquinoline was measured to be 1.0216 \xc2\xb1 0.0005. "
Fluorenyllithium (1) adds to tert-butyl isocyanate to yield 9-(N-tert-butylcarboxamido)fluorenyllithium (3). Its reduction with LiAlH4 followed by aqueous workup leads to the formation of the corresponding dibenzo-N-tert-butylaminofulvene 5. Treatment of 5 with sodium cyanoborohydride furnishes 9-(N-tert-butylaminomethyl)fluorene (6). Deprotonation of the fulvene 5 with n-butyllithium in ether yields the \xce\xb75-azapentadienyllithium derivative 11. The X-ray crystal structure analysis of 11\xc2\xb7(Et2O)2 reveals a nearly planar U-shaped 1-azapentadienyl moiety that exhibits five close contacts to the lithium atom located above the ligand plane. Computational chemistry (PM3) has identified the \xce\xb75-(1-azapentadienyl)lithium derivative 11 as a global minimum. In solution compound 11 undergoes a dynamic degenerate rearrangement process that is rapid on the 1H NMR time scale. It equilibrates the annulated arene moieties of 11. The Gibbs activation energy of this symmetrization process is \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7enant = 11.8 \xc2\xb1 0.3 kcal mol-1. A Cs-symmetric transition state geometry (11-TS) where the 1-azapentadienyl conjugation is interrupted between C9\xe2\x88\x92C10 was identified by the PM3 calculation. Deprotonation of 9-(N-tert-butylaminomethyl)fluorene (6) gives rise to several competing pathways. Treatment with lithium hexamethyldisilazide leads to abstraction of the fluorenyl 9-H proton to produce the aminomethyl-substituted fluorenyl anion 7. Subsequent treatment of 7 with tert-butyllithium gives the dilithio compound 10. The reaction of 6 with n-butyllithium leads to the formation of a mixture of fluorenyllithium (1) and the \xce\xb75-(1-azapentadienyl)lithium derivative 11. Deprotonation of 6 with tert-butyllithium furnishes 1 and the dilithiated compound 10. Single crystals of 1\xc2\xb7Et2O were analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The compound shows a polymeric \xe2\x80\x9csuper-sandwich\xe2\x80\x9d structure with an alternating fluorenyl-Li\xc2\xb7OEt2 arrangement exhibiting inversion symmetry. The X-ray crystal structure analysis of 10\xc2\xb7(THF)3 reveals an unsymmetrical arrangement of the lithium atoms at the amidomethylfluorenyl-\xe2\x80\x9cdianion\xe2\x80\x9d framework with one THF molecule bridging between the metal centers. The bonding features of the dilithiated system 10 derived by double deprotonation of 6 were also analyzed by computational chemistry. 
"The Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane adds to the (butadiene)group 4 metallocenes 1a\xe2\x88\x92d (metallocene = Cp2Zr, Cp2Hf, (MeCp)2Zr, (Me3CCp)2Zr) to give the metallocene\xe2\x88\x92(\xce\xbc-C4H6)\xe2\x88\x92borate\xe2\x88\x92betaine complexes 2a\xe2\x88\x92d. (Isoprene)zirconocene (1e) and (2-phenylbutadiene)zirconocene (1f) add the B(C6F5)3 reagent regioselectively at the carbon atom C-4 to give the complexes 2e and 2f, respectively. The complexes 2 all show a pronounced M\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7F\xe2\x88\x92C interaction with one of the six ortho-B(C6F5)3 fluorine atoms. The resulting metallacyclic structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction of the complexes 2c and 2e (Zr\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7F \xe2\x89\x88 2.40 \xc3\x85, angle Zr\xe2\x88\x92F\xe2\x88\x92C \xe2\x89\x88 140\xc2\xb0). The bridging fluorine atom of the complexes in solution is characterized by an extreme upfield shift of its 19F NMR resonance (\xce\xb4 \xe2\x89\x88 \xe2\x88\x92210 to \xe2\x88\x92220 ppm) relative to the signals of the remaining five o-F resonances of the B(C6F5)3 moiety (average \xce\xb4 \xe2\x89\x88 \xe2\x88\x92135 ppm). The 19F NMR spectra of the complexes 2 are dynamic even in the noncoordinating solvent toluene-d8. All six o-fluorine signals equilibrate with coalescence temperatures around 240 K at 564 MHz to give a single resonance signal at high temperature. This fluorine equilibration process of the \xe2\x88\x92B(C6F5)3 end of the metallocene\xe2\x88\x92borate\xe2\x88\x92betaine complexes 2 is very likely to proceed via a rate determining cleavage of the coordinative M\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7F\xe2\x88\x92C interaction. From the activation barrier of this process, obtained from the dynamic fluorine NMR spectra, Zr\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7F bond dissociation energies of ca. 8.5 kcal/mol were estimated for the complexes 2. This magnitude of the M\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7F\xe2\x88\x92C bond dissociation energy makes the internal fluorocarbon coordination a very suitable tool for protecting active electrophilic metal catalyst centers. The Zr\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7F\xe2\x88\x92C bond of the complexes 2 is cleaved by the addition of the donor solvent THF with formation of acyclic 1,2-\xce\xb72-allyl metallocene complexes. "
"Polymerization of propylene with bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride and bis(2-[3,5-bistrifluoromethyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride produces elastomeric polypropylene. The elastomeric properties of these polymers have been interpreted in terms of a stereoblock microstructure. Analysis of the microstructure by 13C NMR reveals isotactic pentad contents [mmmm] ranging from 6 to 74%. The hafnium derivatives were investigated to probe the influence of the transition metal on the polymerization behavior. The hafnium-based catalysts yield polypropylenes that are significantly less isotactic than the corresponding zirconium compounds, although molecular weights and productivities were similar for hafnium and zirconium derivatives. The X-ray crystal studies of these catalysts show nearly identical structures for corresponding zirconium and hafnium compounds. Variable temperature NMR of the metallocene dibenzyl analogues showed behavior consistent with rotation of indenyl ligands, where rotation of the indenyl ligand of bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dibenzyl was 6800 Hz and that of hafnium was 6700 Hz at 20 \xc2\xb0C. Based on our proposed mechanism of polymerization, the origin of the different microstructures can be ascribed to a faster propagation of the isospecific zirconium site relative to that of the isospecific hafnium site.

"Flash photolysis of 2-diazocyclohexane-1,3-dione in aqueous solution produced 2-ketocyclopentylideneketene, which hydrated to the enol of 2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylic acid, and the enol then isomerized to the keto form of the acid. This ketene proved to be a remarkably reactive substance, with an uncatalyzed hydration rate constant of k = 1.4 \xc3\x97 106 s-1 and a hydroxide-ion-catalyzed rate constant of 7.5 \xc3\x97 107 M-1 s-1; no acid catalysis of hydration was found. Ketonization of the enol was a slower process with rate constants in the millisecond to second range. The reaction shows a complex rate profile that could be interpreted in terms of rate-determining proton transfer to the \xce\xb2-carbon atom of successively ionized forms of the enol in successively more basic solutions. In concentrated acid solutions, the carboxylic acid group of the enol also underwent equilibrium protonation of its carbonyl group, with pKSH = \xe2\x88\x923.86. Acidity constants of the carboxylic acid group of the enol, pQa,E = 4.16, and the hydroxyl group of the enol, pQaE = 12.41, were also determined. (These acidity constants are concentration quotients applicable at an ionic strength of 0.10 M.) Rates of enolization of the keto form of the substrate were also measured by bromine scavenging, and these, in combination with ketonization rates, gave the keto\xe2\x88\x92enol equilibrium constants pKE = 2.51 for the system in the un-ionized carboxylic acid form and pK\xe2\x80\x98E = 3.00 for the ionized carboxylate form. The acidity constant of the carboxylic acid group of the keto form was determined as well:\xe2\x80\x89 pQa,K = 3.67. "
"The rational design of molecular photonic devices requires a thorough understanding of all factors affecting electronic communication among the various constituents. To explore how electronic factors mediate both excited- and ground-state electronic communication in multiporphyrin arrays, we have conducted a detailed static spectroscopic (absorption, fluorescence, resonance Raman, electron paramagnetic resonance), time-resolved spectroscopic (absorption, fluorescence), and electrochemical (cyclic and square-wave voltammetry, coulometry) study of tetraarylporphyrin dimers. The complexes investigated include both zinc-free base (ZnFb) and bis-Zn dimers in which the porphyrin constituents are linked via diphenylethyne groups at the meso positions. Comparison of dimeric arrays containing pentafluorophenyl groups at all nonlinking meso positions (F30ZnFbU and F30Zn2U) with nonfluorinated analogs (ZnFbU and Zn2U) directly probes the effects of electronic factors on intradimer communication. The major findings of the study are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) Energy transfer from the photoexcited Zn porphyrin to the Fb porphyrin is the predominant excited-state reaction in F30ZnFbU, as is also the case for ZnFbU. Energy transfer primarily proceeds via a through-bond process mediated by the diarylethyne linker. Remarkably, the energy-transfer rate is 10 times slower in F30ZnFbU ((240 ps)-1) than in ZnFbU ((24 ps)-1), despite the fact that each has the same diphenylethyne linker. The attenuated energy-transfer rate in the former dimer is attributed to reduced Q-excited-state electronic coupling between the Zn and Fb porphyrins. (2) The rate of hole/electron hopping in the monooxidized bis-Zn complex, [F30Zn2U]+, is \xe2\x88\xbc10-fold slower than that for [Zn2U]+. The slower hole/electron hopping rate in the former dimer reflects strongly attenuated ground-state electronic coupling. The large attenuation in excited- and ground-state electronic communication observed for the fluorine-containing dimers is attributed to a diminution in the electron-exchange matrix elements that stems from stabilization of the a2u porphyrin orbital combined with changes in the electron-density distribution in this orbital. Stabilization of the porphyrin a2u orbital results in a switch in the HOMO from a2u in ZnFbU to a1u in F30ZnFbU. This orbital reversal diminishes the electron density at the peripheral positions where the linker is appended. Collectively, our studies clarify the origin of the different energy-transfer rates observed among various multiporphyrin arrays and exemplify the interconnected critical roles of a1u/a2u orbital ordering and linker position in the design of efficient molecular photonic devices.

"Emission from cis-1-(2-anthryl)-2-phenylethene, c-APE*, in toluene is resolved into 1t-APEB* and 1c-APE* components at temperatures ranging between 4.3 and 59.3 \xc2\xb0C. Decomposition of effective fluorescence quantum yields, \xcf\x86fc, into pure component fluorescence quantum yields, \xcf\x86ft-B and \xcf\x86fc, shows that \xcf\x86ft-B increases 24% with increasing temperature while \xcf\x86fc decreases more than 3-fold over this temperature range. On the basis of the fraction of molecules that escape the 1c-APE* potential energy minimum, 1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x86fc, the efficiency of adiabatic formation of 1t-APEB* remains remarkably temperature independent at 50.5 \xc2\xb1 0.7%. These results, together with photoisomerization quantum yields as a function of [c-APE] in degassed and air-saturated toluene, reveal a detailed photoisomerization mechanism. At infinite dilution and in the absence of molecular oxygen, photoisomerization of c-APE occurs predominantly via the adiabatic, conformer-specific 1c-APEB* \xe2\x86\x92 1t-APEB* pathway. This torsional motion experiences a 4.44 \xc2\xb1 0.14 kcal/mol barrier probably located at the perpendicular, 3p*, geometry. Since 12% of 1t-APEB* intersystem cross to 3t-APEB*, the known triplet state quantum chain process enhances photoisomerization quantum yields at higher [c-APE]. Triplets formed directly from 1c-APE* also contribute to this pathway. In air-saturated solutions, oxygen eliminates the quantum chain process by reducing the lifetime of 3t-APE*. However, the quenching of 1c-APE* by O2 gives 3c-APE*, thus enhancing photoisomerization quantum yields via rapid 3c-APE* \xe2\x86\x92 3t-APE* adiabatic torsional displacement. No photoisomerization of 1c-APEA* need be postulated to account for our observations. The enthalpy difference between ground state conformers, \xce\x94HAB, favors c-APEB by 0.92 \xc2\xb1 0.02 kcal/mol. "
"Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GID) has been applied to the study of structural characteristics of two-dimensional crystallites of the ionophores valinomycin (VM) and nonactin (NA) when complexed with various cations at the air-solution interface. The VM complexes assume a bracelet shape that packs in a two-dimensional hexagonal unit cell. Other crystalline phases were formed on potassium iodide and barium perchlorate solutions. The presence of particular lipids induced ordered stacking of VM\xe2\x88\x92potassium chloride complexes into three to four layers. NA packs in a pseudotetragonal unit cell on solutions of NH4SCN and KSCN. Upon compression of the NA\xe2\x88\x92NH4SCN film, crystallites seven to eight layers thick were detected and the GID data enabled the determination of the structure. The tendency of these complexed ionophores to form multilayer crystallites at interfaces may have bearing on ion transport through membranes, via stacking. "
"The title question is addressed by low-temperature 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectroscopies in CD2Cl2 as well as by the preparation of authentic samples from glycopyranosyl bromides and AgOTf.

Glycosyl triflates were generated at \xe2\x88\x9278 \xc2\xb0C in CD2Cl2 and allowed to warm gradually until decomposition was detected by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy. The decomposition temperature and products are functions of the protecting groups employed. "
"This article describes a highly effective catalytic asymmetric epoxidation method for olefins using potassium peroxomonosulfate (Oxone, Dupont) as oxidant and a fructose-derived ketone (1) as catalyst. High enantioselectivies have been obtained for trans-disubstituted and trisubstituted olefins which can bear functional groups such as tributylsilyl ether, acetal, chloride, and ester. The enantiomeric excesses for cis-olefins and terminal olefins are not high yet. The current epoxidation shows that the catalyst efficiency is enhanced dramatically upon raising the pH. Mechanistic studies show that the epoxidation mainly proceeds via a spiro transition state, which provides a model for predicting the stereochemical outcome of the reaction. The planar transition state is likely to be the main competing pathway. The extent of the involvement of the planar mode is subject to the steric effect of the alkyl groups on the olefins. "
"Reactions of ruthenium silylene complexes of the type [Cp*(PMe3)2RuSiR2]+ with unsaturated compounds were investigated. Nonpolar, unsaturated substrates such as ethylene, acetylene, and 2-butyne do not react with [Cp*(PMe3)2RuSiR2]B(C6F5)4 (1a, R = Me; 1b, R = Ph). However, methyl isocyanate inserts into an Si\xe2\x88\x92S bond of the silylene complex [Cp*(PMe3)2RuSi(STol)2][BPh4] (5) to give the 1,2-dipolar addition product {Cp*(PMe3)2RuSi(STol)[\xce\xb72\xe2\x88\x92O(MeN)C(STol)]}[BPh4] (6a) in 87% yield. This product was characterized by X-ray crystallography as possessing a base-stabilized silylene ligand with thiolate and thiocarbamate substituents. Compound 1a reacts with methyl and phenyl isocyanate to give the 2 + 2  R = Me; 8, R = Ph). The analogous triflate  R = Ph; 10, R = Me) were prepared by reaction of the appropriate ruthenium silyls Cp*(PMe3)2RuSiR2OTf with methyl isocyanate. Heating 9 to 100 \xc2\xb0C in toluene resulted in dissociation of the isocyanate and regeneration of the triflate Cp*(PMe3)2RuSiPh2OTf. Competition reactions of various para-substituted phenyl isocyanates with 1b show that the rate of cycloaddition increases with the electron-donating ability of the incoming isocyanate. This is consistent with a stepwise cycloaddition mechanism involving initial coordination of the isocyanate nitrogen atom to the Lewis acidic silylene silicon atom. "
"Ruthenacyclobutane complexes (SiP3)(PMe3)Ru(CH2EMe2CH2) (SiP3 = MeSi(CH2PMe2)3; 1, E = C; 2, E = Si) were synthesized from (SiP3)(PMe3)RuCl2 (3) and 2 equiv of the Grignard reagents, Me3ECH2MgCl. Metallacycle 1 was found to reversibly interconvert with the allyl complex (SiP3)Ru(Me)(\xce\xb73-CH2CMeCH2) (4) and PMe3 when heated above 75 \xc2\xb0C. From the results of kinetic studies and thermolysis of labeled material, the interconversion is proposed to take place by reversible \xce\xb2-methyl elimination/insertion. Conversion of 1 to 4 is an endothermic process (\xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 = 14.3 \xc2\xb1 1.1 kcal mol-1), but it is entropically favorable (\xce\x94S\xc2\xb0 = 40.9 \xc2\xb1 2.8 cal K-1 mol-1) due to the loss of the PMe3 ligand. Activation parameters for the \xce\xb2-insertion were determined to be \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 26.0 \xc2\xb1 1.2 kcal mol-1 and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9210.5 \xc2\xb1 0.9 cal K-1 mol-1. Allyl complex 4 has been isolated as a mixture of isomers (7:1 endo:exo). The mechanism of interconversion of 4endo and 4exo was determined by 1H{31P} NMR spectroscopy (EXSY) to be a process involving a stereochemically rigid, square-pyramidal \xce\xb71-intermediate. Thermolysis of 4 leads to loss of CH4 and the production of the trimethylenemethane complex (SiP3)Ru(\xce\xb74-C(CH2)3) (7). The solid state structures of 1 and 7 were determined by X-ray diffraction. "
"The effect of dimethyl ether solvation on aggregated forms of the lithium enolate of acetaldehyde (CH2CHOLi)n(Me2O)x, n = 1\xe2\x88\x924, x = 0\xe2\x88\x924, was studied theoretically. Density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP functional was applied to calculate the energies of PM3 optimized structures (B3LYP//PM3). The accuracy of this method was checked successfully against a representative set of B3LYP//B3LYP computations. The DFT values also were calibrated by comparison with MP4 calculations on solvated methyllithium. The structures and energies of the aggregates are described, with emphasis on the main factors that control relative stabilities. Common crystal structure motivs are reproduced. Solvation is critical in the equilibria among the aggregated species and in the relative stabilities of the tetrameric isomers but is balanced by \xcf\x80-interactions between lithium and the enolate double bond. A number of tetramer structures were studied, but lithium is tetracoordinated only in the cubic tetramer in the most stable solvated form. Aggregation and successive solvation energies as well as entropy considerations indicate that solution equilibria are dominated by the solvated monomer and tetramer. The disolvated monomer is remarkably stable; addition of a third solvent is far less exothermic than the first two additions and may not suffice to compensate for the corresponding entropy change. Natural population analysis (NPA) suggests that polarization rather than delocalization of charge from oxygen into the enolate double bond is the main mechanism of charge distribution. Previously known experimental aggregation data on lithium enolates are rationalized by the computational results obtained. "
"The concept of maintaining spatial congruence between substrate binding site and regions of greatest enantiodifferentiation to ensure efficient chiral recognition in host\xe2\x88\x92guest chemistry is described in this paper. Regions of maximum chiral recognition were located by determining Boltzmann-weighted intermolecular energies of chiral probe molecules placed at well-defined grid points around a molecule and then evaluating the magnitude of (dis)similarity of interaction at each grid point. Sites having little or no energy differences between enantiomeric probes are nondiscriminatory while those of greatest energy difference correspond to regions of maximum chiral discrimination. Seven analyte molecules containing a diverse set of organic functional groups were evaluated when binding to permethylated \xce\xb2-cyclodextrin, a popular chiral stationary phase used in chromatography. The preferred binding site for host\xe2\x88\x92guest association is the interior of the cyclodextrin, and the region of maximum discrimination is found to coincide with this location for all analytes studied. Forcing the guests to bind to the exterior of the macrocycle by blocking the interior of the cyclodextrin is predicted to reduce or eliminate resolution. A literature report confirming this prediction is cited. "
"High-level ab initio and density functional theory calculations have been used to investigate the dependence of the strength of a typical low-barrier hydrogen bond on geometrical distortions. In gas phase simulations, HF/ 6-31+G(d,p), MP2/6-31+G(d,p), and B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level calculations reveal that the short-strong hydrogen bond formed between a formic acid molecule and a formate anion is very sensitive to both the hydrogen bond length and the hydrogen bond angle. A 0.5 \xc3\x85 lengthening of the low-barrier hydrogen bond results in a weakening of that bond by over 6 kcal/mol. A 1.0 \xc3\x85 lengthening of the hydrogen bond results in an approximately 12 kcal/mol decrease in the calculated strength of the corresponding hydrogen bond. Similarly, an angle bending distortion of the hydrogen bond by as little as 30\xc2\xb0 can lead to a weakening of the hydrogen bond interaction by more than 5 kcal/mol. Implications for enzyme catalysis are discussed. "
"The major goal of this project was to use FT-IR spectroscopy to monitor the effects of chain length and temperature on small, helix-forming peptides of the general form, Ac-W(EAAAR)nA-NH2, where n = 1, 3, 5, and 7, in aqueous solutions. FT-IR spectra were collected in D2O as a function of temperature in the range of \xe2\x88\x924 to 95 \xc2\xb0C. The spectral range of interest, 1500\xe2\x88\x921725 cm-1, contains the amide-I\xe2\x80\x98 band of the fully-exchanged H \xe2\x86\x92 D peptide bond. Even in these simple peptides, the amide-I\xe2\x80\x98 region of the IR spectra is complex and congested, composed of features derived from the conformation of the peptide backbone and from the contributions of amino acid side chains. Unambiguous resolution of peak positions and intensities is thus extremely difficult, particularly when assessing subtle differences between two data sets. Two-dimensional correlation analysis (Noda, I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989, 111, 8116. Noda, I. Applied Spectrosc. 1990, 44, 550) was used to guide and verify the results of the peak-fitting procedure and thereby facilitate physical interpretation of the temperature-dependent spectra. The results of the two-dimensional analysis and fitting procedure show that the spectral bands, particularly those of the amide-I\xe2\x80\x98 band, exhibit significant frequency shifts and bandwidth and intensity changes as a function of temperature and chain length. For the amide-I\xe2\x80\x98 modes arising from the helical and random conformations of the peptide bond, the normalization of peak intensities to units of molar absorptivity is discussed in terms of different models. Two different molar absorptivity calculations are presented, the first using the length-dependence of \xce\xb1-helical frequencies as predicted by perturbation theory, and the second assuming a more rigorous two-state transition. The results from each are discussed in terms of the effects of chain length on \xce\xb1-helix stabilization and in terms of a mechanism of helix unfolding. "
"Treatment of a variety of 1,2-dien-7-ynes with a slight excess of (\xce\xb72-propene)Ti(O-i-Pr)2 (1), prepared in situ from Ti(O-i-Pr)4 and 2 equiv of i-PrMgCl in ether, afforded 1-alkenyl-2-alkylidenecyclopentanes in moderate to good yields after aqueous workup. The intermediate titanabicycle such as 7 was identified by deuterolysis, which gave d2-8 with exclusive deuterium incorporation. The use of an optically active allene such as 19 (\xe2\x89\xa483% ee) realized a highly efficient axial to centered chirality transfer to give 21 (80\xe2\x88\x9283% ee). Analogously, the cyclization of 22 (\xe2\x89\xa486% ee) with 1 followed by carbonylation (under ca. 1 atm of CO) afforded the optically active bicyclic ketone 25 (86% ee). When a homologous 1,2-dien-6-yne 27 was subjected to the cyclization as above, a different type of titanabicycle 28 was generated, which was identified by hydrolysis giving 29 or the following carbonyl addition. Upon reaction with nonanal, 28 afforded the alcohol 32 with very high regio- (with respect to the allylic system), stereo- (the diene moiety), and diastereoselectivities (the hydroxy group). Various 1,2-dien-6-ynes underwent the cyclization followed by the addition to carbonyl compounds in comparable selectivities as above. Chiral 1,2-dien-6-ynes 46 (\xe2\x89\xa483% ee) achieved a nearly complete chirality transfer to generate a chiral titanabicycle 48, which, in turn, reacted with nonanal, acetone, or N-benzylidenepropylamine to afford the alcohols 51 and 52 (both in 80% ee) or the amine 53 (81% ee) in good yields with a very small loss of the enantiopurity.

An approach for the construction of diffusion-limited size-selective sensors is described based on the self-assembly of cyclic peptides into tubular channels in organosulfur self-assembled monolayers on gold films. An eight-residue cyclic peptide of alternating units of d-Leu and l-Trp amino acid residues was incorporated into monolayers of dodecanethiol and octadecyl sulfide and shown to adopt highly oriented tubular structures under specified adsorption conditions. The structural properties of monolayer-supported peptide nanotubes have been analyzed by grazing angle FTIR spectroscopy and their selective ion transport activities by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. 
"We present the first comparative study of 17O and 18O isotope effects in a dioxygen-dependent enzymatic reaction. The binding of dioxygen to soybean lipoxygenase is expected to be near the diffusive limit, introducing the possibility of a magnetic isotope effect with 17O reacting faster than 16O. However, the experimental data indicate a purely mass effect among the 16O, 17O, and 18O isotopes. A reaction mechanism for soybean lipoxygenase is proposed in which dioxygen undergoes reversible reaction with a substrate derived radical, followed by a slow release of the bound lipid hydroperoxide.

"KO-42, a polypeptide with 42 amino acid residues has been designed to fold into a hairpin helix\xe2\x88\x92loop\xe2\x88\x92helix motif that dimerizes and forms a four-helix bundle. The solution structure of the folded KO-42 dimer has been determined by NMR and CD spectroscopy and ultracentrifugation. On the surface of the folded polypeptide a reactive site has been engineered that is capable of catalyzing acyl-transfer reactions of reactive esters. The reactive site of KO-42 contains six histidine residues with perturbed pKa values. The pKas of His-15, His-30, and His-34 are close to 5, whereas those of His-11, His-19, and His-26 are close to 7, with nonideal titration curves. The second-order rate constant for the KO-42 catalyzed hydrolysis of mono-p-nitrophenyl fumarate at pH 4.1 and 290 K is 0.1 M-1 s-1, which is 1140 times larger than that of the 4-methylimidazole (4-MeIm) catalyzed reaction, 8.8 \xc3\x97 10-5 M-1 s-1. The second-order rate constant for the KO-42 catalyzed transesterification of mono-p-nitrophenyl fumarate to form the corresponding trifluoroethyl ester in 10 vol % trifluoroethanol at pH 4.1 and 290 K is 0.052 M-1 s-1 which is 620 times larger than that of the 4-MeIm catalyzed reaction, 8.4 \xc3\x97 10-5 M-1 s-1. KO-42 catalyzes the corresponding reactions of other p-nitrophenyl esters with similar rate enhancements. At pH 4.1 in aqueous solution where the rate constant ratio k2(KO-42)/k2(4-MeIm) is larger than 103 the predominant reactive species of KO-42 have unprotonated histidines flanked by protonated histidines. The kinetic solvent isotope effect at pH 4.7 is 2.0 which shows that isotopic fractionation occurs in the transition state. The kinetic solvent isotope effect at pH 6.1 is 1.1 which shows that there is neither general acid\xe2\x88\x92general base catalysis nor strong hydrogen bonding in the transition state of the rate-limiting reaction step at that pH. The results suggest that at low pH the dominant catalytic species functions through a mechanism where unprotonated nucleophilic histidines are flanked by protonated histidines that bind to one or both of the ester oxygens in the transition state.

"Emphasis was placed in this work on the measurement of purine oxidation products generated upon nano- and picosecond UV laser biphotonic photolysis of 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyadenosine, 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine, calf thymus DNA, and a synthetic duplex oligonucleotide (37-mer) in aerated aqueous solutions. The overall formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyadenosine was determined using a HPLC-electrochemical detection assay. Denaturing gel electrophoresis analysis in association with a formamidopyrimidine\xe2\x88\x92DNA glycosylase treatment was applied to reveal the sites recognized by this DNA repair enzyme. Both 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyadenosine were shown to be minor decomposition products of the related nucleoside purine radical cations in agreement with earlier observations. Interestingly, a dramatic increase in the yield of both photoproducts, this applying particularly to 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine, was observed in DNA. It should be noted that the yield of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine was about 3-fold lower in heat-denatured DNA than in double-stranded DNA. These observations provide strong support to the significant involvement of base stacking and probably DNA solvatation in the chemical reactions of the purine radical cations. Other interesting information dealt with the similarity in the level of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine and the number of formamidopyrimidine\xe2\x88\x92DNA glycosylase sensitive guanine lesions. This strongly suggests that the latter formamidopyrimidine\xe2\x88\x92DNA glycosylase purine nucleoside is the major DNA photodamaged product recognized by the DNA repair glycosylase. Another striking feature is the almost 10-fold decrease in the saturation dose Es for the two-quantum ionization of the guanine base in double-stranded DNA as compared to that observed for free 2\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyguanosine. This can be explained by either an enhancement of the quantum yield of photoionization from the intermediate excited state in DNA (\xcf\x862) and/or hole migration with preferential trapping by guanine residues.

"Evidence is presented that the formation of aryl vinyl sulfide cation radicals from the corresponding neutral precursors via reaction with tris(4-bromophenyl)aminium hexachloroantimonate in the context of a cation radical Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder addition to 1,3-cyclopentadiene does not occur via outer sphere electron transfer but by a mechanism involving strong covalent interaction between the aminium salt acting as an electrophile and the aryl vinyl sulfide substrate acting as a nucleophile.

"Kinetic studies including the evaluation of deuterium kinetic isotope effects and Arrhenius activation energies implicate an addition\xe2\x88\x92elimination mechanism for the proton transfer reaction between 9-methylanthracene radical cation and 2,6-lutidine in acetonitrile\xe2\x88\x92Bu4NPF6 (0.1 M) and in dichloromethane\xe2\x88\x92Bu4NPF6 (0.2 M). Isotopic substitution of D for H at the 10-position results in inverse deuterium kinetic isotope effects (kH/kD) equal to 0.83 due to nucleophilic attack on the radical cation by 2,6-lutidine. Primary kH/kD of 3.5\xe2\x88\x925.9 were observed for D3 substitution in the 9-methyl group. The addition\xe2\x88\x92elimination mechanism involves unimolecular rearrangement of the initially formed adduct to give the product of proton transfer, 9-anthracenylmethyl radical. Oxidation of the latter followed by reaction with 2,6-lutidine affords N-(9-anthracenylmethyl)-2,6-lutidinium ion, which was isolated as the perchlorate salt. A comparison of kinetic data from reactions of both 9-methyl and 9,10-dimethylanthracene radical cations with pyridine and 2,6-lutidine results in the conclusion that in the absence of severe steric effects, radical cation\xe2\x88\x92nucleophile combination is kinetically favored over direct proton transfer for these radical cations.

"The resting state of nitrogenase shows an S = 3/2 electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal resulting from the FeMo-cofactor (M-center; inorganic portion, [Mo, Fe7, S9]) of the MoFe-protein. When the enzyme undergoes turnover under a CO atmosphere, this signal disappears and two new ones appear:\xe2\x80\x89 one under low pressure of CO (denoted lo-CO; 0.08 atm) with g = [2.09, 1.97, 1.93] and the other under high pressure of CO (denoted hi-CO; 0.5 atm) with g = [2.06, 2.06, 2.17]. Our recent Q-band (35 GHz) 57Fe and 13C electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) studies clearly identified [FeMo-cofactor][CO]n, as the origin of the EPR signals from both lo-CO (n = 1) and hi-CO (n = 2) [Christie, P. D.; Lee, H. I.; Cameron, L. M.; Hales, B. J.; Orme-Johnson, W. H.; Hoffman, B. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 8707\xe2\x88\x928709 and Pollack, R. C.; Lee, H. I.; Cameron, L. M.; Derose, V. J.; Hales, B. J.; Orme-Johnson, W. H.; Hoffman, B. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 8686\xe2\x88\x928687], and a previous paper discusses CO binding in detail [Lee, H. I.; Cameron, L. M.; Hales, B. J.; Hoffman, B. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 10121\xe2\x88\x9210126]. We now present complete orientation-selective 57Fe ENDOR measurements of the CO-bound FeMo-cofactor in both lo- and hi-CO forms of the MoFe-protein from Azotobacter vinelandii. The 57Fe ENDOR signals associated with the seven Fe ions of the FeMo-cofactor of lo-CO can be completely assigned and interpreted in terms of four magnetically distinct iron signals. Analysis of these signals following the procedures of Mouesca et al. [Mouesca, J.-M.; Noodleman, L.; Case, D. A.; Lamotte, B. Inorg. Chem. 1995, 34, 4347\xe2\x88\x924359] has led us to propose valence assignments and charges for the cofactor cluster, [Mo, Fe7, S9]+ = [Mo4+, Fe3+1, Fe2+6, S2-9]+, organized into one Fe2.5+ pair and five Fe2+ ions, [Mo4+, (2Fe2.5+)1, Fe2+5, S2-9]+. The result is a formal d-electron count of 43. ENDOR and functional studies indicate that the lo-CO, hi-CO, and resting states of the M-center are all at the same oxidation level. Hence, the proposed valency assignments apply to all three states. "
"The tetratungstate polyoxoanion-supported organometallic compound 2CH3CN\xe2\x8a\x82(n-Bu4N)2[{Ir(1,5-COD)}6W4O16]\xc2\xb72CH3CN (2CH3CN\xe2\x8a\x821\xc2\xb72CH3CN) is reported, a complex which exhibits an unusual \xe2\x80\x9cmethyl-first\xe2\x80\x9d CH3CN inclusion (\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x8a\x82\xe2\x80\x9d) chemistry. The synthesis of 2CH3CN\xe2\x8a\x821\xc2\xb72CH3CN was accomplished by the reaction of 3 equiv of [Ir(1,5-COD)Cl]2 with 4 equiv of (n-Bu4N)2WO4; an X-ray diffraction single-crystal structure shows that the four tungsten atoms in of 2CH3CN\xe2\x8a\x821\xc2\xb72CH3CN are located in tetrahedral positions and combine with four bridging oxygens to yield a tungsten-oxygen cubane structure. The cubane core tungsten atoms are capped by six surrounding [Ir(1,5-COD)]+ groups in an octahedral arrangement relative to the cube, with each [Ir(1,5-COD)]+ group coordinated by two terminal oxygen atoms from the tetratungstate unit. Two sets of flexible acetonitrile-binding cavities, formed between each three of the six [Ir(1,5-COD)]+ groups, form a roughly tetrahedral array surrounding the cube. This host-guest complex binds acetonitrile methyl-first, that is, with the methyl group rather than the nitrile group oriented toward a cubane core oxygen atom. The CMe\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O nonbonded distances fall in the range 3.10\xe2\x88\x924.46 \xc3\x85 for CMe\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7(\xce\xbc2-O) and 3.08\xe2\x88\x924.02 \xc3\x85 for CMe\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7(\xce\xbc3-O). Acetonitrile-free 1 was also prepared, and its possible acetonitrile and toluene complexation in benzene and methylene chloride solution was studied by NMR. No binding between acetonitrile or toluene and 1 in solution is observed, even when using greater than 300 mol equiv of guest relative to 1. Therefore, the host-guest interaction between 1 and acetonitrile appears to be weak (Keq < 10 M-1), possibly being limited to the solid state. "
"Absorption spectra of substituted carotenoids with varying acceptor strength are analyzed using collective electronic normal modes obtained using the time-dependent Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock (TDHF) technique combined with the INDO/S semiempirical Hamiltonian. Two-dimensional plots of the collective excitations in real space show an off-diagonal size associated with relative motion of electron-hole pairs created upon optical excitation and a diagonal size representing the pair\'s center of mass motion. By varying the polyene chain length we show that the response of symmetric molecules is controlled by \xe2\x80\x9cbulk\xe2\x80\x9d delocalized excitations with coherence size \xe2\x88\xbc12 double bonds, whereas the response of short polar molecules is dominated by a localized \xe2\x80\x9ccharge-transfer\xe2\x80\x9d excitation created at the acceptor end with coherence and diagonal lengths \xe2\x88\xbc12 and \xe2\x88\xbc17 double bonds, respectively.

"Synthetic pathways to several salts of the anion [Cp*2ZrH3]- have been developed. Reaction of Cp*2ZrH2 (3) prepared from [Cp*2Zr(N2)]2(\xce\xbc-N2) (2), with KH in THF, afforded [Cp*2ZrH3]K (1) in a 74% yield. In a similar manner, addition of LiH gave [Cp*2ZrH3]Li (4). While this synthetic pathway provides reproducible routes to 1and 4, purification of 2 is problematic. Another preparation involving the reaction of Cp*2ZrCl2 with 3 equiv of n-BuLi under H2 affords 4\xc2\xb70.5(LiCl\xc2\xb7THF). Alternatively, reaction of Cp*2ZrCl2 with LiAlH4 afforded the species Cp*2ZrH(\xce\xbc2-H2AlH2) (5) in virtually quantitative yield. Subsequent reaction of 5 with n-BuLi afforded the direct and high-yield conversion to 4. Deuteration and NMR studies infer attack of BuLi occurs at the Al center exclusively prompting transfer of a hydride to Zr and liberation of the Zr trihydride anion. Variable-temperature 1H NMR spectra and H/D scrambling experiments for 4 and 4-d3 are consistent with the hydride exchange process mediated by ion pairing while T1 studies infer a classical trihydride formulation is appropriate. Crystallographic studies of 4\xc2\xb70.5(LiCl\xc2\xb7THF), 5, and 4 also affirm cation\xe2\x88\x92anion pairing in 4 and 4\xc2\xb70.5(LiCl\xc2\xb7THF) and hydride bridging between Al and Zr in 5. "
"We designed various dialkylzinc hydride \xe2\x80\x9cate\xe2\x80\x9d complexes, prepared from dialkylzinc and metal hydride, and investigated the reactivities (and the transference aptitude of ligands) of these zincates toward benzophenone. The results clearly reveal that dimethylzinc hydrides are the most powerful and selective zincates for the reduction of the carbonyl group. This complex reagent turned out to be effective for the reduction of esters and amides as well as aldehydes and ketones to the corresponding alcohols and amines with good to excellent yields under mild conditions. Furthermore, the method was successfully used for the highly selective 1,2-reduction of \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, the regioselective ring-opening reduction of epoxides, and the chemoselective reduction of aldehydes in the presence of ketones. We also discuss and clarify the active species and the mechanism of this reduction using the diastereoselective reductions of some carbonyl compounds with an adjacent chiral center. Also, this reducing system was found to constitute a powerful tool for the stereoselective synthesis of syn- and anti-1,2-diols. Moreover, we developed the catalytic version of this reducing system. The LiH\xe2\x88\x92Me2Zn\xe2\x88\x92ultrasound system proved to be effective not only for the catalytic reduction of the carbonyl compounds and epoxides but also for the partial reduction (the conversion) of carboxylic acids to aldehydes. This system is a very attractive method for several reasons (good availability, low cost, and easy operation) and would be particularly useful for large-scale reductions. "
"The synthesis of a series of cyclic pentaoxyphosphoranes containing a sulfonyl group was carried out by the reaction of either P(OCH2CF3)3 or P(OPh)3 with the appropriate diol in an oxidative addition reaction:\xe2\x80\x89 O2S[(t-Bu)MeC6H2O]2P(OCH2CF3)3 (1), O2S[(t-Bu)MeC6H2O]2P(OPh)3 (2), O2S[(t-Bu)2C6H2O]2P(OCH2CF3)3 (4), and O2S[(t-Bu)2C6H2O]2P(OPh)3 (5). Reaction of 2 with catechol yielded O2S[(t-Bu)MeC6H2O]2P(OPh)(C6H4O2) (3). X-ray studies provided the structures of 1\xe2\x88\x925, although 4 was badly disordered. The geometries of 2, 3, and 5 are octahedral due to P\xe2\x88\x92O coordination provided by the sulfonyl group, whereas 1 and 4 are trigonal bipyramidal. Solution 31P, 1H, and 19F NMR spectra demonstrate that 1 and 4 exist in isomeric modifications. These are formulated as a pentacoordinate structure, as in the solid state, and a hexacoordinate structure. This represents the first study establishing intramolecular intraconversion between penta- and hexacoordinate isomers of phosphorus. An activation free energy of 17 kcal/mol for the exchange process for 1 and 4 was obtained from variable temperature 1H NMR spectra. "
"The electronic structures of [Fe(Por)(Im)O]1+ and [Fe(Por)(Im)O] (model compounds I and II, respectively) have been studied on the basis of density functional theory or DFT (Por = porphine, Im = imidazole). The a2u \xcf\x80-cation radical state (4A2u) was determined to be the ground state of compound I with total spin equal to 3/2, while the a1u \xcf\x80-cation state (4A1u) was found to be 0.15 eV higher in energy than the 4A2u state. Since, in both states, the spins were localized to the porphyrin ring (S = 1/2) and the Fe\xe2\x88\x92O center (S = 1), the magnetic coupling interaction between the two spin sites was examined by using a broken symmetry method. The calculated J value revealed very weak magnetic coupling for the A2u state, which corresponded to the experimental data. The calculated J value revealed strong antiferromagnetic coupling for the A1u state. The calculated M\xc3\xb6ssbauer spectrum parameters (quadrupole splitting and asymmetry) were similar for both the A1u and A2u states, and both agreed well with experimental values. On the other hand, the calculated hyperfine coupling constants for the nitrogen and the proton of the porphyrin ring were different in the two states. Although the experimental coupling constant values of the pyrrole nitrogen atoms were intermediate between the calculated values for the A2u and A1u states, the experimental values for the meso protons were closer to the values calculated for the A2u state. These results suggest that the electronic structure of compound I is closer to the A2u state than to the A1u state. However, these results also suggest that there is the possibility that the electronic structure of compound I is an admixture of the A1u state and the A2u state. The electronic structure of compound II was calculated and compared with the electronic structure of compound I. The energetics of the redox reaction between the two compounds is discussed. "
"G2 and G2MP2 calculations on the C2H6-nCln, C2H5-nCln\xe2\x80\xa2, and CH3-nCln\xe2\x80\xa2 species produce benchmark thermochemical data for homolytic C\xe2\x88\x92C, C\xe2\x88\x92H, and C\xe2\x88\x92Cl bond dissociations in ethane and its chloro derivatives. Without exception, the C\xe2\x88\x92H bonds are found to be stronger than the C\xe2\x88\x92C ones, which turn out to be barely stronger than their C\xe2\x88\x92Cl counterparts. The standard enthalpies of the homolytic C\xe2\x88\x92C, C\xe2\x88\x92H, and C\xe2\x88\x92Cl bond dissociations decrease sharply with the increasing number of chlorine atoms, the C\xe2\x88\x92C bonds being affected the most. Wherever available, experimental data confirm the reliability of the G2 calculations. The G2MP2 predictions are found to follow closely those of the G2 method. At the same time, the present study uncovers a very poor performance of the BLYP and B3LYP functionals for systems with strong repulsions between chlorine atoms. Analysis of the computed enthalpies of bond dissociation in terms of substituent contributions leads to the conclusion that this poor performance is caused by a systemic exaggeration of the H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Cl and Cl\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Cl repulsions. Most likely, this exaggeration is caused by the inability of the currently used density functionals to correctly describe dispersion interactions. "
"[Ru(phen)2dppz]2+ (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, dppz = dipyridophenazine) and closely related complexes have previously been observed to have an undetectably small quantum yield of photoluminescence in water but a moderate emission yield when bound to DNA. This so-called \xe2\x80\x9clight-switch\xe2\x80\x9d effect is a critical factor in the utility of these complexes as spectroscopic probes for DNA. Here we describe a detailed investigation of the photophysics of [Ru(phen)2dppz]2+ in aqueous solution, and in mixtures of acetonitrile and water, by time-resolved absorption and emission spectroscopies. The emission of the complex in water has been measured for the first time. A prompt initial emission, derived from a metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) excited state typical for polypyridyl\xe2\x88\x92ruthenium complexes, is observed along with a delayed emission attributed to a novel MLCT species. The small quantum yield of photoluminescence for [Ru(phen)2dppz]2+ in water, and in water/acetonitrile, depends upon efficient formation of a novel MLCT species, followed by its rapid radiationless decay. The MLCT interconversion is assigned to an intramolecular charge-transfer process that is induced by the polarity and proton donating ability of the solvent. "
"The encounter complex between photoexcited quinones Q* and various aromatic donors (ArH) is observed directly by time-resolved ps spectroscopy immediately before it undergoes electron transfer to the ion-radical pair [Q\xe2\x80\xa2-, ArH\xe2\x80\xa2+]. The encounter complex (EC) is spectrally characterized by distinctive (near IR) absorption bands, and its temporal evolution is established by quantitative kinetics analysis. The structural characterization of the 1:1 encounter complex [Q*, ArH] identifies the cofacial juxtaposition of the donor and acceptor moieties for optimal overlap of their \xcf\x80-orbitals. Further comparisons of the (excited-state) encounter complex with the corresponding (ground-state) EDA complex of aromatic donors and quinones establish its charge-transfer character, which directly relates to electron transfer within the encounter complex. The mechanistic significance of the encounter complex to bimolecular electron transfer is discussed (Scheme 1). "
"The hydrate of bromine was one of the first clathrate hydrates discovered. It has played a significant role in the development of the solid solution theory of clathrate hydrates, yet its detailed structure remains unknown. This hydrate again has become a test case for two different views of clathrates:\xe2\x80\x89 the solid solution model, after van der Waals and Platteeuw, that sees clathrates as unstable lattices which derive stability from a minimum degree of cage filling and thus are nonstoichiometric, and a view promoted by Dyadin and Aladko that all large cages in a hydrate structure need to be filled. In light of the latter view, existing data obtained over the last \xe2\x88\xbc160-year period on the composition and morphology of bromine hydrate would require the existence of four different hydrate structures. Our single crystal diffraction study of 16 different crystals of distinct compositions (Br2\xc2\xb78.62H2O to Br2\xc2\xb710.68H2O) and morphologies showed that there is just a single structure (tetragonal, P42/mnm, a = 23.04 \xc3\x85, c = 12.07 \xc3\x85, the structure originally proposed by Allen and Jeffrey) with considerable variation in the degree of occupancy of the large cages. The results favor the solid solution model for clathrates, and settle the question of long standing regarding the structure(s) of bromine hydrate. The bromine atoms occupy the large 14- and 15-hedral cages with up to 15 different crystallographically independent sites per cage and fractional occupancies from 0.19 to <\xe2\x88\xbc0.01. The bromine hydrate structure is unique, so far. 129Xe NMR results suggest that when attempts were made to produce a double hydrate of bromine and xenon, a transient cubic structure II hydrate resulted, which slowly converted to the tetragonal form. "
"High-level ab initio quantum chemical computations (MC-SCF and multireference M\xc3\xb8ller\xe2\x88\x92Plesset perturbation theory) have been used to investigate the composite relaxation path on three different singlet electronic states of an isolated all-trans-hexa-1,3,5-triene (trans-HT) molecule:\xe2\x80\x89 the spectroscopic Bu (valence-ionic) state, the lower lying dark (i.e. symmetry forbidden covalent) 2Ag state (S1), and finally the ground state (S0). Our results support the hypothesis that IVR (internal vibrational energy redistribution ) from totally symmetric to non-totally symmetric modes must control the dynamics of ultrafast decay in short all-trans polyenes. The salient features of the reaction path are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 (a) Motion out of the S2 FC region and the subsequent relaxation along the S1 energy surface lies within the space of totally symmetric deformations of the trans-HT molecular backbone. (b) The triggering of fast S1 \xe2\x86\x92 S0 radiationless decay requires a non-totally symmetric deformation of the molecular backbone along a nearly barrierless (\xc2\xb12 kcal mol-1) path. (c) The molecular structure at the S1 \xe2\x86\x92 S0 decay channel (i.e. at the S1/S0 crossing point) and its subsequent evolution on the relaxation path which develops along the S0 energy surface indicate that reactant back-formation must be the favored process.

"The photophysics (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)diphenylphosphine oxide (1) and bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4,4-trimethylpentylphosphine oxide (4) have been investigated by fluorescence, phosphorescence, and low temperature time resolved electron spin resonance. Both 1 and 4 undergo \xce\xb1-cleavage to produce benzoyl and phosphorous centered radicals. The photochemistry of 1 and 4 has been investigated by nanosecond laser flash photolysis, picosecond pump-probe spectroscopy, and steady-state photolysis. The singlet states of 1 and 4 and the phosphorous centered radicals produced by \xce\xb1-cleavage were characterized directly by time resolved absorption spectroscopy. The triplet states of 1 and 4 were characterized indirectly by quenching with 1-phenylnaphthalene as a selective triplet quencher. The use of 1-phenylnaphthalene indicates that \xce\xb1-cleavage occurs mainly from the triplet states of 1 and 4. However, the observed rate of formation of phosphorous centered radicals derived from picosecond investigations is experimentally indistinguishable from the rate of disappearance of the singlet states of 1 and 4. The results are compatible with mechanisms for which the rate of intersystem crossing of the S1 states of 1 and 4 limits the observed rate of \xce\xb1-cleavage, because the rate of \xce\xb1-cleavage is of the same order or faster than the rate of intersystem crossing. This relatively uncommon situation appears to have an analogy in the well investigated photochemistry of dibenzyl ketone. "
"The charge density distribution in crystals of the 1,2-dichloro hydrogen maleate salt formed by 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene (DMAN) has been obtained by high-resolution X-ray and neutron diffraction at 100 K. The asymmetric [Me2N\xe2\x88\x92H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7NMe2]+ hydrogen bond in the monoprotonated cation is characterized by nonlinear interaction lines, constrained by crystallographic symmetry to lie in the plane of the DMAN molecule; the critical point situated between the proton and the acceptor nitrogen atom lies in a region of positive Laplacian of the charge density. The lone pair of this nitrogen atom is polarized in the direction of the hydrogen bond. The N\xe2\x88\x92C(aromatic) bond paths are slightly curved. Magnitudes of the charge density at critical points in covalent and hydrogen bonds within both ions are compared with values obtained from an ab initio MO single point calculation for a cation\xe2\x88\x92anion pair. Properties of the charge density in a number of weak C\xe2\x88\x92H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O interionic interactions are found to be systematically related to the donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor separation. A series of ab initio calculations on a model formate ion\xe2\x88\x92benzene complex shows that the density at C\xe2\x88\x92H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O hydrogen bond critical points is systematically lower than the density of the superposed moieties, but by an amount that is on the threshold of current experimental measurements analyzed with multipole-based models.

"Attachment of four oligomeric (MW 550) ethylene glycol chains to tetraphenylporphyrin results in a highly viscous, room temperature melta hybrid redox polyetherthat is highly concentrated in porphyrin sites (\xe2\x88\xbc0.4 M) and will dissolve LiClO4 electrolyte. Microelectrode voltammetry in undiluted, free base and Co and Fe-metalated melts yields apparent diffusion coefficients that for 1.2 M LiClO4 electrolyte vary by >103-fold, from a high of 6.2 \xc3\x97 10-9 cm2 s-1 for the ring reduction of the free base to a low of ca. 3 \xc3\x97 10-12 cm2 s-1 for the Co(II/III) oxidation in a Co-metalated melt. Taking the latter as measuring the true physical self-diffusivity of the porphyrins, electron self-exchange rate constants are found for four porphyrinic redox couples (free base (0/1\xe2\x88\x92), Co(II/I), Fe(II/I), and Fe(III/II) give 3.6 \xc3\x97 106, 1.2 \xc3\x97 105, 3.7 \xc3\x97 104, and 1.1 \xc3\x97 104 M-1 s-1, respectively). An activation study yields large free energy activation barriers for these couples, and exponential pre-factors in the 1013\xe2\x88\x921014 s-1 range. The polyether appendages provide a weakly coordinating \xe2\x80\x9csolvent\xe2\x80\x9d for the porphyrin centers, and the introduction of ligands like pyridine and carbon monoxide at the gas/melt interface causes changes in Fe(III/II) voltammetry consistent with axial coordination in the semisolid melt. The axial coordination and voltammetric change is reversed by removing the ligand from the bathing gas. "
"Complexes of mixed boron halides BFxCl3-x (x = 1, 2) with CH3F have been detected in solutions in liquid argon (86\xe2\x88\x92115 K), using infrared spectroscopy. The spectra of the complexes have been interpreted by using ab initio calculations at the MP2/6-31+G** level, and indicate the presence of a conformational equilibrium for both boron halides. For CH3F\xc2\xb7BF2Cl the conformationally averaged \xce\x94H\xc2\xb0 was measured to be \xe2\x88\x9212.4(3) kJ mol-1, while for CH3F\xc2\xb7BFCl2 it was found to be \xe2\x88\x9210.8(6) kJ mol-1 for the C1 conformer, and \xe2\x88\x928.6(6) kJ mol-1 for the Cs conformer. For solutions containing BCl3, even at the highest concentrations, no adducts with CH3F were detected. Combined with existing data on CH3F\xc2\xb7BF3, these results show that for weakly bound complexes the Lewis acidity of the boron halides contradicts the established order. This is attributed to the electrostatic nature of the van der Waals bond. "
"The lowest excited singlet states of the structurally rigid amines 1-azaadamantane and 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane have been investigated by using fluorescence excitation spectroscopy on samples seeded in supersonic expansions. Based upon the notion that in both species the lowest excited singlet state is a Rydberg state with the ground state of the radical cation as its ionic core, excitation spectra have been analyzed by employing density functional calculations of the equilibrium geometries and force fields of the ground state of the neutral species and its radical cation. A good agreement is obtained between experimentally observed and theoretically predicted frequencies and intensities of vibronic transitions. Subsequent refinements of the geometry of the lowest excited singlet state are shown to account adequately for the minor differences between experiment and the computational results obtained by using the radical cation as a model for the lowest excited singlet state. From our analysis it also becomes apparent that the excited state is in both molecules subject to vibronic coupling with higher-lying excited states, as exemplified by the presence of transitions to non-totally symmetric vibrational levels. The results of the present study enable the determination of mode-specific reorganization energies accompanying ionization of 1-azaadamantane, which are shown to correspond qualitatively well with those determined in resonance Raman studies on the charge transfer transition in the electron donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor system 1, which contains 1-azaadamantane as the electron donor unit.

"Mechanistic and structural studies show the high enantioenrichments in the products from lithiation\xe2\x88\x92substitutions of N-Boc-N-(p-methoxyphenyl)benzylamine (1) by n-BuLi/(\xe2\x88\x92)-sparteine (6) arise from an enantioselective deprotonation of 1 to provide configurationally stable (R)-2/6. NMR spectroscopy establishes that 13C, 6Li labeled (R)-2/6 and (S)-2/6 are monomeric with lithium complexed to the benzylic position, the carbonyl of the Boc group and (\xe2\x88\x92)-sparteine. Deprotonations of the tertiary protons in (R)- and (S)-N-Boc-N-(p-methoxyphenyl)-\xce\xb1-methylbenzylamine ((R)-8 and (S)-8) with n-BuLi/TMEDA provide (R)-9/TMEDA and (S)-9/TMEDA, respectively, with high enantioenrichments. Absolute configurations assigned to (R)-2 and (R)-1-d1 allow analysis of the electrophile dependent stereochemistry of the reactions of these configurationally stable organolithium intermediates. "
"We present free energy calculations on the Michaelis complexes of the catalytic antibody 17E8 with two substrates, which differ only in their side chains. Replacing a -CH2- group with a -S- increases KM by a factor of about 5\xe2\x88\x928. This corresponds to a free energy \xe2\x80\x9cpreference\xe2\x80\x9d for the -CH2- ligand of about 0.9\xe2\x88\x921.3 kcal/mol. The calculations semiquantitatively reproduce the experimental free energies and show that the preference for a -CH2- over a -S- is mainly due to the more favorable solvation free energy in the unbound form of the molecule.

"A simple two-step synthetic strategy provides a straightforward entry to a large variety of adamantane-containing serine-based cyclodepsipeptides. The design is flexible with respect to the choice of an amino acid, the ring size, and the nature of the template as illustrated here with the preparation of a large variety of serine-based macrocycles, for example, 18-membered simple cyclo(Adm-Ser-)2 (4), 21-membered, S\xe2\x88\x92S bridged, cyclo(Adm-Ser-Cyst-Ser-) (10), 24-membered cyclo(Adm-Ser-Val-)2 (5a), cyclo(Adm-Ser-Leu-)2 (5b), cyclo(Adm-Ser (Leu)-Val)2 (6), pyridine-containing cyclo(Adm-Ser-Val-Py-Val-Ser-) (13), 26-membered cyclo(Adm-Ser-Ser-)2 (8) and crown ether hybrid cyclo(Adm-Ser-TEG-Ser-) (12), and 36-membered cyclo(Adm-Ser-)4 (7) and provides built-in handles (in the form of protected NH2 and COOH groups) for attachment of suitable pendants leading to attractive models that may have multiple uses as membrane ionophores, scaffolds, or templates in the design of artificial proteins and for studying the structure\xe2\x88\x92function relationship in biological receptors. This novel class of macrocyclic peptides are demonstrated to adopt \xce\xb2-turn type conformation and possess high efficiency in transporting Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions across model membranes. Amongst the cyclodepsipeptides reported here, the 24-membered macrocycle 6, containing two leucine residues symmetrically placed on the exterior of the ring, was found to be the most efficient ion-transporter in lipid bilayer membranes. Interestingly, no appreciable ion-transport was noticed by 18-membered cyclodepsipeptide (4) and by macrocycles 10, 12, and 13 possessing only one adamantane unit in their cyclic framework. These results show that a minimum of two adamantane units in a 24-membered ring size appears to be the optimum requirement for efficient membrane ion transport. "
"Fluorescence upconversion measurements of hypericin and its methylated analog, O-hexamethoxyhypericin, which possesses no labile protons, confirm excited-state proton (or hydrogen atom) transfer as the primary photophysical event in hypericin. The presence of a rising component in the time-resolved fluorescence of hypericin and the absence of such a component for the hexamethoxy analog are consistent with our assignment of excited-state proton or atom transfer as the primary photophysical process in the light-activated antiviral compound, hypericin. The results using the fluorescence upconversion technique, which detects only emission from the excited state, are in good agreement with our previous transient absorbance measurements. The results are also consistent with a heterogeneous ground state of hypericin. "
"We have described a series of tethered oligonucleotide probes (triplex TOPs) that recognize one single-stranded and one double-stranded region of an RNA simultaneously through the formation of Watson\xe2\x88\x92Crick and Hoogsteen base pairs, respectively. Here we describe studies on the kinetics and mechanism of triplex TOP\xc2\xb7RREAU association and dissociation. Because triplex TOP\xc2\xb7RREAU complexes cannot be observed by direct electrophoretic methods, kinetics was monitored by use of a competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay that quantified the effect of a triplex TOP on the association and dissociation rates of an electrophoretically stable TOP\xc2\xb7RREAU complex. Association and dissociation rate constants of triplex TOP\xc2\xb7RREAU complexes were extracted from the experimental data by numerical integration. Triplex TOP\xc2\xb7RREAU association reactions at 25 \xc2\xb0C were characterized by rate constants between (7.8 \xc2\xb1 2.0) \xc3\x97 103 and (16 \xc2\xb1 3) \xc3\x97 103 M-1 s-1, while dissociation reactions were characterized by rate constants between (3.3 \xc2\xb1 1.0) \xc3\x97 10-4 and (5.4 \xc2\xb1 2.0) \xc3\x97 10-2 s-1. Rate constants for association of triplex TOP\xc2\xb7RREAU complexes were insensitive to the length and sequence of the 3\xe2\x80\x98-oligonucleotide that mediates triple helix formation. Rate constants for dissociation of triplex TOP\xc2\xb7RREAU complexes were sensitive to changes in tether length as well as the length and composition of the 3\xe2\x80\x98-oligonucleotide. Taken together, these data suggest that triplex TOPs follow a kinetic pathway for binding RREAU in which duplex formation is rate-limiting and precedes triple helix formation. The implication of our data with regard to the kinetics of triple helix association within the context of a highly structured RNA is discussed. "
"Reported here for the first time are the generation of monocarbonyliodonium ylides and their alkylidene-transfer reactions to aldehydes yielding \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-epoxy ketones. Exposure of (Z)-(2-acetoxy-1-decenyl)iodonium bromide, prepared stereoselectively by sodium acetate-catalyzed Michael addition of acetic acid to (1-decynyl)(phenyl)iodonium salt, to EtOLi in THF at \xe2\x88\x9278 \xc2\xb0C results in ester exchange to generate the monocarbonyliodonium ylide with the liberation of ethyl acetate. 1H NMR measurements indicate that the ylide is stable up to \xe2\x88\x9230 \xc2\xb0C in THF-d8 but gradually decomposes at \xe2\x88\x9220 \xc2\xb0C to 1-bromo-2-decanone. The monocarbonyliodonium ylide acts as an alkylidene-transfer agent to carbonyl compounds, and the reaction with aldehydes in THF\xe2\x88\x92DMSO at \xe2\x88\x9230 \xc2\xb0C gives \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-epoxy ketones with E-isomers as a major product. With an \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated aldehyde, selective 1,2-addition to the carbonyl group was observed. The relative rates of the alkylidene-transfer reaction of this ylide for a series of ring-substituted benzaldehydes were measured. A Hammett correlation plot with the \xcf\x83 constants of substituents afforded the reaction constant \xcf\x81 = 2.95 (r = 1.00), which indicates that the monocarbonyliodonium ylide is moderately nucleophilic in nature.

"On photolysis of 2H-phenylazirines in acetonitrile or alcohol solution with 248 nm laser light, phenylnitrile ylides are formed by heterolytic cleavage of the C\xe2\x88\x92C bond of the azirines. The absorption spectra of the ylides are characterized by two strong bands, at ca. 240 and 280 nm, and a weak band, at 380 nm. Electron-deficient olefins react with the nitrile ylides by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to yield 5-membered N-heterocycles (rate constants between 4 \xc3\x97 105 and 7 \xc3\x97 109 M-1 s-1, the Hammett-\xcf\x81 value for the para-substituent on the phenyl ring is \xe2\x88\x920.9). In alcohols as solvents, the nitrile ylides are protonated to yield azaallenium cations, whose spectroscopic properties and reactivities with nucleophiles are described. The protonation rates of the ylides in alcohols increase with the acidity of the alcohol. On the basis of the large kinetic isotope effect for protonation of ylide by alcohol (kH/kD = 5.5), the transition state for the ylide protonation is concluded to be linear. "
"Six nanoscale molecular squares are reported. They are prepared in essentially quantitative yields via spontaneous self-assembly of preprogrammed 90\xc2\xb0 angular units with diverse bimetallic linear linkers. Characterization was accomplished with multinuclear NMR and, in two cases, via ESI-FTICR mass spectral data. The size of these novel metallomacrocycles range from 3.6 nm (diagonal) and 2.6 nm (side) for the smallest to 4.7 nm (diagonal) and 3.4 nm (side) for the largest as estimated by extensible systematic force field calculations. The molecular squares incorporating alkynyl units as corners are able to complex four Ag+ ions via the \xcf\x80-tweezer effect. "
"The violet color of Pt(bpy)(bdt) (bpy = 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine; bdt = 1,2-benzenedithiolate) is due to a Pt/S \xe2\x86\x92 diimine charge-transfer transition; the emission originates from the corresponding triplet state (\xcf\x84 = 460 ns). Photochemical oxidation of Pt(bpy)(bdt) occurs in the presence of oxygen in N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, or dimethyl sulfoxide solution; the reaction has been investigated by 1H NMR and UV\xe2\x88\x92visible absorption spectroscopy. Singlet oxygen produced by energy transfer from the excited complex is implicated as the active oxygen species, in sequential formation of sulfinate, Pt(bpy)(bdtO2), and disulfinate, Pt(bpy)(bdtO4), products. Both products have been characterized by X-ray crystallography. The rate of photooxygenation is strongly dependent on water concentration, and transient absorption spectra are consistent with the formation of at least one intermediate. As a whole, our data suggest that the photooxidation chemistry of platinum(II) diimine dithiolates is similar to that of organic sulfides. "
"Intramolecular electron relays operating in a multicentered enzyme are revealed by protein film voltammetry. The membrane-extrinsic catalytic domain of E. coli fumarate reductase (FrdAB) adsorbs to electroactive monolayer coverage at a rotating pyrolytic graphite edge electrode, giving characteristic voltammetric signals that are resolved and assigned to redox-active sites. At pH 7.3 (2 \xc2\xb0C), signals attributable to Centers 1 ([2Fe-2S]) and 3 ([3Fe-4S]) and FAD are enveloped together around \xe2\x88\x9250 mV, while Center 2 ([4Fe-4S]) appears as a weaker signal at \xe2\x88\x92305 mV. At pH 9.5, similar voltammetry is observed, the main difference being that the FAD component shifts to the negative edge of the envelope. The prominence of the two-electron FAD signal enables active-site redox transformations to be tracked and examined over a range of conditions. Scans at rates up to 20 V s-1 in the absence of fumarate show that electrons are relayed to the FAD, most obviously by Centers 1 and 3. Upon adding fumarate, the signals undergo transformations as specific centers engage in catalytic electron transport. A sigmoidal wave originating in the FAD envelope region is joined by a second wave close to the potential of Center 2. This is particularly evident under conditions optimizing enzyme catalytic control (as opposed to mass-transport control), i.e. high fumarate levels, high rotation rate, and pH 9.0 at which the enzyme is less active than at pH 7.0. Intramolecular electron transport is partitioned between different relay systems depending on catalytic demand and proficiency of the FAD as electron acceptor. At high pH, the less favorable driving force for electron transfer from Centers 1 and 3 places a greater burden on Center 2. Catalytic voltammograms show hysteresis in the presence of oxalacetate, an inhibitor binding preferentially to oxidized FAD. Reductive activation is slow but accelerates sharply below the potential of Center 2, showing that this cluster is much more effective than the others in reducing the inhibitor-bound active site. The results demonstrate how voltammetry can be used to quantify intramolecular electron transfer among multiple sites in complex enzymes. "
Aluminum surface-bound alkoxyzirconium complexes undergo smooth ligand metathesis reactions with a variety of phenols to give the corresponding surface-bound phenoxyzirconium complex species. This process enables rapid preparation of members of a family of surface-bound complexes which are synthesized in situ from an easy-to-prepare common precursor. Ligand metathesis can be monitored by infrared spectroscopy under ambient conditions or by a combination of infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic techniques in ultrahigh vacuum. 
"In an effort to prepare selective and efficient catalysts for ester and amide hydrolysis, we are designing systems that position a coordinated metal ion within a defined protein cavity. Here, the preparation of a protein-1,10-phenanthroline conjugate and the hydrolytic chemistry catalyzed by this construct are described. Iodoacetamido-1,10-phenanthroline was used to modify a unique cysteine residue in ALBP (adipocyte lipid binding protein) to produce the conjugate ALBP-Phen. The resulting material was characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry, UV/vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, gel filtration chromatography, and thiol titration. The stability of ALBP-Phen was evaluated by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation experiments, and the ability of the conjugate to bind Cu(II) was demonstrated by fluorescence spectroscopy. ALBP-Phen-Cu(II) catalyzes the enantioselective hydrolysis of several unactivated amino acid esters under mild conditions (pH 6.1, 25 \xc2\xb0C) at rates 32\xe2\x88\x92280-fold above the background rate in buffered aqueous solution. In 24 h incubations 0.70 to 7.6 turnovers were observed with enantiomeric excesses ranging from 31% ee to 86% ee. ALBP-Phen-Cu(II) also promotes the hydrolysis of an aryl amide substrate under more vigorous conditions (pH 6.1, 37 \xc2\xb0C) at a rate 1.6 \xc3\x97 104-fold above the background rate. The kinetics of this amide hydrolysis reaction fit the Michaelis\xe2\x88\x92Menten relationship characteristic of enzymatic processes. The rate enhancements for ester and amide hydrolysis reported here are 102\xe2\x88\x92103 lower than those observed for free Cu(II) but comparable to those previously reported for Cu(II) complexes.

"A novel method was developed to prepare shell-cross-linked knedel-like structures (SCK\'s), which are double-layered polymer nanospheres, in a convenient three-step procedure:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) polystyrene-b-poly(acrylic acid) ((DPn)PS = 130, (DPn)PAA = 120) copolymer was prepared by sequential anionic polymerization of styrene and tert-butyl acrylate, followed by hydrolysis; (2) the amphiphilic block copolymer was allowed to self-assemble into spherical multimolecular micelles in a water and THF solvent mixture; (3) the poly(acrylic acid), comprising the shells of micelles, was cross-linked by amidation using several di- and multiamino linkers (2,2\xe2\x80\x98-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine), hexakis(ethylene glycol)diamine, hexamethylenediamine, and triethylenetetramine). The extent of cross-linking was controlled by the relative amount of cross-link reagent used. The SCK\'s were spherical, core\xe2\x88\x92shell structures composed of polystyrene cores and cross-linked hydrogel-like shells. The sizes, shapes, and structural differences between the polymer micelles and the SCK\'s were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) in aqueous solution. The non-cross-linked polymer micelles deformed substantially upon adsorption onto mica and became ellipsoidal upon drying on a carbon surface, whereas the SCK\'s remained as stable, spherical structures under all conditions. The polymer micelles had a number average height of 17 nm from AFM and 26 nm diameter from TEM, while the SCK\'s prepared from 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) cross-linkers had a number average height of 24 nm from AFM and a number average diameter of 28 nm from TEM. The SCK shell thickness swelled 2\xe2\x88\x923-fold in water, as determined from comparison of the number average diameter obtained by DLS (37 nm) with that by TEM. Spectroscopic methods and thermal analysis were utilized to further characterize the SCK\'s. "
"Tetrakis(aminophenyl)porphyrin with four bixin side chains in statistical orientation with respect to the porphyrin plane and its zinc(II) complex produced stable colloidal solutions in water at pH 9. Cryoelectron microscopy showed spherical unilamellar vesicles with diameters ranging from 30 to 120 nm and a membrane thickness of 4.7 \xc2\xb1 0.5 nm, corresponding to a monomolecular layer with the bixin side chains tilted by 30\xc2\xb0. The stiff vesicle membranes were not sensitive to the addition of sodium chloride and survived adsorption to dry solid surfaces. Furthermore, the vesicles were totally polymerized by visible light. These polymer vesicles remained intact in 95% ethanol, and scanning force microscopy (SFM) images showed perfectly spherical shapes on graphite. A slow collapse is only observed on hydrated mica. The tetrabixinporphyrin also produced stable monolayers on water surface which polymerized upon irradiation. Combination of the polyene vesicle with an electron-accepting porphyrin, namely a synthetic guanidinium porphyrin or 2-anthraquinone sulfonate, led to light-induced long-lived charge separations. "
"Tetrabutylammonium ion (1) forms tight ion pairs with small anions (Cl-, BH4-) in CDCl3 solution. These ion pairs aggregate as a response to increasing solution concentration with little temperature dependence. Maximum aggregate size is approximately four ion pairs, as measured by comparing self-diffusion coefficients of the aggregates with that of an internal nonaggregating standard of the same shape and nominal size, tetrabutylsilane (2). The magnitudes of steady state interionic 1H{1H} NOEs observed between 1 and the BH4- anion in CDCl3 as a function of temperature in solutions of fixed concentration are well fit to the standard theoretical expression by assuming a single aggregate size that is independent of temperature. A simplified model-free analysis was applied to steady state 15N{1H} NOE and 15N T1 measured at several magnetic field strengths, using 15N-labeled 1 to obtain estimates for reorientational correlation times for the ion aggregates. A similar analysis of 13C{1H} NOE and 13C T1 gives local effective correlation times for C\xe2\x88\x92H bond vectors of the 1-CH2 carbon of 1 and order parameters relating the local motion to overall cation motion. Comparison of these correlation times with those obtained from analysis of 29Si{1H} NOE, 13C{1H} NOE, and 13C T1 for silane 2 provides an estimate of aggregate size which is independent of that obtained by diffusion, with good agreement between the different approaches.

"Polyarylmethyl high-spin polyradicals are designed to possess a structure corresponding to simple spin clusters, where component spins (S\xe2\x80\x98) arise from strong ferromagnetic coupling through 1,3-phenylene units and weak ferromagnetic spin coupling between the component spins is mediated via 3,4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenylene (or 3,5,4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenylyne) units. This rational design permits not only modular and highly convergent synthesis of very high-spin molecules but also detailed analysis of their magnetic data. A series of polyether precursors for the corresponding polyarylmethyl tri-, penta-, hepta-, and hexadecaradicals are prepared. The polyradicals are generated and characterized in frozen tetrahydrofuran (or tetrahydrofuran-d8) solutions, using bulk magnetization studies. The measured values of S, from fits of magnetization vs magnetic field data to Brillouin functions at low temperatures, indicate high-spin ground states; e.g., S = 7.2 vs theoretical S = 8 for hexadecaradical. Estimated yields per site for generation of \xe2\x80\x9cunpaired\xe2\x80\x9d electrons are as high as 98% for the best samples of penta-, hepta-, and hexadecaradicals. The magnetization vs temperature data are fit to the Boltzman distribution of energy levels, obtained from Heisenberg Hamiltonian; the fits produced ferromagnetic coupling constants (J/k) through 3,4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenylene units. For tri- and pentaradical, for which exact analytical solutions to the Heisenberg Hamiltonian can be obtained by the vector model, values of J/k \xe2\x89\x88 90 K are obtained. Hepta- and hexadecaradical, which could not be exactly solved by the vector model, are approximated as a dimer of the S\xe2\x80\x98 = 5/2 and 1 component spins and a trimer of the S\xe2\x80\x98 = 5/2, 3 and 5/2 component spins, respectively; the corresponding values of J/k, 13 and 4 K, are found to be scaled by the fraction of component spin directly connected through the weak spin coupler (3,4\xe2\x80\x98-biphenylene unit).

"The active site of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) has been modeled with both ab initio (MP2/6-31G(d)) and DFT (BH&HLYP/6-311G(d,p)) calculations. The results clearly point out the role of zwitterionic transition structures and the importance of hydrogen bonding interactions in enzymatic decarboxylation. A comparison between the gas-phase decarboxylation of aminoformylacetic acid (H(CO)CH(NH2)COOH) and the corresponding process in solution according to the supermolecule model approach with six water molecules is provided. This study analyzes the role of the proton distribution in lowering the reaction barrier in an intermediate Schiff base (H2CNCH2COOH) and its transition structure for decarboxylation (\xce\x94E\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 29.8 kcal mol-1 at the MP2/6-31G(d) level of theory). Electronic features displayed by the intermediate imine are analyzed by making use of models of increased complexity. The iminium ion functionality has been established to be the dominant factor in lowering the barrier for the decarboxylation of the \xce\xb1-amino acids through Coulombic stabilization of the developing negative charge on the \xce\xb1-carbon and delocalization of the positive charge induced by proton transfer to the imine nitrogen along the reaction coordinate. Further extension of the model imine by an amide group (H2N(CO)CHNCH2COOH) lowers the barrier height by an additional 6.7 kcal mol-1. A net transfer of electron density to the amide functionality in the transition state is not in evidence. The stabilizing influence on the barrier height of a hydrogen bonding network with formic acid and a model peptide residue (H(CO)NHCH2CHO) is estimated to be 3.1 kcal mol-1 at the BH&HLYP/6-311G(d,p) level.

"To exploit the enzymatic method for the synthesis of \xce\xb2-hydroxy-\xce\xb1-amino acids, the genes coding for the Escherichia coli l-threonine aldolase (LTA; EC 2.1.2.1) and Xanthomonus oryzae d-threonine aldolase (DTA) were cloned and overexpressed in E. coli through primer-directed polymerase chain reactions. The purified recombinant enzymes were studied with respect to kinetics, specificity, stability, additive requirement, temperature profile, and pH dependency. DTA requires magnesium ion as a cofactor, while LTA needs no metal ions. These enzymes work well in the presence of DMSO with concentration up to 40%, and DMSO-induced rate acceleration of LTA-catalyzed reaction was observed. Both enzymes use pyridoxal phosphate coenzyme to activate glycine to react with a wide range of aldehydes. LTA gave erythro-\xce\xb2-hydroxy-\xce\xb1-l-amino acids with aliphatic aldehydes and the threo isomer with aromatic aldehydes as kinetically controlled products. On the other hand, DTA formed threo-\xce\xb2-hydroxy-\xce\xb1-d-amino acids as kinetically controlled products with aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes but the diastereoselectivity was lower than that of LTA. Under optimal conditions, several \xce\xb2-hydroxy-\xce\xb1-amino acid derivatives (3-hydroxyleucines, \xce\xb3-benzyloxythreonines, \xce\xb3-benzyloxymethylthreonines, and polyoxamic acids) have been stereoselectively synthesized on preparative scales using these enzymes. Also, the tandem use of DTA and phosphatases has made possible the synthesis and separation of d-allo-threonine phosphate and d-threonine. "
"This paper describes a high-yield, one-step synthesis of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro sugars and their glycosides from glycals using the available electrophilic fluorination reagent 1-chloromethyl-4-fluoro-1,4-diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bis(tetrafluoroborate) (Selectfluor) in the presence of a nucleophile. The method was further expanded to the synthesis of glycosyl fluorides and glycosides from anomeric hydroxy or thioglycoside derivatives. "
"Apo-glucose oxidase is reconstituted with the semisynthetic nitrospiropyran-FAD cofactor to yield a photoisomerizable glucose oxidase, 3a-GOx. The nitrospiropyran-FAD-reconstituted GOx, 3a-GOx, undergoes reversible photoisomerization to the protonated nitromerocyanine-FAD GOx, 3b-GOx. The photoisomerizable enzyme was assembled as a monolayer on a Au electrode. The bioelectrocatalyzed oxidation of glucose in the presence of ferrocenecarboxylic acid (4), ferrocene-1,1\xe2\x80\x98-dicarboxylic acid (5), or 1-[1-(dimethylamino)ethyl]ferrocene (6), acting as electron mediators, was examined in the different photoisomer states of the enzyme. With 4 and 5 acting as electron mediators, the enzyme in state 3b-GOx exhibited bioelectrocatalytic activities for the oxidation of glucose. The bioelectrocatalytic functions of the enzyme in state 3a-GOx were blocked in the presence of 4 or 5. With 6 acting as electron mediator, the enzyme in state 3a-GOx exhibits bioelectrocatalytic activities for the oxidation of glucose, whereas the bioelectrocatalytic functions of the 3b-GOx state are blocked. The directionality of the enzyme photoswitch is controlled by the affinities of the oxidized electron mediators to diffusionally penetrate the protein and reach appropriate electron transfer distances to oxidize the FADH2 redox center of the enzyme. In all of the systems, cyclic amperometric transduction of optical signals recorded by the photoisomerizable enzyme is accomplished. The enzyme photoisomer \xe2\x80\x9con\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9coff\xe2\x80\x9d switching direction is controlled by tuning the electrical interactions of the electron mediator and the photoisomerizable enzyme.

"A facile phosphoramidite method using a tetrazole promoter in a catalytic manner has been developed for the condensation of a nucleoside 3\xe2\x80\x98-phosphoramidite and a nucleoside. This method is particularly useful for a large-scale synthesis of short oligonucleotides. For example, dinucleoside phosphates are prepared on a multigram scale in 92\xe2\x88\x9299% yields through the reaction of nucleoside 3\xe2\x80\x98-N,N-diethylphosphoramidites (1.05 equiv) and 5\xe2\x80\x98-O-free nucleosides (1.00 equiv) with 5-(p-nitrophenyl)-1H-tetrazole (NPT) (0.05 equiv) in the presence of molecular sieves 13X in acetonitrile (40 \xc2\xb0C, 60 min) followed by trimethylsilyl triflate-catalyzed oxidation with bis(trimethylsilyl) peroxide in dichloromethane (40 \xc2\xb0C, 10 min). The NPT-catalytic approach is also effective for the synthesis of longer deoxyribonucleotides such as d(5\xe2\x80\x98CTACCTGT3\xe2\x80\x98) and 2\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x925\xe2\x80\x98- or 3\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x925\xe2\x80\x98-linked ribonucleotides.

"Near-UV or visible light irradiation of Ru(tap)2(bpy)2+ (1) (tap = 1,4,5,8-tetraazaphenanthrene; bpy = 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridyl) in the presence of duplex DNA induces the formation of covalent adducts with guanine. The adduct has been isolated from the photomodified DNA as both its nucleotide and nucleobase derivatives by using a combination of enzymatic and acid hydrolytic procedures in conjunction with HPLC. Characterization by electrospray mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy shows that two isomeric covalent adducts are formed in which the exocyclic amino group of a guanine nucleobase is linked to the C2 or C7 position of one of the tap ligands. It is proposed that the products are generated from the reduced ruthenium complex and the guanine radical cation resulting from photoinduced electron transfer between 1 and guanine. "
"In this paper, we describe a novel catalytic enantioselective synthetic route to the bicyclic tetraene ester 3, a key intermediate for the synthesis of the naturally occurring adenosine diphosphate transport inhibitor atractyligenin (2). The success of this route depended on the extension of the oxazaborolidine-catalyzed (CBS) reduction of an achiral \xce\xb2-stannyl-substituted \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-enone (6c) to form a chiral allylic alcohol and further steps to effect simultaneous transfer of chirality, carbocycle formation, and quaternary stereocenter formation, which led to the triene acid 13. The conversion of 13 to 3 was carried out efficiently by a four-step sequence involving iodolactonization, double elimination, and esterification. The combined use of the CBS reduction of appropriate \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-enones and Claisen rearrangement provides an important synthetic avenue to many types of natural products containing quaternary stereocenters embedded in cyclic networks.

PK-74 and PK-176, are new antibiotics with potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

"Despite the number and variety of their biological applications, the mechanisms of action of the photoactive naphthalenic imides have not yet been fully elucidated. In order to provide mechanistic insight, the photochemistry of several N-substituted 1,8-naphthalimides (NI) and 1,4,5,8-naphthaldiimides (NDI) has been studied using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and by laser flash photolysis (\xce\xbbexc = 355 nm). The lowest singlet state (S1) is mainly \xcf\x80\xcf\x80* in nature for NI whereas n\xcf\x80* character predominates for the NDI. This difference exerts a profound effect on subsequent reaction mechanisms:\xe2\x80\x89 upon irradiation, only the NDI molecules can undergo intramolecular \xce\xb3 hydrogen abstraction. In the case of NP-III, a bishydroperoxy NDI derivative, this photoprocess (\xce\xa6 = 0.03) leads to concomitant formation of an oxygen-centered radical (\xce\xb5 = 21\xe2\x80\x89600 M-1 cm-1 at 465 nm in acetonitrile) and release of the hydroxyl radical (\xe2\x80\xa2OH). All the compounds studied produce the triplet state (in acetonitrile, \xce\xb5T \xe2\x89\x88 10\xe2\x80\x89500\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x80\x89500 M-1 cm-1 at 470 nm for NI and 485 nm for NDI). The quantum yield of intersystem crossing was determined to be close to unity except where intramolecular \xce\xb3 hydrogen abstraction was possible (\xce\xa6isc < 0.5). The triplet states were found to efficiently sensitize the formation of singlet oxygen (with S\xce\x94 > 0.8 for NI and > 0.5 for NDI). In the absence of quenchers, the triplet states react with the ground-state of starting material via electron-transfer with a high rate constant [k = (4\xe2\x88\x926) \xc3\x97 109 and 5 \xc3\x97 108 M-1 s-1 for NDI and NI, respectively] to give the radical anion and radical cation of the corresponding naphthalenic derivative. The high reactivity of the triplet states toward electron donors such as DABCO and their low ability for hydrogen abstraction are typical of a \xcf\x80\xcf\x80* configuration. These mechanistic photochemistry results are discussed with regard to the photobiological effects observed for these compounds and show that the actual reaction leading to biological damage will depend on the microenvironment of the naphthalenic molecule.

"The synthesis, characterizations and binding properties of new chiral hemicarcerands (S)-1 and (SS)-2 are described. From diol 5 and enantiomerically pure (S)-(\xe2\x88\x92)-3 in Me2NCOMe\xe2\x88\x92Cs2CO3, (S)-1\xe2\x8a\x99CHCl3 was obtained (79%, guest exchanged during isolation). Treatment of 5 with (SS)-4 in Me2NCOMe\xe2\x88\x92Cs2CO3 produced (SS)-2\xe2\x8a\x99Me2NCOMe (58%). When the chiral bridge of 1 was introduced into 5 in (Me2N)3PO, a solvent too large to enter 5 but which contained large excesses of PhC*HOHMe, PhS*OMe or MeCH2C*HMeCH2OH, the respective diastereomeric ratios of 1\xe2\x8a\x99guest produced were 1:1.5, 1:1.5, and 1:1. When (S)-1\xe2\x8a\x99CHCl3 was heated (115\xe2\x88\x92160 \xc2\xb0C) in the presence of eight different racemic potential guests (neat or in Ph2O), the CHCl3 was replaced as guest to give diastereomeric equilibrated ratios for 1\xe2\x8a\x99guest that ranged from a high of 2.7:1 for BrCH2CH2C*HBrMe to a low of 1:1 for ClCH2C*HClCH3 and Me2CHCH2CH2C*HOHMe. The guests that replace CHCl3 are entering and departing through the chiral portals, which are larger than those which are non-chiral. The diastereomers of 1\xe2\x8a\x99PhS*OMe gave widely differing Rf values (0.41 and 0.27) on thin layer chromatographic plates. Similar introductions of six enantiomeric pairs of guests into the inner phase of 2 gave diastereomeric ratios that ranged between 1.4:1 for 2\xe2\x8a\x99MeC*HOHCH2Me to 1:1 for 2\xe2\x8a\x99PhS*OMe, 2\xe2\x8a\x991,2-propanediol, and 2\xe2\x8a\x992-methyl-1-butanol. The two nonchiral 26-membered ring portals are less encumbering than the two chiral 26-membered ring portals of 2. When a mixture of (S)-1 and Ph2O was heated (25 \xc2\xb0C, 1 d) with racemic 4-MeC6H4S(O)Me, only (S)-1\xe2\x8a\x99(R)-4-MeC6H4S(O)Me was isolated. When (S)-4-MeC6H4S(O)Me was substituted for the racemic sulfoxide, no sulfoxide complex was isolated. The 1H NMR spectra of the guests in diastereomerically related complexes are substantially different from one another. "
"A series of eight symmetrically substituted diketopiperazines (DKPs) derived from 1-amino-1-carboxycycloalkanes (n = 3\xe2\x88\x927; 3,3,5,5-tetramethylcyclohexane; 4,4-dimethylcyclohexane; 2-indan) were synthesized and their crystal structures determined. In the solid state, all eight compounds form two pairs of hydrogen bonds with two adjacent molecules to form a one-dimensional structure that we refer to as \xe2\x80\x9ctapes\xe2\x80\x9d. These molecules represent a range of volumes and shapes that contain a common molecular fragment (DKP ring). We examined this series of compounds with three objectives in mind:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) to establish the ability of the hydrogen-bonded \xe2\x80\x9ctape\xe2\x80\x9d motif to persist through these differences in volume and shape; (ii) to provide a series of structurally related compounds to use to test computational methods of predicting crystal structure from molecular structure; (iii) to search for qualitative correlations between molecular structure and crystal packing. All compounds form tapes and with one exception, all tapes pack with their long axes parallel. When viewed down their long axis, two types of tapes emerge:\xe2\x80\x89 planar and nonplanar. The type of tape that forms reflects the conformation adapted by the DKP ringplanar or boat. Planar tapes form when the angle (\xce\xb1) between the two planes defined by the cis-amides in the DKP ring is 180\xc2\xb0; nonplanar tapes form when \xce\xb1 < 180\xc2\xb0. Five of the eight compounds studied form planar tapes, the remaining three compounds form nonplanar tapes. Despite the variability in volume and shape represented by this series of molecules, the persistence of the tape motif in their crystalline solids suggests that the hydrogen-bonding interactions between DKPs dominate the packing arrangement of these molecules. Void space in the crystalline solid is minimized by parallel alignment of tapes that pack in a manner that permits the interdigitation of substituents on adjacent tapes. "
"The electronic effects of electron withdrawing aryl substituents on equatorial and apical diphosphines were investigated. Chelating diphosphines designed to coordinate in diequatorial or in apical\xe2\x88\x92equatorial positions were synthesized, and their effects on the regioselectivity of rhodium catalyzed 1-hexene hydroformylation were observed. Only diequatorial coordination was observed for 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bis[(diphenylphosphino)methyl]-1,1\xe2\x80\x98-biphenyl (BISBI) complexes (BISBI)Ir(CO)2H (8) and [BISBI-(3,5-CF3)]Ir(CO)2H (10), and only apical\xe2\x88\x92equatorial coordination was seen for 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (DIPHOS) complexes (DIPHOS)Ir(CO)2H (14) and [DIPHOS-(3,5-CF3)]Ir(CO)2H (15). For the trans-1,2-bis[(diphenylphosphino)methyl]cyclopropane (T-BDCP) complexes, a mixture of diequatorial and apical\xe2\x88\x92equatorial complexes was seen. For (T-BDCP)Ir(CO)2H (12), 12-ae was favored over 12-ee by 63:37, but for [T-BDCP-(3,5-CF3)]Ir(CO)2H (13) the conformational preference was reversed and a 10:90 ratio of 13-ae:13-ee was seen. The electron withdrawing groups in the equatorial positions of BISBI-(3,5-CF3) (1) and T-BDCP-(3,5-CF3) (2) led to an increase in n-aldehyde regioselectivity in rhodium catalyzed hydroformylation. However, electron withdrawing aryl substituents in the apical positions of DIPHOS-(3,5-CF3) (3) led to a decrease in n-aldehyde regioselectivity in rhodium catalyzed hydroformylation. "
"A comparison of acidity of two solids, a poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (Amberlyst 15) and a perfluoroinated ion exchange polymer (Nafion-H, PFIEP) with the structurally related liquid acids methanesulfonic, sulfuric, and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA), was conducted with mesityl oxide as probe base (determination of the \xce\x94\xce\xb41 parameter) and for the fluorinated materials also with hexamethylbenzene as the probe base. It was found that Nafion-H is similar in strength to 85% sulfuric acid, whereas Ambelyst 15 is much weaker than 80% methanesulfonic acid or 60% sulfuric acid. Thus, the solids are much weaker acids than their liquid structural analogs. This seems to be a general property, because the rigidity of the solids prevents the acid groups/sites from cooperating in the transfer of a hydron, an essential feature in the manifestation of superacidity. The postulation of superacidity for a number of solid acids appears to have no basis in fact. On the other hand, the acidity of the groups/sites on the surface can be increased by the interaction with a nonbasic solvent, capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds with the anion of the site (anion-stabilizing solvent). The anion-stabilizing solvent generates a new liquid phase around the acid site; for appropriate structures of the solid acid and solvent this phase can be superacidic. The acidity-enhancing effect of the anion-stabilizing solvent was found to have an important effect in boosting the catalytic activity of the solid for carbocationic reactions. "
"Uteroferrin (Uf) is a purple acid phosphatase for which the reduced [FeIIFeIII] form of the enzyme is catalytically active in the hydrolysis of phosphate esters. The binuclear non-heme iron active site of the native reduced enzyme (1/2metUf) and its molybdate- and phosphate-bound forms have been studied with absorption (ABS), circular dichorism (CD), and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopies to probe their geometric and electronic structure. CD and MCD in the UV\xe2\x88\x92Vis region give the tyrosine (phenolate) to FeIII charge transfer bands which probe the ferric center. CD and MCD in the NIR region probe the d\xe2\x88\x92d transitions of both the FeII and the FeIII centers. Variable-temperature variable-field (VTVH) MCD combined with EPR data are analyzed to determine the g values and energies of the ground state and the excited sublevels. These parameters are further interpreted in terms of a spin Hamiltonian model, which includes the zero-field splitting (ZFS) of FeII and FeIII centers and the exchange coupling (J) between the irons due to bridging ligation. These ground and excited-state results confirm that both irons are six-coordinate with a \xce\xbc-OH bridge. Anions bind to the active site in a bridging mode, which perturbs the ground and excited states of both iron centers. In particular, the exchange coupling decreases, \xce\xbc-OH bridge \xe2\x86\x92 FeII bonding strength increases, and the Tyr \xe2\x86\x92 FeIII donor interaction increases upon the phosphate binding. These results are correlated with the recent X-ray crystal structure of the kidney bean purple acid phosphatase, which contains an FeIIIZnII active site. These studies provide geometric and electronic structure insight into the hydrolysis reaction mechanism of this enzyme. "
"The free-base and Zn(II) complexes of N-methyl-\xce\xb2-octaethyl- and meso-tetratolylchlorin and isobacteriochlorin were synthesized and characterized. Direct methylation of free-base hydroporphyrin compounds was unexpectedly selective. Only one of the several possible regioisomers that could result from alkylation of the inequivalent N atoms was produced for each hydroporphyrin free-base. This result was independent of the electrophilic reagent ([MeSPh2][BF4] for meso-tetraaryl compounds and methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate for \xce\xb2-octaethyl compounds) or the peripheral substituents on the hydroporphyrin. However, the greater basicity of the \xce\xb2-octaethyl substituted compounds resulted in their isolation as protonated cations. Methylation occurred at a pyrrole ring rather than a pyrroline ring. In chlorins, the pyrrole ring across the macrocycle from the pyrroline ring was methylated to afford the symmetric N-methyl chlorins H(s-N23-MeTTC) and H2(s-N23-MeOEC)+. The selectivity is a result of kinetic rather than thermodynamic factors. Slow air oxidation of H(N-MeTTiBC) affords the unsymmetric N-methyl chlorin H(u-N22-MeTTC). The bacteriochlorins H2(TTBC) and H2(OEBC) were unreactive toward all electrophilic reagents investigated. An alternative synthetic approach, reduction of H(N-MeTTP), appears to have a selectivity complementary to direct methylation. It afforded a complex mixture of compounds that contained H(u-N22-MeTTC) and one other yet unidentified N-methyl hydroporphyrin. Free-base N-methyl hydroporphyrins react rapidly and quantitatively with zinc salts to afford Zn(II) complexes. The 1H NMR spectra were characterized by N-methyl group resonances that have shifts between 0 and 4 ppm upfield of TMS and decreased ring current effects as the saturation of the macrocycle increases. The inequivalence of the two faces of the macrocycle owing to the N-methyl group revealed that the meso-aryl groups undergo restricted rotational motion. The barriers to rotation vary with saturation and metalation but are substantially smaller than in metallo-TTP compounds. Both the oxidations and reductions of free-base N-methyl hydroporphyrin compounds are markedly irreversible. However, the zinc complexes have reversible reductions. "
"Addition of 1 equiv of polydentate amine or ether donor solvent to hydrocarbon solutions of lithium hexamethydisilazide (LHMDS) yields a variety of complexes with different aggregation states. X-ray crystallographic analyses have been carried out on six new compounds revealing three- and four-coordinate monomers, \xce\xb71-coordinated mono- and disolvated dimers, and polymers of dimers. PM3 calculations were able to locate minima for a variety of possible structures for the ligands N,N,N\xe2\x80\x98,N\xe2\x80\x98-tetramethylethylenediamine and 1,2-dimethoxyethane. However, the heats of formation from these calculations are found to be unreliable in predicting the relative stabilities of the isomers. Single point ab initio calculations at the 6-31G* level on the PM3 optimized structures give energies which correspond well to the known aggregation states of LHMDS species. Deaggregation from dimers to monomers appears to be driven by a combination of steric, electronic, and chelate effects. "
"A series of novel redox-active and photoactive ruthenium(II) and osmium(II) bipyridyl-, ferrocene-, and cobaltocenium-containing macrocyclic receptors with the dual capability of selectively sensing anionic guest species via electrochemical and optical methodologies have been prepared. Single-crystal X-ray structures of 7\xc2\xb7Cl-, 7\xc2\xb72Br-, and 13\xc2\xb72OAc- highlight the importance of hydrogen bonding and respective macrocyclic cavity size to the anion recognition process in the solid state. Proton NMR titration studies in deuterated DMSO solutions reveal these receptors form strong and remarkably selective complexes with Cl-, H2PO4-, and OAc- anions dependent upon the flexibility, topology, and size of the receptor cavity. Cyclic and square-wave voltammetric investigations have demonstrated these receptors to electrochemically recognize Cl-, H2PO4-, and OAc- anions.

"A variety of paramagnetic molybdenum complexes, [N3N]MoR ([N3N]3- = [(Me3SiNCH2CH2)3N]3-; R = Me, Et, Bu, CH2Ph, CH2SiMe3, CH2CMe3, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentenyl, phenyl), have been prepared from [N3N]MoCl. The several that have been examined all follow Curie\xe2\x88\x92Weiss S = 1 behavior with a magnetic moment in the solid state between 2.4 and 2.9 \xce\xbc\xce\x92 down to 50 K. Below \xe2\x88\xbc50 K the effective moments undergo a sharp decrease as a consequence of what are proposed to be a combination of spin\xe2\x88\x92orbit coupling and zero field splitting effects. NMR spectra are temperature dependent as a consequence of \xe2\x80\x9clocking\xe2\x80\x9d of the backbone into one C3-symmetric conformation and as a consequence of Curie\xe2\x88\x92Weiss behavior. The cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl complexes show another type of temperature-dependent fluxional behavior that can be ascribed to a rapid and reversible \xce\xb1-elimination process. For the cyclopentyl complex the rate constant for \xce\xb1-elimination is \xe2\x88\xbc103 s-1 at room temperature, while the rate constant for \xce\xb1-elimination for the cyclohexyl complex is estimated to be \xe2\x88\xbc200 s-1 at room temperature. An isotope effect for \xce\xb1-elimination for the cyclohexyl complex was found to be \xe2\x88\xbc3 at 337 K. Several of the alkyl complexes decompose between 50 and 120 \xc2\xb0C. Of the complexes that contain linear alkyls, only [N3N]Mo(CH2CMe3) decomposes cleanly (but slowly) by \xce\xb1,\xce\xb1-dehydrogenation to give [N3N]Mo\xe2\x8b\xaeCCMe3. [N3N]MoMe is by far the most stable of the alkyl complexes; no [N3N]Mo\xe2\x8b\xaeCH can be detected upon attempted thermolysis at 120 \xc2\xb0C. Other decompositions of linear alkyl complexes are complicated by competing reactions, including \xce\xb2-hydride elimination. \xce\xb2-Hydride elimination (to give [N3N]MoH) is the sole mode of decomposition of the cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl complexes; the former decomposes at a rate calculated to be approximately 10\xc3\x97 that of the latter at 298 K. \xce\xb2-Hydride elimination in [N3N]Mo(cyclopentyl) to give (unobservable) [N3N]Mo(cyclopentene)(H) has been shown to be 6\xe2\x88\x927 orders of magnitude slower than \xce\xb1-hydride elimination to give (unobservable) [N3N]Mo(cyclopentylidene)(H). [N3N]Mo(cyclopropyl) evolves ethylene in a first-order process upon being heated to give [N3N]Mo\xe2\x8b\xaeCH, while [N3N]Mo(cyclobutyl) is converted into [N3N]Mo\xe2\x8b\xaeCCH2CH2CH3. [N3N]MoH decomposes slowly and reversibly at 100 \xc2\xb0C to yield molecular hydrogen and [(Me3SiNCH2CH2)2NCH2CH2SiMe2CH2]Mo ([bitN3N]Mo). X-ray structures of [N3N]Mo(triflate), [N3N]MoMe, [N3N]Mo(cyclohexyl), and [bitN3N]Mo show that the degree of twist of the TMS groups away from an \xe2\x80\x9cupright\xe2\x80\x9d position correlates with the size of the ligand in the apical pocket and that steric congestion in the cyclohexyl complex is significantly greater than in the methyl complex. Relief of steric strain in the ground state in molecules of this general type to give a less crowded alkylidene hydride intermediate is proposed to be an important feature of the high rate of \xce\xb1-elimination relative to \xce\xb2-elimination in several circumstances.

"A series of nine coordination compounds is described, in which a common supramolecular structure, a ribbon of cyanurates, persists across variations in the metal center, coordination geometry, coordination environment, and crystal type. The syntheses and solid-state structures, as determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, are described for six of the complexes, trans-[Cu(cyan-\xce\xbaN)2(H2O)2]\xc2\xb72Na(cyan)\xc2\xb74H2O (1), trans-[Cu(cyan-\xce\xbaN)2(NH3)2] (5), trans-[Cu(cyan-\xce\xbaN)2(NH3)2]trans-[Cu(cyan-\xce\xbaO2)2(NH3)4] (6), trans-[Ni(cyan-\xce\xbaN)2(NH3)4] (7), (OC-6-33)-[Ni(cyan-\xce\xbaN)2(NH3)2(H2O)2] (8), and [Cu(cyan-\xce\xbaN)(PPh3)2]\xc2\xb72CDCl3 (9). The results are discussed together with the previously reported structures of the other three complexes, [M(cyan-\xce\xbaN)(H2O)5](cyan)\xc2\xb72H2O (M = Mn (2), Co (3), Ni (4)). In all cases, the ribbon of cyanurates is propagated through a recognition interaction involving a pair of hydrogen bonds between adjacent cyanurates, with a topological pattern of the type (8). In eight of the nine cases, the ribbon is linear, but for compound 5, which is the first product of the reaction from which compound 6 is derived, the ribbon is crenelled. An unsuccessful attempt to synthesize a product without the cyanurate ribbon in the solid state is described. The possibility that the cyanurate ribbon represents a traditional self-assembly in some of these systems but not in others is discussed. It is concluded that the formation of the cyanurate ribbon is a determinative factor in the solid-state structural coordination chemistry of the cyanurates of metals of the first transition series.

"Three heteroditopic cryptands with different cavity dimensions have been synthesized in high yields at 278 K without employing any templating metal ion. The three secondary amino nitrogens in each cryptand could be derivatized with anthryl groups to have a fluorophore\xe2\x88\x92spacer\xe2\x88\x92receptor configuration. The fluorophores in these systems do not show any fluorescence due to an efficient photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer (PET) from nitrogen lone pairs. However, the fluorescence can be recovered to different extents in the presence of different metal ions and protons as well. On complexation by a transition metal ion or on protonation in a solvent like dry THF, each exhibits large fluorescence enhancement as the nitrogen lone pairs responsible for PET are engaged in bonding. Inner-transition-metal ions like Eu(III) or Tb(III) show remarkable discrimination and give high fluorescence enhancement only in one case where the cavity size is smaller than that of other two. Each system exhibits large fluorescence enhancement with Pb(II) among the heavy metal ions studied. The present study shows that transition metal ions and Pb(II), which are known for quenching, can indeed cause fluorescence enhancement in cryptand-based systems. It is also reported for the first time that inner-transition-metal ions can also cause fluorescence. The enhancement in each case is interpreted in terms of a communication gap between the metal ion and fluorophore. Such cryptand-based fluorophores can be useful as potential molecular photonic devices and metal ion sensors as well. "
"Formation, structure, and properties of alkanethiolate monolayers on micrometrically driven hanging mercury drop electrodes were investigated electrochemically. Alkanethiols with the chain length from C8 to C18 were shown to form densely packed (ca. 20.3 \xc3\x852/molecule for C12SH), perpendicularly oriented monolayers on mercury in a process involving two electron oxidation of Hg to form mercuric thiolate, in agreement with earlier literature reports for a number of thiols. Electron tunneling rates across these films (due to Ru(NH3)63+ electro-reduction in aqueous 0.50 M KCl) exhibit characteristic exponential increase with the electrode potential (with transfer coefficient \xce\xb1 = 0.25), and an exponential decay with the monolayer thickness (with a through-bond decay constant, \xce\xb2tb = 1.14 per methylene group or 0.91 \xc3\x85-1). Slow stepwise expansion of the mercury drop electrodes coated with alkanethiolates (C9\xe2\x88\x92C14 only) results in an only small increase of the tunneling current maintaining the pin-hole free structure of the monolayers. Capacitance measurements showed that the film thickness changes inversely proportionally with the electrode surface area. The increase of the tunneling current recorded in the drop expansion experiments was accounted for by postulating existence of an additional tunneling pathway involving chain-to-chain coupling. Data analysis in view of this parallel pathways model yielded a through-space decay constant, \xce\xb2ts = 1.31 \xc3\x85-1. Ab initio computations of the electronic coupling matrix element (based on Koopmans\' theorem approximation) and its distance dependence across a number of perpendicularly orientated n-alkanes yielded a decay constant of 1.25 \xc3\x85-1 in excellent agreement with the measurements.

"Electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) from 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) in acetonitrile has been examined following reaction of its radical ions with various donors and acceptors by using high speed potential pulses at a microelectrode. The reaction pathways were identified by examining the reaction orders of the limiting reagents and by comparison of the temporal emission pulses with simulated reaction schemes. For reactions with a free energy value more negative than that required to directly form the excited state singlet (3.06 eV), first-order behavior was observed for DPA radical ions indicating direct singlet formation (S-route). For the remaining systems the reaction order was second order in DPA radical ions, indicative of excited singlet formation via triplet\xe2\x88\x92triplet annihilation (T-route). Despite evidence of triplet quenching by the unreacted radical ions, the efficiency of photon production at high concentrations of DPA by the T-route (0.012) approached that of the S-route, and is much higher than previously reported. For DPA\xe2\x80\xa2+ and naphthyl phenyl ketone a mixed reaction order was found. The free energy of this reaction is deficient by 0.05 eV, and in this case, direct singlet formation is able to compete with the more energetically favorable triplet pathway. The high efficiency experimentally found for the T-route suggests that it may be an alternate scheme to employ in solid-state display devices. "
"A systematic theoretical investigation of tetramethyldiarsane is presented to help understand its structure and photoelectron spectrum. Full potential energy curve along the C\xe2\x88\x92As\xe2\x88\x92As\xe2\x88\x92C torsion was calculated at the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock (HF) level, and complete geometry optimizations were performed at HF, second-order Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT(2)), and Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) levels of theory. Two conformers, anti and gauche, have been found in accordance with the experimental observations. The calculated geometries are in good agreement with the electron diffraction results. Ionization energies were computed by the Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster (EOM-CC) method. The calculations predict a substantial lone-pair splitting for both conformers which contradicts the original assignment of the photoelectron spectrum by Cowley et al. According to the new assignment, the first and third bands belong to the lone pairs of the anti rotamer, the second band is attributed to the n+ lone-pair combination in the gauche conformer, while the peak of the n- combination is merged with the intense first band previously ascribed exclusively to the anti rotamer. The conformer ratios calculated from the present assignment of the photoelectron spectrum are in good agreement with the quantum-chemical results. Since our assignment contradicts the theoretical reasoning, which the original assignment was based on, a new explanation is presented. We find that the s-character of the lone-pair orbitals increases in the order of nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony which explains not only the increasing pyramidalization of the Me2E moiety but also the increasing splitting of the energy of the lone-pair MOs.

"Ab initio calculations at the G2(MP2,SVP) level predict that there is a striking transition from a preference for classical isomers on the C7H7+ surface to a preference for nonclassical isomers on the C6H7Ge+ surface. The situation for C6H7Si+ is intermediate between these extremes, with classical and nonclassical isomers tending to have comparable energies despite their significant geometric differences. "

The method relies on measurement of peak intensities of multiplet components in spectra recording zero- and double-quantum 13C\xce\xb1\xe2\x88\x9213C\xe2\x80\x98 coherences. Results based on two proteins, ubiquitin and CheY, demonstrate a well-defined relation between cross-correlation rate and \xcf\x88. "
"We have investigated the carbon-13 solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts of C\xce\xb1, C\xce\xb2, and C\xce\xb3 carbons of 19 valine residues in a vertebrate calmodulin, a nuclease from Staphylococcus aureus, and a ubiquitin. Using empirical chemical shift surfaces to predict C\xce\xb1, C\xce\xb2 shifts from known, X-ray \xcf\x86,\xcf\x88 values, we find moderate accord between prediction and experiment. Ab initio calculations with coupled Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock (HF) methods and X-ray structures yield poor agreement with experiment. There is an improvement in the ab initio results when the side chain \xcf\x871 torsion angles are adjusted to their lowest energy conformers, using either ab initio quantum chemical or empirical methods, and a further small improvement when the effects of peptide-backbone charge fields are introduced. However, although the theoretical and experimental results are highly correlated (R2 \xe2\x88\xbc 0.90), the observed slopes of \xe2\x88\xbc\xe2\x88\x920.6\xe2\x88\x920.8 are less than the ideal value of \xe2\x88\x921, even when large uniform basis sets are used. Use of density functional theory (DFT) methods improves the quality of the predictions for both C\xce\xb1 (slope = \xe2\x88\x921.1, R2 = 0.91) and C\xce\xb2 (slope = \xe2\x88\x920.93, R2 = 0.89), as well as giving moderately good results for C\xce\xb3. This effect is thought to arise from a small, conformationally-sensitive contribution to shielding arising from electron correlation. Additional shielding calculations on model compounds reveal similar effects. Results for valine residues in interleukin-1\xce\xb2 are less highly correlated, possibly due to larger crystal\xe2\x88\x92solution structural differences. When taken together, these results for 19 valine residues in 3 proteins indicate that choosing the lowest energy \xcf\x871 conformer together with X-ray \xcf\x86,\xcf\x88 values enables the successful prediction of both C\xce\xb1 and C\xce\xb2 shifts, with DFT giving close to ideal slopes and R2 values between theory and experiment. These results strongly suggest that the most highly populated valine side-chain conformers are those having the lowest (computationally determined) energy, as evidenced by the ability to predict essentially all C\xce\xb1, C\xce\xb2 chemical shifts in calmodulin, SNase, and ubiquitin, as well as moderate accord for C\xce\xb3. These observations suggest a role for chemical shifts and energy minimization/geometry optimization in the refinement of protein structures in solution, and potentially in the solid state as well. "
"The carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance shielding surfaces for the isotropic and anisotropic shielding components, \xcf\x8311, \xcf\x8322, and \xcf\x8333, for C\xce\xb1 in N-formylglycine amide, and C\xce\xb1 and C\xce\xb2 in N-formylalanine amide, N-formylvaline amide (\xcf\x871 = 180\xc2\xb0, \xe2\x88\x9260\xc2\xb0, 60\xc2\xb0), N-formylisoleucine amide (all \xcf\x871 = \xe2\x88\x9260\xc2\xb0 conformers), N-formyl serine amide (\xcf\x871 = 74.3\xc2\xb0), and N-formylthreonine amide (\xcf\x871 = 180\xc2\xb0, \xe2\x88\x9260\xc2\xb0, 60\xc2\xb0) have been computed at the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock level by using large, locally dense basis sets. The results for C\xce\xb1 in glycine and alanine show the expected \xe2\x88\xbc4\xe2\x88\x925 ppm increase in isotropic shielding of sheet over helical geometries, and the overall breadths of the shielding tensors are very similar for both helical and sheet fragments (|\xcf\x8333 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x8311| \xe2\x88\xbc 31\xe2\x88\x9237 ppm). However, for each of the C\xce\xb2 substituted amino acids (valine, isoleucine, serine, and threonine) our results for C\xce\xb1 indicate not only the expected \xe2\x88\xbc4\xe2\x88\x925 ppm increase in shielding of sheet fragments over helical ones but also a large increase in the overall tensor breadths for sheet residues over helical ones, and a change in tensor orientation. On average, the sheet residues have |\xcf\x8333 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x8311| \xe2\x88\xbc 34 ppm, while on average the helical value is only \xe2\x88\xbc22 ppm. For each C\xce\xb2 substituted amino acid, the results for C\xce\xb1 also show that |\xcf\x8322 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x8311|(sheet) \xe2\x89\xab |\xcf\x8322 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x8311|(helix). For C\xce\xb2, the helical and sheet tensor breadths are in general much more similar for a given amino acid, although the actual magnitudes vary widely from one amino acid to another. Since the individual C\xce\xb1 tensor elements, \xcf\x8311, \xcf\x8322, and \xcf\x8333, are all quite sensitive to not only the backbone torsion angles, \xcf\x86, \xcf\x88, but also to the side chain torsion angle, \xcf\x871, as well, these results suggest that it will in many instances be possible to deduce both backbone (\xcf\x86,\xcf\x88) and side chain (\xcf\x871) torsion angles from an experimental determination of the three principal elements of the 13C\xce\xb1 shielding tensor, results which can be confirmed in some cases with data on C\xce\xb2 (and C\xce\xb3). Such an approach, based on quantum chemical calculations, should be useful in determining the structures of both crystalline, noncrystalline, and potentially even soluble peptides and proteins, as well as in refining their structures, using shielding tensor elements.

"We have investigated the properties of nucleating lysozyme solutions, at various lysozyme and NaCl concentrations at pH 4.2, by isothermal conduction microcalorimetry and small-angle static light scattering. Both types of experiments were performed under stirring and differ drastically from their counterparts where stirring was not applied. Pronounced heat\xe2\x88\x92power peaks, that can be attributed to nucleation and growth, appear at finite times which in turn depend on the supersaturation level. The calorimetric results are in qualitative accordance with the nucleation behavior deduced from small-angle scattering experiments. The implications of these experiments in the nucleation process of lysozyme are (i) without stirring, large fractal clusters with dimensionalities lower than \xe2\x88\xbc2.00 form and, after 1\xe2\x88\x922 days, large crystals appear and (ii) with stirring, nuclei of several micrometers in size appear within 2\xe2\x88\x9213 h depending on conditions. Their dimensionalities vary between 2.5 and 3.0, indicating dense morphology; their appearance is accompanied by showers of microcrystals. "
"Multiconfigurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) wave functions, augmented by second order perturbation theory to partially recover the dynamic correlation, suggest that the most likely route from silacyclobutane to products ethylene + silene is initial cleavage of a ring CC bond to form a trans \xc2\xb7CH2SiH2CH2CH2\xc2\xb7 diradical, followed by rupture of the central SiC bond. This prediction is in agreement with the available experimental results. While this trans diradical is predicted to be a minimum on the MCSCF ground state potential energy surface, the transition state separating this species from products disappears when dynamic correlation is added. Therefore, the bottleneck on this part of the potential energy surface is likely to be the transition state for the initial CC bond cleavage. The alternative mechanism that is initiated by cleavage of a ring SiC bond leads to an analogous trans \xc2\xb7SiH2CH2CH2CH2\xc2\xb7 diradical. The transition state leading to this species is the highest point on this minimum energy path and is nearly 6 kcal/mol higher in energy than the transition state that leads to the \xc2\xb7CH2SiH2CH2CH2\xc2\xb7 diradical. A transition state for the concerted decomposition has also been found, but this structure is much higher in energy (\xe2\x88\xbc10 kcal/mol) than the highest point on the preferred route. Comparison of the multireference perturbation theory and coupled cluster CCSD(T) results suggests that production of propylsilylene should be both thermodynamically and kinetically competitive with the formation of ethylene + silene. This is consistent with the mechanism proposed by one of us in 1984. "
"The edge-bridged tetrahedral geometry of five-coordinate d0 complexes [MD2L3] with strong \xcf\x80-donors D is analyzed with extended H\xc3\xbcckel methodology as well as density functional theory.

This model was tested with a structure-correlation analysis of all experimentally determined [MD2L3] structures, thus allowing a mapping of the reversed-Berry pathway. The catalytic potential of these complexes and their isolobal relationship to [MCp2L3] are emphasized. "
The first total synthesis of a scopadulan diterpene is described. The key step is a double Heck cyclization of dienyl aryl iodide 8 to form tetracyclic enones 24 and 25 in 80\xe2\x88\x9285% combined yield. 
"The mode of action of a semisynthetic glycopeptide active against vancomycin-resistant bacteria has been investigated. It is shown that the antibiotic, biphenylchloroeremomycin or LY307599, dimerizes strongly and anchors to membranes. It is hypothesized that these two locating devices, previously identified by us when acting separately, might combine to give enhanced binding at a cell surface. This hypothesis is tested experimentally by showing that glycopeptides can bind cell-wall precursor analogues from resistant bacteria (terminating in \xe2\x88\x92d-lactate) in a similar manner to those from susceptible bacteria (terminating in \xe2\x88\x92d-alanine) and by using model cell surfaces where the benefits of dimerization can be expressed and studied. These model systems use vesicles to represent the cell membrane, to which cell wall analogues are anchored via a docosanoyl chain, so mimicking the arrangement encountered at the cell surface. Using 1H NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate enhanced binding due to dimerization and propose that this enhancement will act cooperatively with membrane anchoring in biphenylchloroeremomycin. "
"The peptide Boc-Gly-Dpg-Gly-Gly-Dpg-Gly-NHMe (1) has been synthesized to examine the conformational preferences of Dpg residues in the context of a poor helix promoting sequence. Single crystals of 1 were obtained in the space group P21/c with a = 13.716(2) \xc3\x85, b = 12.960(2) \xc3\x85, c = 22.266(4) \xc3\x85, and \xce\xb2 = 98.05(1)\xc2\xb0; R = 6.3% for 3660 data with |Fo| > 4\xcf\x83. The molecular conformation in crystals revealed that the Gly(1)-Dpg(2) segment adopts \xcf\x86, \xcf\x88 values distorted from those expected for an ideal type II\xe2\x80\x98 \xce\xb2-turn (\xcf\x86Gly(1) = +72.0\xc2\xb0, \xcf\x88Gly(1) = \xe2\x88\x92166.0\xc2\xb0; \xcf\x86Dpg(2) = \xe2\x88\x9254.0\xc2\xb0, \xcf\x88Dpg(2) = \xe2\x88\x9246.0\xc2\xb0) with an inserted water molecule between Boc-CO and Gly(3)NH. The Gly(3)-Gly(4) segment adopts \xcf\x86, \xcf\x88 values which lie broadly in the right handed helical region (\xcf\x86Gly(3) = \xe2\x88\x9278.0\xc2\xb0, \xcf\x88Gly(3) = \xe2\x88\x929.0\xc2\xb0; \xcf\x86Gly(4) = \xe2\x88\x9280.0\xc2\xb0, \xcf\x88Gly(4) = \xe2\x88\x9218.0\xc2\xb0). There is a chiral reversal at Dpg(5) which takes up \xcf\x86, \xcf\x88 values in the left handed helical region. The Dpg(5)-Gly(6) segment closely resembles an ideal type I\xe2\x80\x98 \xce\xb2-turn (\xcf\x86Dpg(5) = +56.0\xc2\xb0, \xcf\x88Dpg(5) = +32.0\xc2\xb0; \xcf\x86Gly(6) = +85.0\xc2\xb0, \xcf\x88Gly(6) = \xe2\x88\x923.0\xc2\xb0). Molecules of both chiral senses are found in the centrosymmetric crystal. The C-terminus forms a hydrated Schellman motif, with water insertion into the potential 6 \xe2\x86\x92 1 hydrogen bond between Gly(1)CO and Gly(6)NH. NMR studies in CDCl3 suggest substantial retention of the multiple turn conformation observed in crystals. In solution the observed NOEs support local helical conformation at the two Dpg residues. "
"Single-crystal neutron diffraction has been used to determine the stereochemical course of the hydration of trans-crotonobetaine to l-(\xe2\x88\x92)-carnitine by the enzyme l-carnitine dehydratase. Firstly, an X-ray analysis of the undeuterated carnitinium salt [(CH3)3N-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-COOH]+[AuCl4]- confirmed that the absolute configuration at the C3 position of l-(\xe2\x88\x92)-carnitine (the CHOH group) is indeed R. This was accomplished using the gold atom as an anomalously-scattering source. Then stereospecifically deuterated l-(\xe2\x88\x92)-[2-D] carnitine was prepared by the hydration of trans-crotonobetaine in D2O using purified l-carnitine dehydratase from Escherichia coli. The subsequent neutron analysis of deuterated [(CH3)3N-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-COOH]+ [AuCl4]- revealed that the CHD group at position C2 also had the absolute R configuration, thus establishing that the addition of D2O across the CC double bond of trans-crotonobetaine proceeds by a stereospecific syn pathway. In contrast, all other hydration\xe2\x88\x92dehydration reactions examined thus far show that, when the proton added or abstracted is bonded to a carbon atom that is adjacent to a carboxylate group, the absolute stereochemistry of the resulting transformation is anti.

"3-Aminopyrazole derivatives are the first artificial templates that stabilize the \xce\xb2-sheet conformation in N/C-protected dipeptides by purely intermolecular interactions. In the complex two aminopyrazole molecules lie exactly above and below the peptide backbone. Binding to the top face of the peptide is strongly favored because it forms three cooperative hydrogen bonds simultaneously to the receptor molecule, whereas the bottom face has only two. Polymerizable 3-amino- and 3-amidopyrazoles have been made accessible in excellent yields by a general route starting from p-toluic acid. With 1H NMR titrations binding constants for the 1:1 complex of up to 880 M-1 have been determined in chloroform. The association constants are strongly influenced by the electronic character of the aminopyrazole derivative as well as by the steric demand of the peptide residues. Variable temperature studies prove that the complex is formed by dynamic hydrogen bonds and confirmed the preferential binding of the receptor molecules at the top face. By detailed Karplus-analysis of the NH-\xce\xb1-CH coupling constants in the complex a remarkable correlation between the dihedral angle \xce\xb8 and the degree of complexation was found, which shows that several amidopyrazoles are capable of forcing the dipeptide into an almost ideal \xce\xb2-sheet conformation. In glycine-containing dipeptides the third hydrogen bond slows down the free rotation around the C\xe2\x88\x92C/C\xe2\x88\x92N bond to almost zero. Intramolecular nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOE) provide additional evidence for the peptide\'s extended conformation, while strong reciprocal intermolecular NOEs give the final proof of the existence of the critical third hydrogen bond and the postulated mutual orientation of the complexation partners. First 1H NMR titrations with tripeptides show very promising results concerning the application of this concept to oligopeptides. "
"The transition state structure has been determined for the pH-independent solvolytic hydrolysis of NAD+. The structure is based on kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) measured for NAD+\'s labeled in various positions of the ribose ring and in the leaving group nitrogen. The KIEs for reactions performed at 100 \xc2\xb0C in 50 mM NaOAc (pH 4.0) were as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 1-15N, 1.020 \xc2\xb1 0.007; 1\xe2\x80\x98-14C, 1.016 \xc2\xb1 0.002; [1-15N,1\xe2\x80\x98-14C], 1.034 \xc2\xb1 0.002; 1\xe2\x80\x98-3H, 1.194 \xc2\xb1 0.005; 2\xe2\x80\x98-3H, 1.114 \xc2\xb1 0.004; 4\xe2\x80\x98-3H, 0.997 \xc2\xb1 0.001; 5\xe2\x80\x98-3H, 1.000 \xc2\xb1 0.003; 4\xe2\x80\x98-18O, 0.988 \xc2\xb1 0.007. The transition state structure was determined using bond energy/bond order vibrational analysis to predict KIEs for trial transition state models. The structure that most closely matches the experimental KIEs defines the transition state. A structure interpolation method was developed to generate trial transition state structures and thereby systematically search reaction coordinate space. Structures are generated by interpolation between reference structures, reactant NAD+ and a hypothetical {ribo-oxocarbenium ion plus nicotinamide} structure. The point in reaction coordinate space where all the predicted KIEs matched the measured ones was considered to locate the transition state structure. This occurred when the residual bond order to the leaving group nicotinamide, nLG,TS, was 0.02 (bond length = 2.65 \xc3\x85) and the bond order to the approaching nucleophile, nNu,TS, was 0.005 (3.00 \xc3\x85). Thus, bond-breaking and bond-making in this ANDN reaction are asynchronous, and the transition state has a highly oxocarbenium ion-like character. "
"Diphtheria toxin (DTA) uses NAD+ as an ADP-ribose donor to catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2. This inhibits protein biosynthesis and ultimately leads to cell death. In the absence of its physiological acceptor, DTA catalyzes the slow hydrolysis of NAD+ to ADP-ribose and nicotinamide, a reaction that can be exploited to measure kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) of isotopically labeled NAD+s. Competitive KIEs were measured by the radiolabel method for NAD+ molecules labeled at the following positions:\xe2\x80\x89 1-15N = 1.030 \xc2\xb1 0.004, 1\xe2\x80\x98-14C = 1.034 \xc2\xb1 0.004, (1-15N,1\xe2\x80\x98-14C) = 1.062 \xc2\xb1 0.010, 1\xe2\x80\x98-3H = 1.200 \xc2\xb1 0.005, 2\xe2\x80\x98-3H = 1.142 \xc2\xb1 0.005, 4\xe2\x80\x98-3H = 0.990 \xc2\xb1 0.002, 5\xe2\x80\x98-3H = 1.032 \xc2\xb1 0.004, 4\xe2\x80\x98-18O = 0.986 \xc2\xb1 0.003. The ring oxygen, 4\xe2\x80\x98-18O, KIE was also measured by whole molecule mass spectrometry (0.991 \xc2\xb1 0.003) and found to be within experimental error of that measured by the radiolabel technique, giving an overall average of 0.988 \xc2\xb1 0.003. The transition state structure of NAD+ hydrolysis was determined using a structure interpolation method to generate trial transition state structures and bond-energy/bond-order vibrational analysis to predict the KIEs of the trial structures. The predicted KIEs matched the experimental ones for a concerted, highly oxocarbenium ion-like transition state. The residual bond order to the leaving group was 0.02 (bond length = 2.65 \xc3\x85), while the bond order to the approaching nucleophile was 0.03 (2.46 \xc3\x85). This is an ANDN mechanism, with both leaving group and nucleophilic participation in the reaction coordinate. Fitting the transition state structure into the active site cleft of the X-ray crystallographic structure of DTA highlighted the mechanisms of enzymatic stabilization of the transition state. Desolvation of the nicotinamide ring, stabilization of the oxocarbenium ion by apposition of the side chain carboxylate of Glu148 with the anomeric carbon of the ribosyl moiety, and the placement of the substrate phosphate near the positively charged side chain of His21 are all consistent with the transition state features from KIE analysis.

"Alanyl ethyl phosphate (1) is an activated derivative of alanine that is functionally related to the corresponding aminoacyl adenylate, the initial activated amino acid intermediate in protein biosynthesis. To establish the inherent reactivity of these species, the kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of alanyl ethyl phosphate in water at 25 \xc2\xb0C were determined. There is catalysis by acid (k = 4 \xc3\x97 10-4 M-1s-1) and base (k = 1.7 M-1 s-1) along with two pH-independent processes (k = 3 \xc3\x97 10-5 and 1.6 \xc3\x97 10-3 s-1) that are connected as a kinetic titration curve of the amino group of alanyl ethyl phosphate (pKa = 7.8). The results are consistent with mechanisms proceeding via addition to the carbonyl of water or hydroxide with proton migrations. Reaction with methanol is slower than reactions with water while reaction with 2-propanol leads to complex products. In solutions sufficiently concentrated for 31P NMR analysis, alanyl ethyl phosphate also undergoes reactions that produce alanylalanine and other condensation products. Metal ions catalyze the hydrolysis reactions through complex formation. Cupric and zinc ions are most effective (\xe2\x88\xbc100-fold larger rate constant than water:\xe2\x80\x89 association constants > 100 M-1) with magnesium and calcium forming weaker and less reactive complexes. These results show that aminoacyl alkyl phosphates are sufficiently stable to be used in water and that metal ions can facilitate their reactions. Improved catalysts will be needed to facilitate biomimetic processes such as aminoacylation of t-RNA. "
"The numerous investigations that have focused on the iron binding site to explain the different affinity of hemoglobin for CO and O2 are still without success. Thus, this work addresses the problem of nonlocal effects, which have been disregarded so far. We have investigated the protein behavior in relation to the iron\xe2\x88\x92ligand nature. The present data show that different parts of the protein, which are not in close contact with the heme pocket, are effectively influenced by the nature of the iron\xe2\x88\x92ligand bond. Whereas oxyhemoglobin and carbonmonoxide hemoglobin in solution exhibit the same molecular shapes and helical contents, different electrostatic interactions in association with a redistribution of the strains occur in the protein matrix. Due to electric couplings of the heme to the protein, the whole molecule is sensitive to the chemical nature of the iron\xe2\x88\x92ligand bond. This suggests that long distance electrostatic interactions promote the energy transduction through the protein molecule. "
"The enzymatic conversion of glucose into ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP with several different isotopic labeling patterns is described. Enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway and enzyme-catalyzed hydrogen exchange were used to convert three types of isotopically labeled glucose into [1\xe2\x80\x98,2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98,4\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-2H6]NTPs (1\xe2\x88\x924), [3\xe2\x80\x98,4\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-2H4]UTP (5), [1\xe2\x80\x98,2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98,4\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-13C5]NTPs (6\xe2\x88\x929), and [3\xe2\x80\x98,4\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-2H4-1\xe2\x80\x98,2\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98,4\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-13C5]NTPs (10\xe2\x88\x9213), which were then used to synthesize a 30 nucleotide HIV TAR RNA. Representative NOESY and HSQC spectra were acquired to demonstrate the utility of the new labeling patterns. The spectral editing afforded by 2H and 13C labeling dramatically simplifies the crowded NOESY and HSQC spectra of RNA molecules. The synthetic methods described here will permit the preparation of several specifically deuterated and/or 13C-labeled forms of RNA which should be useful in NMR structural studies of large RNAs. "
"Formation of the cholesteric phase in aqueous lyotropic liquid crystals doped with cellulose derivatives has been studied utilizing hot stage polarized microscopy. Three ionic surfactantssodium decyl sulfate, cesium pentadecafluorooctanoate, and myristyltrimethylammonium bromidewere employed to obtain anionic or cationic lyonematics. After addition of chiral polymers (at polymer concentration \xe2\x88\xbc0.05\xe2\x88\x920.750 wt %) the samples were sealed in flat glass capillaries, and a magnetic field was applied to enhance the homogeneous orientation and formation of the fingerprint texture. Out of seven various cellulosic derivatives (five nonionic, one cationic, and one anionic), nonionic hydroxypropyl cellulose was the only compound that induced the cholesteric phase. The effective helical twisting power (HTP) of hydroxypropyl cellulose is 3\xe2\x88\x924 times higher in anionic lyonematics than in cationics. In both cationic and anionic media, the HTP decreases with an increase in the molecular weight of the chiral polymer. This behavior can be attributed to two factors:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) inhomogeneous distribution of chiral centers (formation of polymer bound chiral micelle clusters) and (ii) the finite character of intermicellar chiral distortion forces. The pitch of the polymer-doped cationic chiral lyonematic decreases as the temperature rises, indicating a closer packing along the helical axis with an increase in the thermal motion of the system. "
"By applying the three-dimensional template effect of copper(I), previously used for making various interlocking ring systems, a new disymmetrical [2]-catenate has been made which consists of two different interlocking rings. One ring contains a 2,9-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (dpp) unit whereas the other cycle incorporates both a dpp motif and a 2,2\xe2\x80\x98,6\xe2\x80\x98,2\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-terpyridine (terpy) fragment, the coordination site of these two chelates pointing toward the inside of the ring. Depending on the oxidation state of the central metal (Cu(I) or Cu(II)), and thus on its preferred coordination number, two distinct situations have been observed. With monovalent copper, the two dpp units interact with the metal and the terpy fragment remains free, at the outside of the molecule. By contrast, when the catenate is complexed to divalent copper, the terpy motif is bonded to the metal and it is now a dpp ligand which lies at the periphery of the complex. This dual coordination mode leads to dramatically different molecular shapes and properties for both forms. The molecular motion which interconverts the four- and the five-coordinate complexes can be triggered chemically, electrochemically, or photochemically by changing the oxidation state of the copper center (II/I). The process has been studied by electrochemistry and by UV-vis spectroscopy. Interestingly, once the stable 4-coordinate copper(I) complex has been oxidized to a thermodynamically unstable pseudo-tetrahedral copper(II) species, the rate of the gliding motion of the rings which will afford the stable 5-coordinate species (copper(II) coordinated to dpp and terpy) can be controlled at will. Under certain experimental conditions, the changeover process is extremely slow (weeks), and the 4-coordinate complex is more or less frozen. By contrast, addition of a coordinating counterion to the medium (Cl-) enormously speeds up the rearrangement and leads to the thermodynamically stable 5-coordinate complex within minutes. "
"The interconversion of cyclobutene-1,2-diones (1) and 1,2-bisketenes (RCCO)2 (2) has been surveyed for different combinations of substituents R = H, Me, t-Bu, Ph, Me3Si, CN, Cl, Br, R1O, alkynyl, and PhS. The bisketenes 2 have been generated by flash photolysis, and the kinetics of their conversion to 1 have been studied by time-resolved infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy. The rate constants of the ring closure of 2 are correlated by the ketene stabilization parameters (SE) and with calculated barriers. The rate constant of ring closure of the di-tert-butyl bisketene 2g to cyclobutenedione 1g is only 40 times smaller than for the dimethyl analogue, showing a rather modest steric barrier. The quinoketene 2s has a fast rate of ring closure, but not as fast as anticipated on the basis of calculated geometric and thermodynamic factors. A lag in the attainment of aromatic stabilization in the transition structure for ring closure is a possible cause of this diminished reactivity. "
"Reaction of aldehydes with allyltrimethylsilane promoted by BF3 (Sakurai reaction) affords fluorotrimethylsilane and a borylated homoallylic alcohol in a noncatalytic fashion. These reaction products have been identified through 13C NMR and 29Si NMR. A model system formed by acetaldehyde, allylsilane, and BH2F has been used to investigate the mechanism of this reaction at the DFT computational level. Four transition states, quite close in energy, have been found for the model reaction. These transition states, which explain the stereochemical features of the Sakurai reaction, correspond to eight-membered cyclic structures deriving from C\xe2\x88\x92C (tight) and Si\xe2\x88\x92F (loosen) bond formation and synclynal (gauche) disposition of the reacting double bonds. No antiperiplanar or six-membered cyclic transition structures have been located. "
"The condensation of diaminobenzenedithiol with sulfur monochloride leads to the chloride salt of the radical cation of 3,6-dichlorobenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d\xe2\x80\x98]bis(1,2,3-dithiazole), dichloro-[BB-123-DTA][Cl], which can be reduced to neutral dichloro-[BB-123-DTA] with triphenylantimony. A similar condensation with selenium tetrachloride leads, upon reduction, to the corresponding bis(1,2,3-thiaselenazole) dichloro-[BB-123-TSA]. The crystal and molecular structures of both compounds have been determined by X-ray diffraction. Both compounds, which are formally antiaromatic 16\xcf\x80-systems, exhibit internal bond lengths consistent with a quinoid formulation. The radical cations of both rings have been characterized by ESR spectroscopy; for dichloro-[BB-123-DTA]+ g = 2.0114 and aN = 0.201 mT, while for dichloro-[BB-123-TSA]+ g = 2.021 and aN = 0.44 mT. Further oxidation of both rings affords the corresponding dications, both of which have been characterized crystallographically as their AlCl4- salts. The structural features of these compounds are consistent with those expected for dithiazolylium (or thiaselenazolylium) derivatives. The structure and redox chemistry of the benzo[1,2-d:4,5-d\xe2\x80\x98]bis(1,2,3-dithiazole) framework is discussed in the light of the results of ab initio calculations. "
"The present study concerns the mode of action of a rigid rod-shaped polyol 1 and the corresponding hexamer 2. Proton flux mediated by 1 is shown to be strongly favored over metal cations and anions. The modest selectivity for monovalent cations (Rb+ > Cs+ > K+ > Na+ \xe2\x89\x88 Li+, Eisenman sequence II) is determined by the dehydration energy and is weakly influenced by the local electric (ionophoric) field. The induction of membrane defects was ruled out by the absence of dye leakage. Structural studies by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy imply that 1 aggregates in polar and nonpolar solvents, but not in lipid bilayers. Furthermore, it is shown that a very small fraction of 1 adopts a monomeric transmembrane tunnel-like structure which accounts for activity, while the remainder forms inactive self-assemblies. The above results suggest that 1 acts as a functional unimolecular proton wire which mimics the hydrogen-bonded chain mechanism found in bioenergetic systems. "
"A novel method for the synthesis of a series of silyl ethers of 3-(silyloxy)tetrahydrofuran-2-methanols bearing substituents at all four carbon atoms of the ring has been developed. The process involves first non-aldol aldol reaction of the epoxy silyl ether 8 to give the anti aldol product 9, stereoselective olefination and reduction to the (E)- and (Z)-allylic alcohols 10 and 11, diastereoselective epoxidation of these alcohols to give any of the four diastereomeric epoxy alcohols 12\xe2\x88\x9215, silylation of the alcohols to give the epoxy silyl ethers 27\xe2\x88\x9230, and final Lewis acid catalyzed rearrangement of the epoxy silyl ethers to give the desired products 31\xe2\x88\x9233 and 36. In the first three instances, good yields of the desired 3-(silyloxy)-2-((silyloxy)methyl)tetrahydrofurans were obtained. However, rearrangement of the epoxy silyl ether 27 gave a mixture of products, the bis-silyl ether 36 as well as the products of a second non-aldol aldol process. This hydride migration to give the 3,5-bis((trialkylsilyl)oxy)-2,4-dimethylalkanal 35 or its internally protected 1-(silyloxy)pyran 38 can be made to occur in good yield. "
"The synthesis of (\xe2\x88\x92)-stipiamide (1) is reported together with the designed enynes 2 (6,7-dehydrostipiamide) and 3 that are now shown to reverse the multidrug resistance (MDR) of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7adrR). Stipiamide was assembled using a Stille coupling with (E)-vinyl iodide 17 and (Z)-stannyl amide 16 in 78% yield. (E)-Vinyl iodide 17 was made using a Takai reaction and a selective dihydroxylation of the terminal olefin of nonconjugated diene 7 using the Sharpless AD-mix reagent. The precursor to 16, (E,Z)-stannyl diene ester 13, was assembled with high selectivity in a single operation using a tandem syn-addition of tributyltin cuprate to acetylene followed by conjugate addition to ethyl propiolate. Structural variants 2 and 3 were assembled using palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira couplings with vinyl iodides 17 and 35 and acetylenes 22 and 26 in high yield at near 1:1 stoichiometry. Compound 2 was found to be far less toxic than stipiamide and performed much better as an MDR reversal agent. Compound 3 was better still due to even lower toxicity. "
"Ferrochelatase catalyzes Fe2+ insertion into porphyrins, and is inhibited by Hg2+. Resonance Raman spectra of mesoporphyrin IX show that binding to ferrochelatase restricts the conformation of the propionate side chains, but does not perturb the ring conformation. However, a pronounced perturbation is seen in the ternary complex with Hg2+. Several additional RR bands are activated, including some arising from IR-active vibrations, establishing loss of an effective symmetry center. Out-of-plane modes appear in the low frequency region. The strongest of these bands, \xce\xb35 and \xce\xb36, correspond to pyrrole tilting vibrations, which are in the same symmetry class as a doming distortion of the porphyrin. All four pyrrole N atoms are pointing toward the same side of the porphyrin plane, a geometry expected to facilitate Fe2+ insertion. This distortion is proposed to result from occupation of a metal-binding site, proximate to the prophyrin, which promotes insertion of Fe2+, while occupation by Hg2+ is inhibitory. "
"The octahedral hexazirconium cluster compound [PPh4]3[Zr6Cl18H5] has been structurally characterized by both neutron and X-ray single-crystal diffraction studies. The compound [PPh4]3[Zr6Cl18H5]\xc2\xb73CH2Cl2 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1\xcc\x84 with unit cell parameters of a = 15.993(3), b = 22.237(3), and c = 14.670(4) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb1 = 95.31(1), \xce\xb2 = 112.07(2), and \xce\xb3 = 82.06(2)\xc2\xb0, V = 4784(2) \xc3\x853, and Z = 2 at ambient temperature and a = 15.780(6), b = 21.96(3), and c = 14.521(7) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb1 = 94.96(8), \xce\xb2 = 111.59(4), and \xce\xb3 = 81.72(5)\xc2\xb0, V = 4627(11) \xc3\x853, and Z = 2 at T = 15 K. The hydrogen atoms in the cluster anion, [Zr6Cl18H5]3-, were found to be distributed at the centers of the eight triangular faces of the Zr6 octahedron from neutron diffraction data. The occupancy parameters of the sites range from 0.32 to 0.92 with a total of 5.3(1) hydrogen atoms per cluster, close to the value from 1H NMR measurement (5.0). The average Zr\xe2\x88\x92H distance is 1.96(4) \xc3\x85. A variable temperature 1H NMR study indicated that the cluster hydrogen atoms undergo rapid movement at room temperature. One of the five hydrogen atoms in the cluster [Zr6Cl18H5]3- was readily removed as a proton with primary linear amines with formation of the corresponding ammonium cations, while the cluster anion, [Zr6Cl18H5]3-, was thus converted into a new cluster anion, [Zr6Cl18H4]4-. The feasibility of such a deprotonation reactions is controlled by the size of both the Lewis base and the cavity available on the Zr3 triangular faces of the Zr6 clusters, and also by the basicity of the deprotonating reagents. Two products, [PPh4]4[Zr6Cl18H4]\xc2\xb74CH2Cl2 and [H3NEt]4[Zr6Cl18H4]\xc2\xb74MeCN from the deprotonation reactions were characterized by X-ray crystallography. "
"Multilayer thin films consisting of anionic \xce\xb1-zirconium phosphate (\xce\xb1-ZrP) sheets, tetrameric zirconium hydroxide cations [Zr4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+ (Zr48+), and alkanediylbis(phosphonic acid) (CnBPA) have been grown on silicon and gold surfaces by sequential adsorption reactions. The thin films were characterized by ellipsometry, X-ray diffraction, reflectance infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Alternately dipping cationic substrates into exfoliated \xce\xb1-ZrP-containing suspensions, aqueous zirconium oxychloride, and ethanolic C16BPA solutions generates a mixed ionic/covalent multilayer structure. The tetrameric Zr48+ cation adsorbs onto the \xce\xb1-ZrP surface, providing a covalent anchoring point for the growth of the C16BPA layer. Adsorbing a second layer of zirconium ions onto the C16BPA layer allows one to continue the layer growth sequence using either covalent (metal/phosphonate) or ionic (\xce\xb1-ZrP/polycation) interlayer connections. A multilayer film with a repeating \xce\xb1-ZrP/Zr48+/C16BPA/Zr48+ sequence is sufficiently well-ordered in the stacking direction to give a Bragg peak in the diffraction pattern. The intensities of infrared absorbances in the symmetric and asymmetric C\xe2\x88\x92H stretching regions, which arise from C16BPA, are linear with the C16BPA layer number. This \xe2\x80\x9cmix and match\xe2\x80\x9d approach provides a versatile means of assembling multilayer heterostructures from both ionic and covalent building blocks, with essentially any desired sequence of layers.

"The two available crystallographic structures of cobalamin dependent enzymes, the 27 kDa fragment of the methylcobalamin-dependent enzyme, methionine synthase, from Escherichia coli [Drennan, C. L. et al. Science 1994, 266, 1669] and the 5\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyadenosylcobalamin-dependent enzyme methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase from Propionibacterium shermanii [Mancia, F. et al. Structure 1996, 4, 339], show striking similarities despite the differences in reaction mechanism. In particular, the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole group is detached and replaced by a histidine group of the enzyme. Here we present an analysis of Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopic data for both 5\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyadenosylcobalamin and aquocobalamin bound to methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase in the absence of substrate. The analysis is conducted with a suite of programs called AUTOFIT 1.0 [Chance, et al. Biochemistry 1996, 35, 9014], which allows an evenhanded comparison of the goodness-of-fit of the EXAFS data to a varied grid of simulations based on the ab initio EXAFS code FEFF 6.01. The X-ray edge data indicate an increase in effective nuclear charge of the metal ion of the enzyme bound 5\xe2\x80\x98-deoxyadeonsylcobalamin compared to the corresponding free cobalamin, and the EXAFS results show small decreases in equatorial and no significant change in the Co\xe2\x88\x92C bond length (despite the potential elongation of the Co\xe2\x88\x92N(His) bond) upon cofactor binding to the enzyme. Thus, the change in coordination of the nitrogenous axial ligand engineered by the enzyme does not significantly contribute to a trans effect in the ground state. Weakening of the Co\xe2\x88\x92C bond must be initiated by substrate binding. In addition, the global mapping technique resolves discrepancies between previous EXAFS results and crystallographic data on aquocobalamin. "
"Electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopic studies of oxygenated cobalt (oxyCo) [tetraphenylporphyrin(TPP)][1-methylimidazole (1-MeIm)], an active site model of oxyCo-substituted globins (functional and EPR-active [S = 1/2] analogues of oxygen carrying hemoproteins), are carried out in order to examine the correlation of oxygen affinity with electron-nuclear coupling parameters and metal\xe2\x88\x92ligand bond lengths. ESEEM demonstrates that the magnitude of the electron-nuclear hyperfine and nuclear quadrupole couplings to the directly-coordinated 14N of 1-MeIm decrease (Aiso, from 3.54 to 3.04 MHz; e2qQ, from 2.39 to 2.08 MHz) as the solvent compositon is varied from 0 to 50% (v/v) dichloromethane in toluene. For oxyCo[(o-R)1TPP][1-MeIm] (where R = \xe2\x88\x92H, \xe2\x88\x92NHCOC(CH3)3, \xe2\x88\x92NHCOCH3, or \xe2\x88\x92NHCONHC6H5, an ortho substitutent on one of the four meso phenyls of TPP), couplings to the axial nitrogen decrease (Aiso, from 3.54 to 3.07 MHz; e2qQ, from 2.39 to 2.09 MHz) with increased electron-withdrawing strength of R, i.e., with increased acidity of the amide proton of R that may interact with the bound dioxygen. EXAFS measurements, and analysis using ab initio EXAFS codes and global mapping, find that the cobalt\xe2\x88\x92axial nitrogen (Nax) bond of oxyCoTPP-1-MeIm shortens by 0.18 \xc2\xb1 0.06 \xc3\x85 when the solvent is changed from 100% toluene (Co\xe2\x88\x92Nax = 2.12 \xc3\x85) to 50% toluene/50% dichloromethane (Co\xe2\x88\x92Nax = 1.94 \xc3\x85). The average cobalt\xe2\x88\x92equatorial nitrogens (1.94\xe2\x88\x921.96 \xc3\x85) and cobalt\xe2\x88\x92oxygen (1.95\xe2\x88\x921.98 \xc3\x85) distances are unchanged within the error. Similar results were obtained when oxyCoTPP-1-MeIm was compared (in 100% toluene) with its (o-NHCONHC6H5)1TPP counterpart, where the cobalt\xe2\x88\x92ligand bond lengths are indistinguishable from those of oxyCoTPP-1-MeIm in 50% toluene/50% dichloromethane. Increasing the polarity of the solvent and of the vicinity of the bound dioxygen increases oxygen affinity of the metal due to an increase in the ionicity of the cobalt\xe2\x88\x92dioxygen bond that is manifested in reduction in electron-nuclear couplings to the axial nitrogen [Lee et al. Biochemistry 1994, 33, 7609] and shortening of the cobalt\xe2\x88\x92axial nitrogen bond. These ESEEM and EXAFS characterizations of metal\xe2\x88\x92ligand interactions demonstrate the correlation of electron-nuclear coupling and metal\xe2\x88\x92ligand bond lengths with oxygen affinity of hemoprotein model complexes.

"In the present work we report results from CP, REDOR, and TEDOR NMR experiments carried out to locate the fluoride anions within the three-dimensional framework of the silicate octadecasil. Accurate Si\xe2\x88\x92F distances were obtained through measurements of the 19F/29Si dipolar couplings from these experiments. Weighted, nonlinear least-squares fittings of the REDOR and TEDOR data for the silicons in the D4R units gave an average value of D = 1150 \xc2\xb1 50 Hz from which the Si\xe2\x88\x92F interatomic distance was calculated to be 2.69 \xc2\xb1 0.04 \xc3\x85. This distance is in excellent agreement with the value of 2.63 \xc3\x85 reported from the X-ray determined single crystal structure and confirms that the F- anions are located inside the D4R units. Calculations and fittings of the REDOR and TEDOR data for the silicons not in the D4R gave D = 120 \xc2\xb1 20 Hz when the specific geometrical (tetrahedral) arrangement of the multiple equivalent fluoride anions surrounding the Si nuclei in these T-2 sites was taken into account. This yields a Si\xe2\x88\x92F distance of 5.7 \xc2\xb1 0.4 \xc3\x85, compared to the value 5.69 \xc3\x85 obtained from the diffraction measurements. Factors influencing the selection of the optimum experiments to perform in different situations and the dependence of the results on experimental variables are discussed. These studies clearly establish the viability and reliability of 19F/29Si REDOR and TEDOR NMR experiments to obtain distance information which can be used to determine the precise location of fluorine-containing species within such framework structures or in suitable cases to assist in the determination of the framework structure itself where it is unknown.

"Crystal structures of a series of five symmetrically substituted N,N-bisarylformamidines ArNHCHNAr with Ar = X-C6H4, X = p-OCH3 (IV), p-CH3 (V), p-F (VI), p-NO2 (VII), and m-Br (VIII) have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and complete the series studied previously where X = H (I), p-Br (II), and p-Cl (III). In addition, the results of variable-temperature 15N CPMAS NMR experiments performed on 15N-labeled I, II, and IV are reported. All compounds form cyclic dimers linked by two NH\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N hydrogen bonds which can form two different tautomers, a and b, interconverting by fast double proton transfers. The NMR experiments indicate three types of amidines characterized by different magnitudes of the equilibrium constants Kab of the tautomerism. In dimers of type such as V\xe2\x88\x92VIII, we find Kab \xe2\x89\xaa 1 (i.e., only a single tautomer in the temperature range between 100 and 300 K). In this case, the hydrogen-bonded protons are ordered and can be localized by XRD. Furthermore, the C\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N bond lengths and torsional and valence angles involving the two aryl groups of an amidine unit are different. For dimers such as II and III, characteristic temperature dependent 15N CPMAS NMR line shape changes are observed indicating that Kab = 1 within the margin of error. Rate constants of the tautomerism can in this case be obtained by line shape analysis. For this degeneracy to occur, the aryl group conformations at both amidine nitrogen atoms must be similar. XRD then observes disordered hydrogen-bond protons and, in principle, also disordered nitrogen atoms. However, in practice, the disorder of the latter is not resolved leading to the observation of equalized C\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7N bond lengths. Finally, dimers (I, IV) represent an intermediate case with Kab < 1, which could be labeled as \xe2\x80\x9cdynamic partial order\xe2\x80\x9d. The implications of the molecular structure and the hydrogen bond and proton transfer characteristics are discussed. "
"Solid state NMR, calorimetry, and density functional theory (DFT) all provide a consistent interpretation of the acidity of the solid acid catalyst (SG)nAlCl2, which is prepared by reacting aluminum chloride with conditioned silica gel. These studies firmly establish that the acid sites are Br\xc3\xb8nsted in nature and that their strength is significantly greater than those in zeolites. Proton NMR results, including experiments exploiting 1H\xe2\x88\x9227Al dipolar couplings, demonstrate that the Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid sites have an isotropic 1H chemical shift of 5.7 ppm and a concentration of 0.58 mmol/g. The strongest sites on this solid acid, present at 0.03 mmol/g, have \xe2\x88\x92\xce\x94Hav values of 52 kcal/mol for reaction with pyridine. A value of 44 kcal/mol is maintained for incremental addition of pyridine up to 0.1 mmol/g. In comparison, \xe2\x88\x92\xce\x94Hav for the strongest sites in zeolite HZSM-5 is only 42 kcal/mol. 15N magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR studies of adsorbed pyridine and 31P MAS NMR of trimethylphosphine confirm the Br\xc3\xb8nsted nature of these acid sites. The 13C isotropic chemical shift of acetone-2-13C on (SG)nAlCl2 (245 ppm) is identical to that measured in 100% H2SO4. 13C in situ NMR studies of ethylene and propene oligomerization show that the activity of (SG)nAlCl2 is far greater than that of zeolites. Cyclopentenyl carbenium ions are formed in significant yields in those reactions as well as during skeletal isomerization and cracking of cyclohexane at 433 K on (SG)nAlCl2. Local DFT calculations at the SVWN/DZVP2 level were used to provide predictions of the structure and energetics of the catalyst. The acidity (defined as the deprotonation energy corrected for zero-point and thermal contributions) obtained from these calculations ranges from 275.5 to 293.4 kcal/mol. Two of the three (SG)nAlCl2 models considered are more strongly acidic than a HZSM-5 cluster model treated at the same level of theory. The aggregate evidence from this study strongly supports classification of (SG)nAlCl2 as a catalyst with a Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid strength on the threshold of superacidity. "
"The electronic spectra of a series of adenine derivatives have been investigated with respect to the number of electronic transitions, their intensities, and transition moments. The experimental work includes linear dichroism (LD) measurements on samples partially oriented in stretched polymer poly(vinyl alcohol) films, fluorescence anisotropy (FA), and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD). The UV spectra of both 7-methyladenine (7MA) and 9-methyladenine (9MA) are resolved into contributions from five \xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* transitions (I\xe2\x88\x92V). Their polarizations relative to the C4\xe2\x88\x92C5 axis are for 7MA +45\xc2\xb0 (I, 36\xe2\x80\x89600 cm-1), \xe2\x88\x9216\xc2\xb0 (II, 39\xe2\x80\x89500 cm-1), \xe2\x88\x9228\xc2\xb0 (III, 42\xe2\x80\x89600 cm-1), +76\xc2\xb0 (IV, 45\xe2\x80\x89800 cm-1) and \xe2\x88\xbc\xe2\x88\x9229\xc2\xb0 (V, \xe2\x88\xbc47\xe2\x80\x89700 cm-1); and for 9MA +66\xc2\xb0 (I, 36\xe2\x80\x89700 cm-1), +19\xc2\xb0 (II, 38\xe2\x80\x89820 cm-1), \xe2\x88\x9215\xc2\xb0 (III, 43\xe2\x80\x89400 cm-1), \xe2\x88\x9221\xc2\xb0 (IV, 46\xe2\x80\x89800 cm-1), and \xe2\x88\xbc\xe2\x88\x9264\xc2\xb0 (V, \xe2\x88\xbc48\xe2\x80\x89320 cm-1). The experimental results are correlated with results from semiempirical INDO/S and ab initio CIS/6-31G(d) and CASPT2 molecular orbital calculations. The transition moments are found to be conserved when the adenine amino group has been substituted with either one or two methyl groups. In addition, LD and MCD spectra for 6-(dimethylamino)-9-ethylpurine, which is soluble in nonpolar solvents, have been measured in stretched polyethylene film and cyclohexane, respectively. The results indicate that the electronic transition moments of the 9-substituted adenine chromophore are essentially the same in a polar and a nonpolar solvent. On the basis of the results for 7MA and 9MA, the reduced LD and absorption spectra of adenine are analyzed in terms of contributions from the 7-H and 9-H tautomers of adenine. By comparison with theoretical and experimental results for purine and 2-aminopurine regarding the position of the lowest n \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* transition, we are able to confidently position the lowest n \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* transition in 9MA very close to the lowest \xcf\x80 \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* transition. The proximity of the first 1n\xcf\x80* and 1\xcf\x80\xcf\x80* states in adenine might be related to the effecient nonradiative deactivation of the lowest excited 1\xcf\x80\xcf\x80* state. "
"Conformational substates (CSs) of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), essential for its dynamics and function, are spectroscopically revealed by a new low-temperature method. Hydrated films of the sodium salt of DNA containing up to \xe2\x89\x88100% of the B-form were quenched into the glassy metastable state at 77 K. Attainment of equilibrium in the glass \xe2\x86\x92 liquid transition region by interconversion of CSs was followed isothermally by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Kinetic analysis of difference spectra revealed two sequential relaxation processes and the spectral patterns of two distinct CSs of B-DNA, with exponential interconversion kinetics for each vibrational mode. The characteristic spectral features of the two CSs are also found in the spectrum of B-DNA in aqueous solution. The relevance of these CSs is discussed with respect to the crystalline state and DNA\xe2\x88\x92protein interaction. "
"Two one-dimensional 1H NMR techniques for efficiently screening libraries of compounds for binding to macromolecules are described that exploit the changes in relaxation or diffusion rates of small molecules which occur upon complex formation. The techniques are demonstrated by detecting ligands that bind to the FK506 binding protein and the catalytic domain of stromelysin in the presence of compounds that do not bind to these proteins. These one-dimensional methods detect complex formation between a ligand and a macromolecule and thus eliminate false positives often observed with other techniques. In addition, since these methods monitor signals of the uncomplexed compound rather than the bound ligand or macromolecule, ligands for macromolecules of unlimited size can be detected. Furthermore, active compounds can be directly identified from a mixture, significantly reducing the time and material needed for screening large libraries of compounds. "
"Density-functional chemical shielding calculations are reported for the alanine dipeptide with a variety of backbone torsion angles and for methane and N-methylacetamide complexes with rare gases, monatomic ions, water, and other amides. These fragment systems model electrostatic, nonbonded, and hydrogen bonding interactions in proteins and have been investigated at a variety of geometries. The results are compared to empirical formulas that relate intermolecular shielding effects to peptide group magnetic anisotropies, electrostatic polarization of the C\xe2\x88\x92H and N\xe2\x88\x92H bonds, magnetic contributions from C\xe2\x88\x92C and C\xe2\x88\x92H bonds, and close contact effects. Close contacts are found to deshield protons involved in close nonbonded contacts that typically occur in hydrogen bonds. \xe2\x80\x9cLone pair\xe2\x80\x9d charges improve the model for electrostatic effects and are important for understanding the angular dependence of shifts for protons involved in hydrogen bonds. C\xe2\x88\x92C and C\xe2\x88\x92H bond anisotropy contributions help to explain the torsional dependence of amide proton shifts in alanine dipeptide. Good agreement is found between the empirical formulas and the quantum chemistry results, allowing a reassessment of empirical formulas that are used in the analysis of chemical shift dispersion in proteins.

"Ab initio CASSCF calculations with the 6-31G basis set are reported for the fragmentation reaction of thymine dimer radical cation. The unpaired electron of thymine dimer radical cation is localized on the lengthened C6\xe2\x88\x92C6\xe2\x80\x98 bond, and the fragmentation starts with the cleavage of this bond. The puckering of the cyclobutane ring (C6\xe2\x88\x92C6\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92C5\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92C5) leads to one of the C6 atoms being pyramidal and the other being planar in the initial thymine dimer radical cation structure. During the C6\xe2\x88\x92C6\xe2\x80\x98 bond breaking step, the pyramidal C6 takes on a sp3 hybridization to accept the localized unpaired electron; the planar C6\xe2\x80\x98 takes on a sp2 hybridization with an empty p orbital. In the next step of the fragmentation, the breaking of the C5\xe2\x88\x92C5\xe2\x80\x98 bond, the localized unpaired electron on C6 pairs up with one of the electrons formerly of the C5\xe2\x88\x92C5\xe2\x80\x98 bond to form a neutral thymine monomer while the other electron of the C5\xe2\x88\x92C5\xe2\x80\x98 bond moves to the other ring to form a thymine radical cation. The reaction proceeds stepwise and exothermally. The puckering of the cyclobutane ring of thymine dimer plays an important role in determining the fragmentation path and the spin distribution at the final stacked pair. "
"Ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the QCISD(FULL)/DZ+P level of theory were carried out on the hydrogen trioxides H2O3 and H2O/O2 (O2 is 3\xce\xa3g-) and their Li+ ion and proton adducts to determine the binding energies (Li+ affinity and proton affinity) for H2O3\xe2\x88\x92Li+ and H2O\xe2\x88\x92Li+\xe2\x88\x92O2. Calculations include the thermochemistry at 298 K and enthalpy corrections for comparison with experimental values. Our prediction for the binding energy of Li+ to H2O3 is 33.0 kcal/mol, which closely resembles that between Li+ and homologous molecules of water and H2O2. In the case of the H2O\xe2\x88\x92Li+\xe2\x88\x92O2 system, the process may be that a primary product of H2OLi+ would then bind to oxygen (or O2Li+ to water). Binding energies of H2OLi+ or Li+ to O2 are 8.6 or 5.2 kcal/mol, respectively, which are smaller than those required for adduct formation under conventional experimental conditions. The overall results suggest the validity of our recent experimental detections of Li+ ion attachment to hydrogen trioxide. But the detection of the H2O\xe2\x88\x92Li+\xe2\x88\x92O2 complex may not be possible. "
"A hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach is used to elucidate structural and energetic features of amide hydrolysis by the enzyme papain. The role of the enzyme in stabilizing the thiolate\xe2\x88\x92imidazolium ion pair is examined and the potential energy pathway for the subsequent attack of the cysteine anion and proton transfer from the imidazolium cation is determined. The reaction is found to be concerted rather than stepwise, and the transition state for the reaction is located. The effect of residue mutations both on the ion pair stability and on the barrier to amide hydrolysis is explored and found to be in agreement with experiment. In this work both high-level electronic structure and semiempirical MO methods are used, with location and characterization of stationary structures. Rearrangement of the enzyme in response to the changing electronic structure of the active site is also considered. "
"A computational investigation of the conformational preferences of 2-phenethylamine has been carried out with a variety of techniques. To determine the intrinsic (in the absence of a solvent medium) conformational preferences of the 2-phenethylamine system, ab initio calculations at various levels of theory up to the MP2/6-311+G(d,p)//MP2/6-31G(d,p) level were carried out. This is the most sophisticated level of theory that has been applied to this biologically important system to date. In the absence of a solvent medium, phenethylamines prefer a folded gauche conformation for both the charged and neutral amines, indicating a favorable interaction between the amino group and the aromatic ring. To probe the nature of this intramolecular interaction further the effects of ring substituents on the conformational preferences were studied. The results have been compared to those obtained with semiempirical and molecular mechanics force field methods. The molecular mechanics force fields employing default parameters typically performed poorly for this system, but the results were improved significantly if the electrostatic charges were replaced. The effects of aqueous solvation have also been investigated with the GB/SA and the SM2 continuum solvation models. The best agreement with experiment is obtained when the MP2/6-311+G(d,p)//MP2/6-31G(d,p) results are combined with the SM2-calculated solvent effect. Results of nearly the same quality can be obtained if the solvent effect is calculated with the GB/SA solvation model using AM1-CM1A charges. "
"In this paper we have used a DFT (B3LYP) approach to investigate the potential energy surface for the reaction between ethylene and (chloromethyl)zinc chloride (ClCH2ZnCl), which represent a model system for the Simmons\xe2\x88\x92Smith cyclopropanation reaction. Two reaction channels have been found:\xe2\x80\x89 one leads to the cyclopropane product (addition channel) and the other to the propene product (insertion channel). The addition reaction has an activation energy of 24.7 kcal mol-1 and, as experimentally found, is favored with respect to the insertion, which is characterized by a larger activation energy (36.0 kcal mol-1). The addition transition state corresponds to a three-centered structure which explains the stereochemical features which have been experimentally observed for this reaction. A simple diabatic model is used to rationalize the reactivity pattern that characterizes the Simmons\xe2\x88\x92Smith cyclopropanation and the different behavior observed for the reaction between singlet methylene 1CH2 and olefins. "
"The potential energy surfaces for the insertion reactions of methylene and fluorinated methylenes into the H2, HF, and F2 molecules were studied by density functional, many body perturbation, and coupled-cluster theories. These methods predict the barrier for the CF2 insertion into the hydrogen molecule to be about 33 kcal/mol, that is, significantly lower than previous estimates. A new transition state was found in this system for the reaction path which leads to CHF + HF. However the transition state for this metathesis channel is about 25 kcal/mol higher than that of the insertion channel. For the fluoromethylene insertion into H2 the predicted activation energy is about 8 kcal/mol. The CH2 insertion into F2 proceeds without a barrier. The peculiarity of the insertion reactions between carbenes and HF involves formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex. The CH2\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7HF complex is bound by about 10 kcal/mol relative to CH2 + HF. Coupled-cluster methods predict a small (ca. 3 kcal/mol) barrier for transformation of this complex into CH3F. However, this barrier lies 7 kcal/mol below reactants CH2 + HF. In the case of the CHF insertion into HF the analogous barrier is higher and lies ca. 2 kcal/mol above reactants. "
"Two possible mechanisms for dioxygen cleavage on non-heme diiron enzyme models are studied with an approximate molecular orbital method, the extended H\xc3\xbcckel method. Diiron peroxo model complexes with different \xce\xbc-\xce\xb71:\xce\xb71-O2 and \xce\xbc-\xce\xb72:\xce\xb72-O2 binding modes are distorted to corresponding dioxo complexes along an assumed O\xe2\x88\x92O bond cleavage reaction coordinate. Fragment molecular orbital (FMO) and Walsh diagram analyses clarify the bonding and orbital interactions. While the \xcf\x80g* orbitals of O2 are initially occupied by two electrons, in the first dioxygen binding step two other electrons are effectively transferred from the \xe2\x80\x9ct2g\xe2\x80\x9d block to O2 to form O22-. To cleave the dioxygen O\xe2\x88\x92O bond, it is necessary further to fill the \xcf\x83u* orbital (high lying and unoccupied in the peroxide). The computations suggest that the \xce\xbc-\xce\xb71:\xce\xb71-O2 mode is more effective for electron transfer from the d-block orbitals to the \xcf\x83u*. Our calculations indicate that a C3v- or D2d-distorted methane can be activated if a coordinatively unsaturated iron, which has been proposed to exist in the diamond Fe2(\xce\xbc-O)2 core of intermediate Q of methane monooxygenase, is generated. The complex is suggested to include a five-coordinate carbon species with an Fe\xe2\x88\x92CH4 bond. We propose possible concerted reaction pathways for the conversion of methane to methanol on the supposed diiron active site of methane monooxygenase. Inversion at a five-coordinate carbon species is suggested to reasonably occur in an initially formed complex of methane and a model of intermediate Q, leading to inversion of stereochemistry at a labeled carbon center.

"High-level ab initio and density functional theory calculations were carried out on cyclopropenyl anion (1) and related species. The parent c-C3H3- ion is predicted to be unstable with respect to electron loss whereas its cyano-substituted derivatives are attractive synthetic targets. MCSCF structures for singlet and triplet cyclopropenyl anion are reported and contrasted to the results obtained from more modest computations. Energetic quantities for 1 were computed including its proton affinity, destabilization energy, singlet\xe2\x88\x92triplet gap, electron binding energy, and ring-opening isomerization energy. The allylic C\xe2\x88\x92H bond strength for cyclopropene also is given. Mono-, di-, and tricyanocyclopropenyl anions were investigated too, and their conjugate acids have lower pKa\'s than cyclopropene by up to 70.4 kcal/mol or 52 pKa units. "
"In the isoelectronic series methylphenylborenide, methylphenylcarbene, and methylphenylnitrenium, fundamental differences are predicted for singlet state geometries, singlet\xe2\x88\x92triplet state splittings, barriers to singlet 1,2-hydrogen migration, and sensitivity of 1,2-hydrogen migration to solvent effects in n-heptane and acetonitrile. We conclude that isoelectronic analogies are dangerous for systems having different formal charges, and that the interaction of the divalent center with a conjugating substituent is very sensitive to the electron donating or withdrawing nature (and power) of the hypovalent atom. Solvent effects on the singlet\xe2\x88\x92triplet splitting result from static polarity differences whereas the solvent effects on 1,2-hydrogen migration result primarily from polarizability differences. For the experimentally characterized carbene case, extensive comparison of calculated and measured results is provided. "
"Hydroxysulfinyl radical (1), hydrogensulfonyl radical (2), and dihydroxysulfane (6) were generated in the gas phase by collisional reduction of the corresponding cations and studied by the variable-time and photoexcitation methods of neutralization\xe2\x88\x92reionization mass spectrometry and by ab initio and RRKM calculations. Radicals 1 and 2 were thermodynamically and kinetically stable. Two rotamers of 1, syn-1 and anti-1, were found computationally to be local energy minima. The computations suggested a complex potential energy surface for dissociations of 1. The minimum-energy reaction path was the rate-determining isomerization to 2 followed by fast loss of H\xe2\x80\xa2 to form SO2. Direct H\xe2\x80\xa2 loss from 1 was kinetically disfavored. Cleavage of the S\xe2\x88\x92OH bond in 1 was highly endothermic and became kinetically significant at excitations >325 kJ mol-1. In contrast to ab initio/RRKM predictions, 1 formed by vertical reduction of hydroxysulfinyl cation (1+) dissociated mainly to OH\xe2\x80\xa2 and SO, whereas loss of H\xe2\x80\xa2 was less significant. Both dissociations showed microsecond kinetics as established by variable-time measurements. Photoexcitation of nondissociating 1 opened the H-loss channel, whereas collisional excitation did not change the branching ratio for the H\xe2\x80\xa2 and OH\xe2\x80\xa2 loss channels. The experimental results pointed to the formation of a large fraction of metastable and dissociative excited electronic states of 1 upon vertical electron transfer. Radical 2 was cogenerated with 1 by vertical reduction of a mixture of 1+ and 2+ produced by highly exothermic protonation of SO2 with H3+. Pronounced loss of H\xe2\x80\xa2 from 2 occurred following collisional neutralization in accordance with RRKM predictions. Dihydroxysulfane (6) was stable following collisional neutralization of the cation-radical 6\xe2\x80\xa2+. The G2(MP2) potential energy surface predicted the isomerization to hydrogensulfinic acid (7) followed by loss of water to be the lowest-energy dissociation of 6. RRKM calculations showed the 6 \xe2\x86\x92 7 isomerization to be the rate-determining step. Cation-radical 6\xe2\x80\xa2+ also eliminated water through unimolecular isomerization to a stable nonclassical isomer, OS\xe2\x80\xa2+\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7H2O (9). The thermochemistry of the neutral and ionic systems is discussed. The important role of excited electronic states in the formation of radicals by vertical electron transfer is emphasized. "
"The influence of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), and 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC) on the mixing behavior of phospholipids derived from 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DMPE) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) has been examined in the fluid bilayer state by means of nearest-neighbor recognition methods (Davidson, S. K. M.; Regen, S. L. Chem. Rev. 1997, 97, 1269). When disulfide-based dimers derived from DMPE and DSPE were allowed to undergo monomer exchange at 60 \xc2\xb0C, in the presence of 50 mol % of DPPC, an equilibrium molar ratio of heterodimer to each homodimer was found to be 1.95 \xc2\xb1 0.07; with DMPC as the diluent, a small but significant level of nearest-neighbor recognition was observed (i.e., the dimer ratio was 1.86 \xc2\xb1 0.02). In sharp contrast, the use of DLPC resulted in a very strong demixing effect, which was characterized by a dimer ratio of 0.88 \xc2\xb1 0.04. The mechanistic and practical implications of these findings are briefly discussed. "
" The cdc25A protein phosphatase inhibitor dysidiolide (1) has been synthesized enantioselectively, starting from the enantiomerically pure ketal enone 2 and using a cationic rearrangement as the key step to produce the fully substituted bicyclic core of the natural product. Once the central portion of 1 was established, elaboration of the side chains was accomplished expediently via steps that included (1) vinyl cuprate displacement of an iodide to complete the C-1 side chain, (2) a highly diastereoselective oxazaborolidine-catalyzed (CBS) reduction to form carbinol 11, and (3) photochemical oxidation of 11 to generate the \xce\xb3-hydroxybutenolide functionality of 1. Additionally, this synthesis proves the absolute stereochemistry of dysidiolide (1). "
"Synthesis of new cyclophosphazene-containing chiral ligands (6\xe2\x88\x929) with 1,1\xe2\x80\x98-binaphthyl units has been achieved by stepwise dicyclosubstitution of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (1), with two sodium cation paired dinucleophiles derived from bis-\xce\xb2-naphthol (2) and tetraethylene glycol (3). The structures of the disubstitution products have been found to be addition order-dependent. In particular, the substitution pattern of the 1,1\xe2\x80\x98-binaphthalene-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-dioxy substituent in the N3P3 ring [spiro (4 \xe2\x86\x92 6, 7) or ansa (8, 9)] was related to whether or not the crown substituent had been incorporated into 1 beforehand. Addition of the phase transfer catalyst reagent, tetrabutylammonium bromide, to the reaction mixture of 5 + 2-Na2 led to the parallel formation of both the spiro 6 and ansa 8 isomers. Spiro vs ansa regioisomerism of the binaphthalenedioxy derivatives formed is discussed in terms of the contributions of the respective thermodynamic and supramolecular effects to the regiocontrol of substitution in the N3P3 ring. It is found that there are two main factors determining the orientation of the binaphthalenedioxy substitutent incoming to the N3P3 ring:\xe2\x80\x89 the thermodynamic stability of seven-membered spirocycles at the P-atoms and the crown-related cation assistance of the ansa substitution at the macrocycle bearing P-atoms; the regiocontrol resulting from the supramolecular effects predominates, whenever possible. The structures of compounds 7\xe2\x88\x929 were proven by X-ray crystallography. The metal cation complexing properties of compounds 6\xe2\x88\x929 were compared by a simple TLC method. The results show that the complexing properties of the chiral binaphthalenedioxy-containing PNP-crown ligands 6\xe2\x88\x929 toward alkali metal and silver cations are either similar (spiro-ansa derivative 6) or enhanced (bis-ansa derivatives 7\xe2\x88\x929) with respect to the parent tetrachloro PNP-crown 5. "
"The aryl\xe2\x88\x92aryl interchange reaction of ArPdL2I complex 1m was found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics. A marked inhibition in the presence of excess phosphine and/or excess iodide was observed, suggesting that a dissociative pathway was involved, contrary to the analogous alkyl\xe2\x88\x92aryl interchange reaction studied previously. Phosphine flooding experiments could not be performed due to a competing phosphonium salt formation reaction that occurred in the presence of excess phosphine. A deuterium labeling experiment indicated that the interchange reaction proceeded via the reductive elimination to form the phosphonium salt, suggesting that excess phosphine was acting as a trap for intermediate palladium(0) species preventing the generation of the interchanged palladium(II) complex. Substituent effect studies of the interchange reaction indicated that it was inhibited by electron-withdrawing groups on both the phosphine and palladium-bound aryl groups and by increased steric bulk on both the phosphine and palladium-bound aryl groups. Under catalytic conditions, the distribution of phosphines formed from the aryl\xe2\x88\x92aryl interchange during palladium-mediated cross-coupling reactions could be modeled by statistics. Various strategies for eliminating the formation of byproducts caused by the interchange during cross-coupling reactions were screened and optimized. "
A series of functionalized and optically active major-groove polybinaphthyls and minor-groove polybinaphthyls have been synthesized by using the Suzuki coupling reaction and have been spectroscopically characterized. The application of these chiral polymers in the asymmetric addition of diethylzinc to aldehydes has been studied. A minor-groove polybinaphthyl is found to be an excellent catalyst for the asymmetric reaction of diethylzinc with a number of aldehydes. The molecular weight and the molecular weight distribution of the polymer have little effects on the catalytic process. The chiral polymer can be easily recovered and reused without loss of catalytic activity as well as enantioselectivity. These rigid and sterically regular chiral polybinaphthyls represent a new generation of enantioselective polymeric catalysts. The reaction of the polybinaphthyls as well as certain monomeric binaphthyl molecules with diethylzinc has been investigated which has provided further information on the novel polymeric catalysts. 
"Plakoside A (1a) and B (2a), two unique glycosphingolipids belonging to a new class of prenylated glycolipid, have been isolated from the marine sponge Plakortis simplex, and their structures have been determined by spectroscopic and chemical means. Plakosides are strongly immunosuppressive on activated T cells and proved to be useful natural models for an improved comprehension of the structural requirements for immunomodulating activity of glycosphingolipids.

"The SH2 domain of pp60c-src (Src), a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, facilitates signal transduction in a number of cell types through binding to cognate phosphorylated protein sequences. Phosphotyrosine-containing peptides have been shown to bind to the Src SH2 domain with micromolar affinity. Guided by the X-ray crystal structure of a phosphorylated peptide bound to the Src SH2 domain, we have designed a de novo series of small molecule ligands that bind with affinity comparable to the parent phosphopeptide. An X-ray crystal structure of the Src SH2 domain bound with a nonpeptide analog from this series verifies interactions targeted in the molecular design. However, a unique mode of binding has been revealed for the P-site phenyl phosphate group of the nonpeptide that differs from that observed for the phosphotyrosine side chain in peptide ligands bound to the Src SH2 domain. This novel binding mode is being used in guiding future design efforts. "
"1,8-Oxybis(ethyleneoxyethyleneoxy)anthracene-9,10-dione with a reduced cavity size, due to the presence of a carbonyl oxygen within the crown, has been shown by X-ray crystallography to encapsulate a hydronium ion. Hydrogen bonds between the hydronium ion and the crown oxygens are particularly strong, averaging 2.56 \xc3\x85. The polyether ring also exhibits a pronounced folding to optimize encapsulation of the hydronium ion. The hydronium hydrogen atoms have been unequivocally observed, indicating near ideal pyramidal geometry, due to the absence of hydrogen-bonding disorders previously observed in other [H3O\xc2\xb718-crown-6]+ structure analyses. Intense luminescence is concurrently observed with complexation of the hydronium ion within the polyether ring. Common oxoacids acids, such as HNO3, H2SO4, HClO4, and CF3SO3H, result in luminescent intensities approximately 40 times larger than that of 1,8-oxybis(ethyleneoxyethyleneoxy)anthracene-9,10-dione alone, which also correlates with the pKas of these acids. This capability serves a unique pKa regimen as a possible sensor molecule for measuring acidities of potent oxo and superacids. "
"Synthetic fatty acid and phosphatidylcholine amphiphiles incorporating a trans-stilbene (TS) chromophore in the fatty acid chain have been found to exhibit sharp changes in absorption and fluorescence spectra upon self-assembly in Langmuir\xe2\x88\x92Blodgett films and aqueous dispersions. The spectral changes are readily associated with aggregates in which there is a strong noncovalent interaction between the TS chromophores. In this paper, we report determination of the size, structure, and properties of these \xe2\x80\x9csupramolecular\xe2\x80\x9d aggregates using both experiments and simulations. Important findings are that the key \xe2\x80\x9cunit aggregate\xe2\x80\x9d having distinctive spectroscopic properties is a cyclic \xe2\x80\x9cpinwheel\xe2\x80\x9d tetramer characterized by strong edge\xe2\x88\x92face interactions. These tetramers may be packed together to form an extended aggregate with only small changes in absorption or fluorescence properties. While it was initially expected that aggregation occurred as a consequence of amphiphile self-assembly, studies of films of the stilbene fatty acids at the air\xe2\x88\x92water interface show the predominance of aggregate prior to compression. Similarly in phospholipid dispersions aggregates persist above temperature at which chain melting occurs. Aggregation produces strong effects on the photophysics and photochemistry of the TS chromophore. No photoisomerization occurs; however, a slow photobleaching is observed for certain assemblies which can be attributed to formation of a photodimer. Fluorescence from aggregated TS chromophores is attributed to extended aggregates and dimers (excimers), and the latter is likely responsible for the photodimerization. The supramolecular aggregates observed in this study appear quite general and closely related to those observed with a wide variety of amphiphiles incorporating aromatic chromophores. "
"Rates and products of electrophilic bromination of ring-substituted cis- and trans-stilbenes have been investigated in acetic acid, trifluoroethanol, ethanol, methanol, and water\xe2\x88\x92methanol mixtures. The mYBr relationships (linear for nucleophilic solvents only, with m = 0.8), the deviations of the two nonnucleophilic solvents from the mYBr plots (\xce\x94AcOH and \xce\x94TFE positive, negative, or negligible), the kinetic solvent isotope effects (kMeOH/kMeOD = 1.1\xe2\x88\x921.6), the chemoselectivity (predominant dibromide, DB, or solvent-incorporated adducts, MA), and the high dependence of the stereochemistry on the solvent and the substituents (from stereoconvergency to stereospecificity) are discussed and interpreted in terms of a mechanistic scheme, analogous to the Jencks scheme for aliphatic nucleophilic substitutions, in which preassociation, free-ion, and ion-pair pathways compete. In particular, the stereochemical outcome of these reactions is consistent with a marked change in the nucleophilic partners of the product-forming ionic intermediate arising from different ionization routes. Return, i.e. change in the rate-limiting step from ionization to product formation, is shown to be related to substituent-dependent, but not solvent-dependent, bromine bridging. "
"Four new fluorine-containing macrocyclic polyethers based on bis-p-phenylene-34-crown-10 have been synthesized and subsequently catenated, separately, with cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene). The efficiencies of the catenations are strongly influenced by the aromatic ring templates in the macrocyclic polyethers. Incorporation of fluorine atom substituents into one of the hydroquinone rings in bis-p-phenylene-34-crown-10 had only a small effect on the percentage yields, whereas employing bis-p-phenylene-34-crown-10 derivatives, in which both hydroquinone rings have been at least partially fluorinated, resulted in a dramatic decrease in catenation yields. In [2]catenanes incorporating macrocyclic polyethers containing one hydroquinone and one fluorinated hydroquinone ring, in both the solution (1H and 19F NMR, and UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectroscopies, electrochemical studies and molecular modeling) and solid (X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling) states, by far the major translational isomers observed were the ones with the hydroquinone ring located \xe2\x80\x9cinside\xe2\x80\x9d the cavity of the tetracationic cyclophane. The diminished strength of the noncovalent interactions arising as a result of aromatic fluorine substituents is also reflected in the rates of the movements of the two ring components (dynamic NMR spectroscopy). As well as their electron-withdrawing effect, the fluorine substituents have a pronounced effect (UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectroscopy, electrochemical studies and molecular modeling) on the geometry of the ArO\xe2\x88\x92CH2 bonds within the (fluorinated) hydroquinone rings.

"The self-assembly of four multicomponent rotaxane-like complexes, in which either (a) three or four dibenzo[24]crown-8 rings encircle threadlike oligoammonium cations [PhCH2(NH2+CH2C6H4CH2)nNH2+CH2Ph] (n = 2 or 3) to form multiply encircled pseudorotaxanes, or (b) three or four dibenzylammonium ions are threaded simultaneously through large macrocyclic polyethers, viz., tris-p-phenylene[51]crown-15 and tetrakis-p-phenylene[68]crown-20, to give multiply stranded pseudorotaxanes, is described. These supramolecular entities are created on account of stabilizing [N+H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O] and [CH\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O] hydrogen bonds, supplemented occasionally by aromatic face-to-face and edge-to-face interactions, and [CH\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7F] intermolecular bonds. Evidence for the existence of these diverse pseudorotaxane architectures in solution, in the solid state, and in some cases, in the \xe2\x80\x9cgas phase\xe2\x80\x9d, is provided by 1H NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry, respectively.

"Laccase is a multicopper oxidase which contains four coppers, one type 1, one type 2, and a coupled binuclear type 3 pair, the type 2 and type 3 copper centers together forming a trinuclear copper cluster. The type 1 mercury derivative of laccase (T1Hg Lc) has the type 1 center substituted with a redox-inactive Hg2+ ion and an intact trinuclear copper cluster. Reaction of H2O2 with fully oxidized T1Hg Lc produces a peroxide adduct which has now been studied in detail. Peroxide is shown to bind to the trinuclear cluster with low affinity, producing spectral and geometric features similar to the intermediate formed in the reduction of O2 to H2O which had been shown to have the type 2 copper reduced, the type 3 pair oxidized and antiferromagnetically coupled, and two coppers bridged at a distance of 3.4 \xc3\x85. The peroxide adduct and the intermediate have similar geometric and electronic features with the type 2 oxidized in the adduct. This center is paramagnetic and has been studied in detail. Peroxide binds to the type 2 center. EPR and ligand field (NiR MCD) coupled with CT (absorption and MCD) data demonstrate that peroxide binds to the type 2 Cu which goes from being 3-coordinate in the resting protein to 4-coordinate in the peroxide adduct. Peroxide also binds to the type 3 site from a comparison of ligand field absorption and CD and the presence of more than one intense O22- \xe2\x86\x92 Cu(II) band in the CT absorption spectrum. A bridging interaction between coppers at 3.4 \xc3\x85 is seen from the EXAFS data. Possible geometric structures for the peroxide adduct and intermediate are proposed, with the electronic structural difference between the adduct and the intermediate being related to the type 2 copper being reduced in the latter. This study (i) firmly establishes the role of the type 2 in catalysis, (ii) demonstrates a type 2/type 3 bridging mode of binding that promote further 2e- reduction of peroxide to water, and (iii) provides further support for a peroxide-level intermediate in the catalytic cycle of the multicopper oxidases which involve two 2e- steps in the reduction of O2 to H2O.

"The unusual 1,2,7-isomer of Re2Cl5(PMe3)3 (1) has been used as a starting material to prepare previously unknown dirhenium complexes. One-electron reduction of 1 by cobaltocene followed by nonredox substitution of the resulting anionic species with PMe3 led to the formation of a triply bonded 1,2,7,8-Re2Cl4(PMe3)4 (2). In the crystal structure of 2, phosphine ligands on both metal centers exhibit a cis arrangement with a P\xe2\x88\x92Re\xe2\x88\x92P angle of 93.3\xc2\xb0 in contrast to the well-known type of 1,3,6,8-isomers with a trans arrangement of the monodentate phosphines connected to each metal atom. Complex 2 represents the first example of an isomer of this type in the large M2X4(PR3)4 class of compounds (M = Re, Tc, W, Mo; X = Cl, Br, I; PR3 = monodentate phosphine). The one-electron oxidation product of 1 cocrystallized with one molecule of tetrabutylammonium chloride afforded Re2Cl6(PMe3)2 (3), for which all previous synthetic attempts had failed. This quadruply bonded complex exhibits an unusual 3-fold disorder of the Re2 unit with equal populations for all three orientations. We also report that when the \xe2\x80\x9cclassic\xe2\x80\x9d reaction of octachlorodirhenate anion, Re2Cl82-, with trimethylphosphine is carried out in benzene at room temperature the reduction processes do not occur and the product is a novel paramagnetic complex, Re2Cl6(PMe3)4 (4), which does not have a metal\xe2\x88\x92metal bond (the Re\xe2\x88\x92Re separation is 3.8476(4) \xc3\x85). Another interesting feature of compound 4 is that the PMe3 ligands have a cis disposition at each rhenium center and are located in the same plane as the metal atoms and bridging chlorine ligands. For such a ligand arrangement the molecule of 4 is the only example of a nonmetal\xe2\x88\x92metal-bonded dinuclear compound with monodentate phosphine ligands. "
"Covalently pillared layered metal phosphonate compounds were prepared by the reaction of divalent metal salts with alkylenebis(phosphonic acids). Cu(II) yields compounds Cu2[(O3PC2H4PO3)(H2O)2] (1) and Cu2[(O3PC3H6PO3)(H2O)2]\xc2\xb7H2O (2) when copper sulfate was reacted with ethylenebis(phosphonic acid) and propylenebis(phosphonic acid), respectively. The corresponding bis(phosphonates) obtained for the reaction with zinc chloride are Zn2[(O3PC2H4PO3)(H2O)2] (3) and Zn2[(O3PC3H6PO3)] (4). The structures of these four compounds were determined ab initio from their X-ray powder diffraction data and refined by Rietveld methods. Crystal data for compound 1:\xe2\x80\x89 space group P21/c, a = 8.0756(1) \xc3\x85, b = 7.5872(1) \xc3\x85, c = 7.4100(1) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 116.319(1)\xc2\xb0, Z = 2. Crystal data for compound 2:\xe2\x80\x89 space group Pnc2, a = 4.3276(2) \xc3\x85, b = 17.3181(8) \xc3\x85 c = 6.7624(3) \xc3\x85, Z = 2. Crystal data for compound 3:\xe2\x80\x89 space group P21/n, a = 5.6861(8) \xc3\x85, b = 15.230(2) \xc3\x85, c = 4.7923(6) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb2 = 91.936(2)\xc2\xb0. Crystal data for compound 4:\xe2\x80\x89 space group Pna21, a = 8.4886(6) \xc3\x85, b = 5.2720(4) \xc3\x85, c = 18.865(1) \xc3\x85, Z = 4. The metal\xe2\x88\x92oxygen bridging interactions form two-dimensional layers in all four compounds. The layers are connected to each other by the alkylene groups leading to three-dimensional structures. In the copper compounds the metal atoms are five coordinate where four of the binding sites are from the phosphonate oxygens and one from the water oxygen. The coordination geometry of the copper atoms in compounds 1 and 2 may be described as distorted square-pyramidal, but the distortion is severe in the case of compound 2. The zinc atoms in zinc ethylenebis(phosphonate) have distorted octahedral geometry. The phosphonate oxygens provide five binding sites for the metal through chelation and bridging while the water oxygen occupies the sixth coordination site. The metal atoms in compound 4, on the other hand, are tetrahedrally coordinated by the phosphonate oxygens. Unlike compounds 1\xe2\x88\x923, this compound does not contain any water molecules. The interlamellar separation is 7.2 and 7.6 \xc3\x85 for copper ethylenebis(phosphonate) and zinc ethylenebis(phosphonate), respectively. The difference in the layer separation, however, is significant in the propylenebis(phosphonates). For copper and zinc compounds the values are 8.65 and 9.4 \xc3\x85, respectively. The layer-connecting alkyl chains create open spaces whose sizes are determined by the length of the chain. Thus, a new class of pillared materials with definable cavity sizes may be prepared. "
"Stereoselective [4+2] Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder cycloadditions occur between unsaturated tertiary phosphine, phosphole, and arsine molybedenum carbonyl complexes, e.g., (Ph2E-trans-CH2CHCHCH3)Mo(CO)5 [E = P, As] and 3,4-dimethyl-1-phenylphosphole (DMPP). The coordinated DMPP undergoes a [1,5] phenyl migration at about 145 \xc2\xb0C prior to or concomitant with the [4+2] intramolecular cycloaddition reaction with the alkene moiety of the dienophile to produce a new class of conformationally rigid bidentate ligands containing the 1-phosphanorbornene bicyclic ring system. The characteristic 1H, 13C{1H}, and 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopic features of these compounds are described. Crystal structures of most of the new compounds are reported. "
"In this paper we describe polymers of two metallorotaxane systems, Rot(1,M) and Rot(2,M) (M = Zn2+ or Cu1+), which are formed by complexing a macrocyclic phenanthroline, a 5,5\xe2\x80\x98-bis([2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bithiophen]-5-yl)-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine (ligand 1) or 5,5\xe2\x80\x98-bis(3,4:3\xe2\x80\x98,4\xe2\x80\x98-bis(ethylenedioxy)[2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bithiophen]-5-yl)-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine (ligand 2), and Zn2+ or Cu1+ ions. The corresponding polymetallorotaxanes, PolyRot(1,M) and PolyRot(2,M), are produced by oxidative polymerization of Rot(1,M) and Rot(2,M). The investigations of the electrochemical, conducting, and optical properties of the metallorotaxanes and polymetallorotaxanes as well as related nonrotaxane polymers Poly(1) and Poly(2) are reported. The combined electrochemical and conductivity studies of PolyRot(1,M) and PolyRot(2,M) indicated that the polymetallorotaxane\'s redox and conducting properties were dramatically affected by the Lewis acidic and redox properties of the coordinated metal ions. The Lewis acidity produces charge localization and a redox conduction process in both polymetallorotaxane systems. The matching of the polymer and Cu1+/2+ couple redox potentials in PolyRot(2,Cu) resulted in a Cu1+/2+ contribution to conductivity. The metal-free PolyRot(1) and PolyRot(2) were produced by extracting the metal ions, and these polymers reversibly bound Zn2+ or Cu2+ ions in solution. The Cu2+ dopes the films of PolyRot(2) and Poly(2), which have lower oxidation potential than those of PolyRot(1), to produce 106\xe2\x88\x92107-fold conductivity increases. In the case of PolyRot(1) and Poly(1), the rotaxane structure was demonstrated to be key for reversible complexation of metal ions. "
"We report the synthesis, transient absorption, FT Raman, resonance Raman, time-resolved resonance Raman, and transient resonance Raman spectra of pseudo-D 2  h  symmetric [5,15-bis[(4\xe2\x80\x98-nitrophenyl)ethynyl]-10,20-diphenylporphinato]copper(II) (I) and electronically asymmetric [5-[4\xe2\x80\x98-(dimethylamino)phenyl]ethynyl]-15-[(4\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-nitrophenyl)ethynyl]-10,20-diphenylporphinato]copper(II) (II), which bears both electron-releasing and electron-withdrawing groups conjugated directly to the porphyrin periphery. The spectroscopic results suggest extensive electronic communication between the 5- and 15-arylethynyl groups and the porphyrin core. Relative to the parent compound, (tetraphenylporphinato)copper(II) (CuTPP), the arylethynyl substituents increase the lifetime of the excited trip-multiplet states. CuTPP, as well as compounds I and \t\t\t\t\t\tII, however, shows similar solvent-dependent dynamics:\xe2\x80\x89 the trip-multiplet lifetimes are longer in a noncoordinating solvent such as benzene than in a coordinating solvent such as THF. This behavior is consistent with the existence of a quenching state whose effect is more pronounced upon coordination of solvent. The time-resolved resonance Raman spectrum of compound II shows features commonly associated with the relatively long-lived triplet excited states of copper(II) porphyrins. The transient resonance Raman spectrum of a short-lived excited state present in both compounds \t\t\t\t\t\tI and II is characterized by marked shifts in the nitro and porphyrin stretching frequencies relative to that observed for the ground states of both (4-nitrophenyl)ethyne and (tetraphenylporphinato)copper(II). We interpret these results for the compounds I and \t\t\t\t\t\tII as arising from (i) a short-lived excited state present at early time that possesses enhanced porphyrin-to-nitro charge-transfer character with respect to the ground state and (ii) a longer-lived excited state deriving from this initially probed charge-transfer state that is largely porphyrin localized. \t\t\t\t\t"
"Ab initio unrestricted Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock calculations with a 6-31G* basis set were performed on 2,6-dimethylphenol (DMP or monomer) and 4-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)-2,6-dimethylphenol (dimer) to gain more insight into the mechanism of the copper-catalyzed oxidative phenol coupling reaction. Atomic charges were determined for the phenol, phenoxyl radical, phenolate anion and phenoxonium cation (both the singlet and triplet state) of both species. Calculations for the monomer show that the only aromatic carbon atom bearing a partial positive atomic charge is the para carbon of the cation in the singlet state. In the case of the dimer, the presence of a p-phenoxy substituent results in a partial positive charge for the para carbon of the first aromatic ring in all states, but this charge is significantly higher for the singlet cation. In the singlet cationic state, the para carbon of the first aromatic ring is therefore the site most susceptible to nucleophilic aromatic substitution. This result strongly supports a proposal for the mechanism of the copper-catalyzed oxidative phenol coupling, in which dinuclear phenolate-bridged copper(II) species act as intermediates affording phenoxonium cations after a double one-electron transfer. Furthermore, the charges in the second aromatic ring of the dimer are hardly, -if at all, influenced by the overall electronic state of the molecule. The charge in the first ring cannot pass the ether bond. This result, combined with the observation that the para carbon of the first aromatic ring of the singlet cation bears a large positive charge, favors a mechanism where quinone ketals are formed as intermediates during the coupling of oligomeric phenols. "
"The electrochemical reduction of tert-butyl p-cyanoperbenzoate in DMF leads to the cleavage of the oxygen\xe2\x88\x92oxygen bond. A subsequent reaction yielding tert-butyl p-cyanobenzoate could be avoided by the addition of a mild acid, with the result that the main reduction peak was affected only by the kinetics of the electron transfer bond fragmentation process. Unusual features of the heterogeneous electron transfer mechanism were evidenced by the conventional voltammetric criteria, which pointed to a nonlinear potential dependence of the transfer coefficient \xce\xb1. The fine details of the electron transfer mechanism were obtained by convolution analysis of the voltammetric curves, a procedure that led to a bell-shaped potential dependence of \xce\xb1. The observed behavior is explained by the assumption that when the electrode potential is decreased, the process changes from a concerted electron transfer bond cleavage to a partially stepwise mechanism. The observed potential dependence of \xce\xb1 is in agreement with the results from simple calculations aimed to obtain the potential dependences of \xce\xb1 expected for the two pure mechanisms. "
"The quenching of triplet C60 by phenols is greatly enhanced by addition of pyridines, which also lower the phenol voltammetric oxidation potentials. Flash photolysis shows that the products of this quenching reaction are the C60\xe2\x80\xa2- anion radical, neutral phenoxy (or naphthoxy) radicals, and protonated pyridines. Analysis of the second-order kinetics gives quenching rate constants and values of formation constants of hydrogen-bonded phenol\xe2\x88\x92pyridine pairs. The latter agree with those derived from absorption spectra over a wide range of phenols, pyridines, and solvents. Significant deuterium kinetic isotope effects are observed, indicating the importance of both proton transfer and hydrogen bonding in enhancing the rate. Quenching rates and radical yields both increase with solvent polarity. It is concluded that this quenching process involves interaction between 3C60 and a hydrogen-bonded phenol\xe2\x88\x92pyridine complex, in which electron transfer from the phenol to 3C60 is concerted with proton transfer from phenol to hydrogen-bonded pyridine.

"Picosecond time-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (PTR/CARS) is used to generate high signal to noise (S/N) vibrational spectra of bathorhodopsin (batho) formed in the photoreaction of room-temperature rhodopsin (RhRT). These PTR/CARS spectra of bathoRT, measured as a function of only the time following 3-ps (full width at half maximum), 500-nm excitation of RhRT, demonstrate that the vibrational structure of bathoRT in the 700\xe2\x88\x921700-cm-1 region is distinct from that of RhRT and remains unchanged over at least the 10 ps [8 ps cross correlation time (CCT)] to 100 ns interval of the RhRT photoreaction. Given the experimental difficulties associated with the irreversibility of the RhRT photoreaction, these are the first time-resolved vibrational spectra of bathoRT over the full 700\xe2\x88\x921700-cm-1 region to be reported. The PTR/CARS spectra taken after 100 ns contain vibrational features other than those assignable to either RhRT or bathoRT (potentially assignable to the blue-shifted intermediate, BSI). Excellent agreement is found between the major features of the RhRT and bathoRT vibrational spectra measured via PTR/CARS and earlier resonance Raman (RR) spectra taken at low temperatures (LT) selected to thermally stabilize (freeze) batho. Comparisons of the CC stretching mode region reveal a 12-cm-1 shift upon bathoRT formation (PTR/CARS data), which agrees well with the 13-cm-1 shift found for batho trapped at LT (RR data). These vibrational frequency changes also correlate well with the corresponding 38-nm (LT) and 31-nm (RT) shifts observed in the absorption maxima upon the formation of batho, thereby supporting an inverse relationship between CC frequencies and absorption maxima proposed for retinal proteins. Comparisons of the CC stretching frequencies at LT and RT reveal a temperature dependence characterized by red shifts of 4 cm-1 in Rh and 3 cm-1 in batho, the direction of which is opposite to the blue shifts observed in the visible absorption maxima of Rh (7 nm) and batho (14 nm). This latter observation suggests a stronger interaction of the protein (likely with the counterion Glu-113) with the all-trans-retinal in the bathoRT structure than in the corresponding static bathoLT structure.

"We have synthesized spin-labeled analogs of cephalosporin and penicillin and of their solvolytic methyl ester products for structural characterization by electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy. With \xce\xb2-lactamase I of Bacillus cereus 569/H/9 and the metallo-\xce\xb2-lactamase of Bacillus cereus 5/B/6, the spin-labeled penicillin and cephalosporin were shown to be as kinetically specific and catalytically active as the classical substrates benzylpenicillin and cephalosporin-C, respectively. Conformations of the spin-labeled antibiotics and of their methanolysis products have been compared on the basis of structure determination by ENDOR and molecular modeling. While the conformation of spin-labeled penicillin has been shown previously to be identical to that of amoxycillin (Mustafi, D.; Makinen, M. W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 6739\xe2\x88\x926746), the ENDOR-assigned conformation of spin-labeled cephalosporin is essentially identical to the X-ray-defined structure of cephaloglycine (Sweet, R. M.; Dahl, L. F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970, 92, 5489\xe2\x88\x925507). We have also determined by ENDOR the location of a methanol molecule that is hydrogen-bonded to the pseudopeptide NH group of the spin-labeled cephalosporin. The ENDOR results assign the location of the methanol hydroxyl group on the sterically hindered endo side of the \xce\xb2-lactam ring. This position suggests that the hydroxyl group of the methanol molecule is poised for nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the \xce\xb2-lactam ring. We have also compared the ENDOR-determined structures of the free \xce\xb2-lactam antibiotics and of their methanolysis products with the X-ray-defined structure of the benzylpenicilloyl acylenzyme intermediate of the E166N mutant of TEM-1 \xce\xb2-lactamase (Strynadka et al., Nature 1992, 359, 700\xe2\x88\x92705). The results showed that hydrolysis relieves geometrical strain in the fused \xce\xb2-lactam ring, as measured by the [N(1)\xe2\x88\x92C(6)\xe2\x88\x92C(7)\xe2\x88\x92C(8)] dihedral angle in cephalosporin or by the corresponding [N(1)\xe2\x88\x92C(5)\xe2\x88\x92C(6)\xe2\x88\x92C(7)] dihedral angle in penicillin. While the value of this dihedral angle is eclipsed at \xe2\x88\xbc0\xc2\xb0 for the intact antibiotic substrates and staggered at \xe2\x88\x9235\xc2\xb0 for the benzylpenicilloyl intermediate, the methanolysis products exhibited trans conformations at \xe2\x88\x92160\xc2\xb0. The results illustrate how hydrolysis of the \xce\xb2-lactam bond in penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotics progresses favorably from a geometrically strained to a less strained conformation in the acylenzyme reaction intermediate and finally to an inherently conformationally stable product.

"NMR relaxation parameters were measured for the peptide-plane carbonyl and nitrogen nuclei for the protein Escherichia coli flavodoxin. A poor correlation between the general order parameters of the C\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92C\xce\xb1 vector (Zeng, L.; Fischer, M. W. F.; Zuiderweg, E. R. P. J. Biomol. NMR 1996, 7, 157\xe2\x88\x92162) and the N\xe2\x88\x92NH vector was observed. We interpret this lack of correlation in this nearly spherical protein as evidence of local or semilocal anisotropic motion. A new experiment is introduced from which the cross-correlation between the carbonyl chemical shift anisotropy relaxation and carbonyl-C\xce\xb1 dipole\xe2\x88\x92dipole relaxation is obtained. We show theoretically that the three relaxation measurements, reporting on the dynamics of the C\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92C\xce\xb1 vector, N\xe2\x88\x92NH vector, and CSA tensor components behave differently under anisotropic motion. The cross-correlation order parameter formalism for dipolar cross-correlation spectral densities, as introduced by Daragan and Mayo (Daragan, V. A.; Mayo, K. H. J. Magn. Reson. B 1995, 107, 274\xe2\x88\x92278), has been extended to include cross-correlations between nonaxial chemical shift anisotropy and dipole\xe2\x88\x92dipole relaxation. By analyzing our experimental data with the theoretical models for anisotropic local motion, dynamic models were obtained for the peptide planes of 32 residues of E. coli flavodoxin. "
"A solution 1H 2D NMR investigation has been carried out on low-spin, human adult cyanomet hemoglobin (HbA) to elucidate molecular, electronic, and magnetic properties of the heme cavities in the hetero-tetrameric globin. It is shown that, in spite of its size, 65 kDa, and paramagnetism (S = 1/2), appropriately tailored 2D experiments to suppress rotating frame dipolar correlation allow detection of the scalar connectivities needed to identify heme and heme pocket residue spin topology, as well as the backbone 3J(\xce\xb1-N) necessary to assign residues sequence-specifically. NOESY rise curves clearly differentiate between primary and secondary NOEs and afford the sensitivity for providing interproton distance estimates. The combined NMR strategies provide the complete assignment of the heme, a key portion of the F-helix, the F-G turn, and residues in contact with ligands. Unambiguous subunit differentiation for all signals was achievable independently, either sequence-specifically via the Ala\xce\xb1 vs Cys\xce\xb2 at position F9 or by conserved heme C-helix contacts for Tyr\xce\xb1 vs Phe\xce\xb2 at position C7. The dipolar shifts for the assigned heme pocket residues provide the orientation of the anisotropic paramagnetic susceptibility tensor in the molecular framework, showing that the major axis in each subunit is tilted from the heme normal by \xe2\x88\xbc11\xc2\xb0 in a direction consistent with a bound cyanide exhibiting a tilt from the heme normal similar to that as observed for CO in the HbACO crystal. Numerous identified residues have been implicated in the mechanism of cooperativity. Analysis of the dipolar contacts between the heme vinyl and/or propionate groups with the adjacent heme methyls and neighboring protein residues identifies different 6-propionate mobility in the two subunits and 4-vinyl orientations with out-of-plane orientations to opposite sides of the heme in the two subunits. It is concluded that homonuclear 2D NMR is capable of providing unique information on functionally relevant structural and dynamic properties of HbA in the cyanomet form in spite of its size and paramagnetism; in fact, the paramagnetism facilitates the structural studies by significantly improving spectral resolution for the heme cavity.

"A thorough conformational search of the chromophore-forming region of immature green fluorescent protein (GFP) revealed that it is preorganized in a unique conformation required for chromophore formation. This \xe2\x80\x9ctight turn\xe2\x80\x9d conformation has an i carbonyl carbon to i + 2 amide nitrogen distance of less than 2.90 \xc3\x85 with \xcf\x86 = 60 \xc2\xb1 30\xc2\xb0 and \xcf\x88 = 30 \xc2\xb1 15\xc2\xb0. Less than 1.00% of the residues of the 50 representative proteins examined adopt this conformation. The tight turn conformation is predominately located on the periphery of the proteins or in flexible areas, except in GFP. Molecular dynamics simulations and Ramachandran plots show the chromophore-forming region in immature GFP can only adopt the tight turn conformational family. Moreover, this conformation is ideally suited for the cyclization necessary for chromophore formation, i.e., for nucleophilic attack of the amino group of Gly67 on the carbonyl group of Ser67. The 11 \xce\xb2 sheets of GFP force the chromophore-forming peptide fragment to adopt a conformation that has an exceptionally short interatomic distance between the carbonyl carbon of Ser65 and the amide nitrogen of Gly67 and lock it into this conformation. Several mutant GFPs have been expressed that exhibit greater solubility and thermostability than wild-type GFP. These properties are linked to protein folding and chromophore formation. Our calculations show that the mutations cause a shortening of the distance between the carbonyl carbon of Ser65 and the amide nitrogen of Gly67, and therefore enhance chromophore formation. "
"The development of biosensors based on genetically engineered proteins offers many potential advantages to sensors that rely on natural proteins only. Here we present how protein engineering techniques can be used to integrate optical signal transduction functions directly into proteins by incorporating environmentally sensitive fluorescent groups that are allosterically linked to a ligand binding site, using a structure-based rational design approach. The location of potential fluorescent allosteric signal transduction (FAST) sites were predicted in the periplasmic Glucose Binding Protein of Escherichia coli. Single cysteine mutations were constructed at these locations, which allowed site-specific, covalent coupling of environmentally sensitive fluorophores. The fluorescence of these conjugates was shown to be hyperbolically dependent upon glucose concentration, indicating that the behavior of the fluorophore is allosterically coupled to the degree of occupancy at the glucose binding site, as predicted. Glucose Binding Proteins with engineered FAST functions may allow the development of a new class of optical glucose sensors. "
"The quantitative and reversible compaction of open circular plasmid DNA (7676 bp) into toroids containing one to 19 molecules by sequential treatment with spermine and an excess of uranyl acetate is reported. The toroidal DNA structure was proven by cryoelectron microscopy. Linearized and supercoiled variants of the DNA also gave toroids under these conditions, but yields were significantly lower. In the presence of spermine alone no toroids were found. Open circular plasmid B-DNA helix was converted into the C-type helical form upon compaction as was shown by CD spectroscopy (negative peak at 255 nm) and electron microscopy (1.8-nm interduplex distance instead of 2.9 nm). Addition of uranyl salt to the DNA\xe2\x88\x92spermine complexes resulted in the formation of netlike assemblies which further compacted to give toroids. A model containing a hexagonal arrangement of DNA strands with extensive strand crossings is proposed. Curvature and thus toroid formation is thought to be induced by the hydrophobic DNA coating of spermine methylene groups. "
"Minute quantities of native cellular fluorophores can be quantitatively assayed using ultraviolet fluorescence detection with microcolumn separations, but spectral diversity of biological chromophores imposes serious limitations on the use of this strategy to investigate biological components. We present an approach for rapid characterization of picoliter samples containing dissimilar cellular fluorophoresincluding amino acids, monoamine neurotransmitters, flavins, and pyridine nucleotidesusing multiphoton excited fluorescence detection coupled to capillary electrophoresis separations. In this highly versatile approach, biological fluorophores are excited through the nearly simultaneous absorption of different numbers of low-energy photons. Because spectrally distinct species all can be excited with a single, long-wavelength laser source, fluorescence throughout the ultraviolet and visible regions can be detected efficiently with extremely low background. Samples containing serotonin, melatonin, FAD, and NADH can be reproducibly analyzed in 5-\xce\xbcm and 2-\xce\xbcm i.d. channels. Detection limits in 5-\xce\xbcm capillaries range from 350 zmols (38 nM) for FAD to 27 amols (1.0 \xce\xbcM) for serotonin. Use of 2-\xce\xbcm channels is shown to improve the mass detection limit for serotonin approximately as the decrease in capillary cross-sectional area (LOD \xe2\x89\x88 4 amol), and further reductions in mass detection limits are projected for analysis with even smaller diameter channels that better match the submicron size of the diffraction-limited multiphoton focal spot.

"Split-pool synthesis was used to prepare large numbers of spatially-separated molecules and thereby to investigate the specificity pockets of similar SH3 domains found in the tyrosine kinases Src and Hck. By taking into account the structure of the Src SH3 domain complexed to a ligand containing non-peptide-binding elements, the molecules were designed to complement the topography of the protein\'s binding pocket. This procedure led to the discovery of ligands having greater affinity and enhanced selectivity for the Src SH3 domain. It also yielded non-natural ligands that bind selectively to the Hck SH3 domain. Insights gained from this strategy may facilitate the discovery of molecules useful for evaluating the cellular function of SH3 domain-containing proteins. "
"Structure-based, split-pool synthesis was used to discover non-peptide binding elements for the leucine-proline binding pocket of the Src SH3 domain. Binding characteristics of the protein pocket were then explored by comparing a series of ligands that contains subtle variants of the parent non-peptide binding structure. Further insights into this receptor\xe2\x88\x92ligand interaction were provided by multidimensional NMR structure determination of one of the non-peptide ligands. "
"A novel concept of acid proliferation to improve the photosensitivity of chemically amplified photoresist materials is described by presenting the autocatalytic fragmentation of acetoacetates having a (sulfonyloxy)methyl residue to liberate the corresponding sulfonic acid. 2-Methyl-2-((methane- or p-toluenesulfonyloxy)methyl)acetoacetates were designed to be subjected to the acid-catalyzed fragmentation through the corresponding acetoacetic acids which are readily decarboxylated and undergo the subsequent \xce\xb2-elimination to give a sulfonic acid which can act as the autocatalyst to lead to the increment of acid concentration in geometric progression. Among the acetoacetates tested, tert-butyl 2-methyl-2-((p-toluenesulfonyloxy)methyl)acetoacetate was the most suitable reagent for the present purpose because of its reasonable thermal stability. A nonlinear generation of the sulfonic acid was confirmed in the acidolytic transformation of the acetoacetate in nonpolar solvents and in a film of poly[4-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)oxy)styrene] (PBOCSt), respectively. It was found that the addition of the acetoacetate to a film of PBOCSt doped with a photoacid generator enhances the photosensitivity characteristics. "
"A novel electroactive sulfydryl-specific reagent, N-(2-ferrocenylethyl)maleimide (Fc-Mi), was used to attach a redox-active reporter group to cytochrome P450cam from Pseudomonas putida. The crystal structure of the modified enzyme was determined at 2.2 \xc3\x85 resolution (Rcryst = 0.18) and compared to the structure of the wild-type enzyme complexed with its natural substrate. The results showed that two molecules of the electroactive modifier were attached to the protein. One of the ferrocenes was linked to Cys85 via the maleimide moiety and occupied the camphor-binding site in the substrate pocket. The other ferrocene was linked to Cys136 on the surface of the protein. Significant conformational changes were observed on the distal side of the heme when camphor was replaced by ferrocene. The shift in the Sor\xc3\xa9t band from 392 to 417 nm upon modification arose from the binding of a water molecule to the heme iron immediately below the ferrocene in the active site of the modified enzyme. The electrochemistry of the labeled enzyme showed clear signals originating both from the heme and from the covalently linked ferrocenes. The direct current cyclic voltammogram revealed a striking positive shift in the heme redox potential of the ferrocene-containing P450cam from \xe2\x88\x92380 mV for the camphor-bound wild-type protein to \xe2\x88\x92280 mV for the modified protein.

"The preparation and examination of 3 and 4 and their unnatural epimers 6 and 7 by following a new and alternative synthesis of 2 was conducted to assess the role of the pyrimidine C4 amine of bleomycin A2 (1) and deglycobleomycin A2 (2). The agent 3 bearing a pyrimidine C4 dimethylamino substituent exhibited a substantially diminished DNA cleavage efficiency (10\xe2\x88\x9215\xc3\x97) relative to 2 and the loss of the characteristic 5\xe2\x80\x98-GC/5\xe2\x80\x98-GT cleavage selectivity. The agent 4 in which the pyrimidine C4 amino group was removed exhibited an even greater diminished DNA cleavage efficiency (30\xc3\x97) relative to that for 2. For this agent, the characteristic cleavage selectivity is either slightly or significantly reduced depending on the assay conditions. Even in the instances where it was not substantially altered, the ability to detect it required a temperature of 4 versus 25\xe2\x88\x9237 \xc2\xb0C. This information and temperature dependence suggest a reduced binding interaction and are consistent with the participation of the pyrimidine C4 amine in one of two critical hydrogen bonds of a minor groove triplex-like recognition between the metal binding domain of 1 and 2 and guanine at the 5\xe2\x80\x98-GC/5\xe2\x80\x98-GT cleavage sites responsible for the characteristic cleavage selectivity. These observations have further implications on the potential origin of inherent 5\xe2\x80\x98-GPy > 5\xe2\x80\x98-APy cleavage selectivity of bleomycin A2 itself. This cleavage preference of 5\xe2\x80\x98-GPy > 5\xe2\x80\x98-APy may be analogously attributed to a reduced binding affinity at the 5\xe2\x80\x98-APy sites resulting from one versus two triplex-like hydrogen bonds to adenine.

Self-assembling \xe2\x80\x9csoftballs\xe2\x80\x9d are hollow pseudospherical dimers held together by hydrogen bonds in organic solvents. They encapsulate smaller molecules of suitable size and shape. Stereochemical aspects of these systems are explored through the encapsulation of camphor derivatives. Both symmetrical softballs and those rendered chiral by functional groups on the softball\'s surface are examined by 1H NMR methods. 
"Two mechanistic features of the palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation reaction of dienyl acetatesvinyl (\xcf\x80-allyl)palladium intermediate equilibration and palladium-catalyzed ionization of the bisallylic malonate productsaccount for the observed product ratios and nucleophile counterion effects. Three hexadienyl acetate substrates, isomeric with respect to the location of the leaving group to the dienyl system, were studied. The sodium, cesium, tetramethylammonium, and tetrahexylammonium salts of dimethyl malonate and dimethyl benzylmalonate were employed as nucleophiles, and both triphenylphosphine and tributylphosphine ligands were tested. The observed alkylation product ratios varied in a consistent way with the identity of the nucleophile counterion. The palladium-catalyzed ionization of bisallyl malonate products (i.e., the nucleophile serves as a leaving group for palladium ionization) was found to alter the observed product distribution only under certain circumstances such as extended reaction times or temperatures. Nucleophile crossover experiments demonstrated that the monoallylic products did not reionize or isomerize. These results are most consistent with a reaction mechanism where the vinyl (\xcf\x80-allyl)palladium(II) intermediate proximal to the leaving group is formed initially and nucleophilic addition occurs either competitive with or after complete thermodynamic equilibration of the two isomeric vinyl (\xcf\x80-allyl)palladium(II) intermediates. The observed product distribution primarily reflects the kinetic balance of these two processesnucleophilic addition and intermediate equilibration. Thus, the cesium and tetrahexylammonium counterions slow down the rate of nucleophilic addition relative to intermediate equilibration and allow the vinyl (\xcf\x80-allyl)palladium isomerization process to completely equilibrate the intermediates prior to nucleophilic addition. This effect may relate to the ability of these counterions to affect higher levels of asymmetric induction than other counterions in enantioselective alkylation reactions. "
"N-Acyl derivatives of piperazic acids display an unusual degree of conformational rigidity. As a consequence, \xce\xb1-N-coupling of a piperazic acid of given configuration (d or l) with an \xce\xb1-aminoacyl unit of opposite configuration (l or d) produces a \xe2\x80\x9cheterochiral\xe2\x80\x9d dipeptide that exists in a conformation conducive to the formation of a peptide turn. Piperazic acids and related compounds may thus be regarded as conformationally rigid analogues of proline, and because they are readily available in either antipodal form by synthesis, they should become of great interest in the study of peptide turns.

"Under the 9,10-dicyanoanthracene (DCA)-sensitized photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) conditions, 2,5-diaryl-3,3,4,4-tetradeuterio-1,5-hexadiene (d4-1) undergoes a degenerate Cope rearrangement to give a photostationary mixture of d4-1 and its 1,1,6,6-tetradeuterio analogue d4-1\xe2\x80\x98 in 52:48. This reaction involves 1,4-diaryl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteriocyclohexane-1,4-diyl cation radical (d4-2\xe2\x80\xa2+), which can be captured by molecular oxygen as 1,4-diaryl-2,3-dioxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (3). In contrast, nonphotoinduced electron-transfer (non-PET) reaction of d4-1 with cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate similarly forms d4-2\xe2\x80\xa2+, but the degenerate Cope does not take place. This observed striking contrast between PET and non-PET was ascribed to the formation of 1,4-diaryl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteriocyclohexane-1,4-diyl (d4-2) in the PET process by back-electron transfer from DCA\xe2\x80\xa2- to d4-2\xe2\x80\xa2+. The results of similar PET and non-PET reactions of 1,4-diphenyl-2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (4c) and its 5,5,6,6-tetradeuterio analogue (d4-4c) support this conclusion. Photoacoustic calorimetry of the PET reaction of 2,5-diphenyl-1,5-hexadiene (1c) suggests that 1,4-diphenylcyclohexane-1,4-diyl (2c) lies ca. 18.8 kcal/mol higher in energy than 1c and ca. 25.6 kcal/mol below the ion-radical pair [2c\xe2\x80\xa2+/DCA\xe2\x80\xa2-]. Deazetation of d4-4c demonstrates that d4-2c undergoes cleavage to d4-1c and d4-1c\xe2\x80\x98 with bond-breaking kinetic isotope effects, k(d4-2c)H4 / k(d4-2c)D4 = 1.11, completing a cation-radical cyclization\xe2\x88\x92diradical cleavage mechanism.

"Five pure 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-disubstituted meso-hydrobenzoins and one solid solution have been investigated crystallographically. The aim was to establish whether a favorable hydrogen-bonding network and aromatic herringbone packing motif might make the lamellar structure shared by meso-hydrobenzoin (mHB) and meso-hydroanisoin sufficiently robust to serve as a reliable template on which to construct isomorphous surfaces containing various functional groups. Complete structures of the 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-difluoro-, 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-dichloro-, and 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-dibromo-meso-hydrobenzoins and an average structure of the disordered 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-dimethyl derivative were determined by X-ray diffration. Partial structures of twinned or disordered crystals of the 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-diethyl derivative and of the 1:1 mixed crystal of the 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-dimethyl and 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-dibromo derivatives were determined by morphological and optical studies supplemented by diffraction. While the fluoro and ethyl compounds preserve the complete layer structure of mHB, and the bromo and chloro compounds preserve most of its features, the methyl compound packs in a completely different structure. Unlike either of its pure components, the methyl/bromo solid solution packs in the mHB layer structure. Hydrogen bonding and herringbone packing do not overwhelmingly favor a constant layer motif. Competing influences due to size, charge, and O\xe2\x88\x92H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7X hydrogen bonding (X = Cl, Br) of substituents are discussed. For crystal design purposes it is important to identify unfavorable packing motifs, such as the side-by-side arrangement of parallel C\xe2\x88\x92Cl or C\xe2\x88\x92Br groups. "
"The dinuclear complex [Co2(\xce\xbc-OH)(\xce\xbc-XDK)(bpy)2(EtOH)](NO3), where XDK is the dinucleating dicarboxylate ligand m-xylylenediamine bis(Kemp\'s triacid imide) and bpy = 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine, was prepared as a functional model for arginase. The substrate aminoguanidinium nitrate was hydrolyzed to urea in ethanol by the complex but not by free hydroxide ion under the same conditions. The amino group of the substrate binds to cobalt, as demonstrated by UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectroscopic studies. The syntheses of related dinuclear cobalt(II) complexes [Co2(\xce\xbc-XDK)(NO3)2(CH3OH)2(H2O)], [Co2(\xce\xbc-Cl)(\xce\xbc-XDK)(bpy)2(EtOH)2](NO3), and [Co2(\xce\xbc-XDK)(py)3(NO3)2] are described. Mononuclear complexes [Co(XDK)(bpy)(H2O)] and [Zn(XDK)(bpy)(H2O)] were also prepared and characterized. The former catalytically hydrolyzes aminoguanidinium nitrate to urea in basic 1:1 methanol/water solutions, whereas the latter does not promote this reaction. Hydrolysis of aminoguanidinium ion is effected by [Co(CH3COO)2] and [Cu(CH3COO)2] in the presence of bpy, but not by [Zn(CH3COO)2], [Ni(CH3COO)2], or [Mn(CH3COO)2] in the presence of bpy in 1:1 methanol/water solution. In all cases, coordination of the amino group of the substrate to the metal center under the reaction conditions may activate the leaving group and orient the guanidinium moiety close to the attacking nucleophile, metal-bound hydroxide ion, to promote the hydrolysis reaction.

"Thermolysis of a xylene solution of Cp2Fe2(CO)4 and PPh3 yields primarily Cp4Fe4(CO)4 (1) together with smaller amounts of (C5H4Ph)Cp3Fe4(CO)4 and Cp3Fe3(CO)3(PPh2). Cluster 1 can be alkylated and arylated by using organolithium reagents to give the derivatives (C5H4R)Cp3Fe4(CO)4. This reaction is competitive with reduction of 1 by the organolithium reagent. A more versatile method for functionalizing 1 involves its deprotonation with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) followed by treatment with electrophiles to give (C5H4X)Cp3Fe4(CO)4 (X = C(OH)HCH3, CO2H, CHO, SPh, PPh2). An excess of LDA gave increased amounts of the di- and even trifunctionalized derivatives (C5H4X)xCp4-xFe4(CO)4 (x = 2, 3). Treatment of (C5H4CHO)Cp3Fe4(CO)4 with the lithiated cluster gave the double cluster [(C5H4)Cp3Fe4(CO)4]2CHOH. The use of the cluster as a ligand was demonstrated by the synthesis of the adducts (C5H4PPh2MLn)Cp3Fe4(CO)4, where MLn = RuCl2(cymene), IrCl(1,5-C8H12). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was employed to characterize [(C5H4)Cp3Fe4(CO)4]2CHOH and (C3H4PPh2)Cp3Fe4(CO)4RuCl2(cymene). "

"Selective hydrogenolysis of Sn(n-C4H9)4 on a Pt/SiO2 catalyst has been carried out at various temperatures and coverages of the metallic surface to prepare via surface organometallic chemistry a well-defined class of bimetallic catalysts. The stoichiometry and kinetics of the reaction was followed by the careful analysis of reagents and products, including extraction of unreacted reagents, and elemental analysis of the samples. The various surface species formed were characterized by electron microscopy (CTEM and TEM EDAX) and EXAFS analysis. Possible structures of the surface organometallic fragments were considered using molecular modeling. At 50 \xc2\xb0C, the hydrogenolysis reaction occurs selectively on the platinum surface with exclusive evolution of n-butane. There is first formation of a Sn(n-C4H9)3 fragment grafted on the platinum particle which undergoes a stepwise cleavage of two tin\xe2\x88\x92carbon \xcf\x83-bonds to form a stable Pt\xe2\x88\x92Sn(n-C4H9) fragment. Regardless of the reaction time, surface coverage, or loading, the number of grafted butyl fragments per platinum is never greater than unity, that is to say that when Sn(n-C4H9)3 is formed the platinum coverage by tin is 0.3 whereas when Sn(n-C4H9) is formed the platinum coverage is closer to 1. It is therefore suggested that the surface composition is governed by the bulkiness of the alkyl chains which are \xe2\x80\x9cclose packed\xe2\x80\x9d on the surface. At 100 \xc2\xb0C, the reaction takes place both on the platinum and the silica surface. On the platinum surface, the same fragments (namely Sn(n-C4H9)3, Sn(n-C4H9)2, and Sn(n-C4H9)) were identified, but simultaneously on the silica surface, the well-described \xe2\x8b\xaeSiOSn(n-C4H9)3 species was also formed. Thermal treatment under hydrogen of Pts\xe2\x88\x92Sn(n-C4H9) lead to alkyl-free tin atoms which are located at the periphery of the particle as evidenced by Sn K edge EXAFS (Pt\xe2\x88\x92Sn distance of 2.75 \xc3\x85 with a coordination number of ca. 4). Even if the organotin fragments are grafted with a coverage of unity, after their complete hydrogenolysis at 300 \xc2\xb0C, about 40% of the platinum is still accessible to H2 chemisorption. This could be explained by the increase of the particle diameter (+0.5 \xc3\x85) which prevents a close packing of the tin atoms around the particle and leaves some platinum atoms still accessible to the hydrogen. After treatment of the catalyst at higher temperatures, typically 500 \xc2\xb0C, the structure of the catalyst is slightly changed since the tin atoms migrate into the first monolayer of the particle, as evidenced by a significant increase of the tin coordination number (ca. 4.4\xe2\x88\x925.6) as determined by EXAFS. Hypothetical surface structures have been proposed on the basis of molecular modeling of platinum particles covered by various surface organotin fragments. "
"Okadaic acid (1) is a polyether compound produced by the marine dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima. Its biosynthesis attracts considerable attention since the carbon skeleton has been shown to be synthesized via an unusual route. However, a very limited amount of information is available for the formation of its ether rings. We applied collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (CID MS/MS) to the elucidation of the 18O-incorporation pattern of okadaic acid. The extensive determination of 18O/16O ratios for each product ion bearing differing numbers of incorporated 18O atoms resulted in the complete assignment of the labeled positions with accurate isotope ratios; the positions labeled from molecular oxygen (18O2) were O(1)/O(2), O(3), O(5), O(6), O(8), O(9), O(10), and O(12). Those labeled from [18O2]acetate were O(4), O(6), O(7), and O(11) (oxygen atoms are numbered beginning with those of carboxylic acid as O(1)/O(2) to O(13) in ring G). These incorporation patterns suggest that the cyclization of ether rings C, D, and E occurs via a \xce\xb2-epoxide intermediate at C22\xe2\x88\x92C23, and the carboxylic acid is formed by Baeyer\xe2\x88\x92Villiger oxidation.

"The rearrangement\xe2\x88\x92dissociation mechanisms of ionized cyclopropylamine have been studied with tandem mass spectrometry, photoion\xe2\x88\x92photoelectron coincidence spectroscopy, and (PU)MP4SDTQ/6-311G**//MP2/6-31G*+ZPE molecular orbital calculations. The present investigation demonstrates that the cyclic structure of cyclopropylamine is not preserved after electron removal; in fact, photon or electron ionization leads to a more stable open form, [CH2CH2CHNH2]\xe2\x80\xa2+, 2, which belongs to the category of distonic ions. Dissociative ionization of cyclopropylamine leads essentially to H atom loss. Experiments demonstrate that (i) the dissociation threshold is compatible only with the [CH2CHCHNH2]+ fragment ion structure, (ii) the hydrogen expelled from ions of low internal energy comes exclusively from a carbon, and (iii) the dissociation rate exhibits a very slow rise with internal energy. Molecular orbital calculations predict that the lowest energy pathway involves isomerization of 2 into ionized 1-aminopropene, [CH3CHCHNH2]\xe2\x80\xa2+, 3. The degenerate 1,2-HCNH2 shift [CH2CH2CHNH2]\xe2\x80\xa2+, 2 \xe2\x87\x84 [NH2CHCH2CH2]\xe2\x80\xa2+, 2, is found to require a negligible critical energy. A statistical (RRKM) modeling of the reaction rate accurately reproduces the experimental data, and the observed slow down effect on the dissociation rate appears to be due to the passage through the very stable structure 3. Several previously unknown thermochemical parameters, including the standard heat of formation of various neutral and ionized (C3, H7, N) species, are proposed; for example \xce\x94fH\xc2\xb0300[CH2CH2CHNH2]\xe2\x80\xa2+ = 840 \xc2\xb1 10 kJ/mol and \xce\x94fH\xc2\xb0300[CH3CHCHNH2]\xe2\x80\xa2+ = 770 \xc2\xb1 10 kJ/mol are deduced from a combination of experiment and theory.

"Distributions of five metal cations (Na+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, Zn2+) and water around a phosphate group with charge \xe2\x88\x921 compiled from crystal structures showed that these species prefer to bind in sterically well-defined and distinct positions. The differences between the stereochemistry of binding of these metal cations may be related to the different effects they have on thermodynamic properties and conformational equilibria of DNA. All the studied cations prefer asymmetric monodentate positions where they bind to only one of the two charged oxygens (OP) while the bidentate site located symmetrically between the two OP atoms is not occupied at all. Mg2+ and Zn2+ have just one binding site, Na+ has two sites, and K+ and water have three sites. Water distributions from Na+, Mg2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+ phosphate salts resemble each other but they are modified by the distribution of the accompanying metal. The Mg2+ and Zn2+ distributions are spatially most constrained and have the smallest volumes. The distributions of K+ and water have up to eight times and that of Na+ four times larger volume. The cation and water distributions were analyzed from 18 (9, 9, 6, 12) crystal structures of Na+ (Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, and Zn2+) salts of organic phosphates (charge \xe2\x88\x921, R-factor of 10% or better, deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database) by a Fourier averaging technique described elsewhere (Schneider et al:\xe2\x80\x89 Biophys. J. 1993, 64, 2291). "
"High-level ab initio molecular orbital and density functional theory calculations incorporating cavity polarity effects via the use of self-consistent reaction field (SCIPCM) simulations reveal that the short, strong hydrogen bond formed between a formic acid molecule and a formate anion is significantly, but nowhere near completely, weakened by the presence of an extremely polar cavity. These results suggest that even if an enzyme active site were to present an environment as polar as aqueous water, the formation of a low-barrier, or short-strong, hydrogen bond would still be some 8 kcal/mol more favorable than the corresponding neutral, traditional, weak hydrogen bondlike the one formed between two formic acid molecules. The short, strong hydrogen bond formed between a formic acid and a formate anion is clearly much more sensitive to the effects of its environment than is a typical weak traditional hydrogen bond. However, even in the most polar of cavities, the calculated hydrogen bond energy for formic acid\xe2\x88\x92formate anion is greater than 12 kcal/mol, whereas the calculated hydrogen bond energy for formic acid\xe2\x88\x92formic acid is less than 4 kcal/mol. These results suggest that cavity polarity effects alone are insufficient grounds to rule out the low-barrier hydrogen bond facilitated mechanism, as proposed by Gerlt, Gassman, Cleland, and Kreevoy several years ago.

"13C relaxation data obtained at different field strengths are reported for the osmoregulated periplasmic glucan (OPG) of Ralstonia solanacearum. Previous studies on this molecule showed that it is composed of 13 glucose units, linked all but one via \xce\xb2-(1\xe2\x88\x922) (Talaga et al. J. Bacteriol. 1996, 178, 2263\xe2\x88\x922271). The single \xce\xb1-(1\xe2\x88\x926) linkage induces structural constraints to such an extent that all individual anomeric proton resonances could be distinguished, opening the possibility of a genuine structure determination of this molecule. The relaxation data in this report agree well with the dynamical data extracted from the off-resonance ROESY experiments (Lippens et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 7019\xe2\x88\x927027), but indicate as well an important exchange contribution to the T2 relaxation times. This latter event was shown to result from a large-scale motion on the microsecond time scale, especially affecting the residues downstream of the \xce\xb1-(1\xe2\x88\x926) linkage. Future atomic models of the compound will have to take into account the presence of conformational exchange. "
"Multilayer formation between organic dyes and polyions is complicated by the possible competition between dye extraction from the surface by the polymer solution instead of polymer adsorption. We study the effects of salt concentration (NaCl, Na2SO4, MgCl2, and MgSO4) on this process and note that significant fractions of the dye are removed from the surface at intermediate salt concentration but that at lower or higher salt concentration less surface dye extraction occurs. Polymer solutions with intermediate NaCl concentrations show more than 60% dye extraction, while those of MgCl2, Na2SO4, and MgSO4 show approximately 30%, 25%, and 20% dye extraction, respectively. The maximum in dye extraction for all of these salts occurs when the solution Debye length is approximately 2 \xc3\x85. The reduced efficiency of dye complexation away from the maximum is interpreted in terms of the polymer\'s expected increase in persistence length (low salt concentration) and the reduced electrostatic interactions between the charged dye and polymer (high salt concentration). The absorbance of poly(styrenesulfonate) remains roughly constant or slightly increases for the 1:1 and 2:2 salts but decreases with increasing 2:1 salt concentration. We propose that this decrease is due to charge reversal on the polymer or surface by the salt. Small shifts in dye peak positions suggest changes in the polarity of the surrounding matrix. "
"The energetics of the acylation step of AChE (acetylcholinesterase) is explored by using molecular simulation approaches. These include the evaluation of activation free energies by using the empirical valence bond (EVB) potential surface and an all-atom free energy perturbation (FEP) approach, as well as estimates of the catalytic effect of the enzyme by using the semimicroscopic version of the Protein Dipoles Langevin Dipoles (PDLD/S) method. The determination of the effect of the enzyme is based on the use of reliable experimental information in evaluating the energetics of the reference reaction in water and then on using robust simulations for the evaluation of the effect of moving the reacting system from a solvent cage to the protein active site. This procedure reduces the error range of the overall analysis since the energetics in water is not evaluated by a first principle approach. The use of two simulation methods and different initial conditions provide a way for assessing the error range of the calculations and the validity of the corresponding conclusions. Both the EVB and PDLD/S approaches show that the enzyme reduces the activation barrier of the acylation step by 10\xe2\x88\x9215 kcal/mol relative to the corresponding reference reaction in water. This corresponds to a (107\xe2\x88\x921011)-fold rate acceleration, which is in good agreement with the corresponding experimental estimate. The origin of the catalytic power of the enzyme appears to be associated with electrostatic stabilization of the transition state. This electrostatic effect can be classified as a combination of reduction of the energy of the charged intermediate and reduction in the reorganization energy. The contributions of different protein residues to the stabilization of the transition state are estimated. It is demonstrated that, in contrast to some proposals, AChE and other enzymes do not work by providing a hydrophobic environment but rather a polar environment. This work concludes that the most important catalytic effects are associated with nearby residues rather than distant ionized residues. It is also concluded that the enzyme has evolved first to optimize the speed of the actual bond breaking/bond making chemical processes and only then to fine-tune the rate by optimizing the barrier for the diffusion step. Since the optimization of the chemical step involves more than 10 kcal/mol and the optimization of the diffusion step involves at most 1 or 2 kcal/mol, it appears that the possible acceleration of the diffusion step is a second-order effect. These conclusions are consistent with the available experimental studies. "
"Results pertaining to the direct and indirect electrochemistry of 5,7-di-tert-butylspiro[2.5]octa-4,7-dien-6-one (1a), 1-methyl-5,7-di-tert-butylspiro[2.5]octa-4,7-dien-6-one (1b), and 1,1,-dimethyl-5,7-di-tert-butylspiro[2.5]octa-4,7-dien-6-one (1c) are reported. Product analyses reveal that reduction of all these substrates leads to cyclopropane ring-opened products; ring opening occurs with modest selectivity leading to the more substituted (stable) distonic radical anion. The direct electrochemistry of these compounds is characterized by rate limiting electron transfer (with \xce\xb1 \xe2\x89\x88 0.5), suggesting that while ring opening is extremely rapid, the radical anions do have a discrete lifetime (i.e., electron transfer and ring opening are not concerted). Utilizing homogeneous redox catalysis, rate constants for electron transfer between 1a, 1b, and 1c and a series of aromatic radical anions were measured; reduction potentials and reorganization energies were derived from these rate constants by using Marcus theory.

A self-assembled monolayer on a planar gold substrate has been used to initiate the living cationic ring-opening polymerization of 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline. The polymer chain end was functionalized with an alkyl moiety by means of the termination reaction in order to form an amphiphilic brush-type layer. The resulting layer (d \xe2\x88\xbc 10 nm) of linear poly(N-propionylethylenimine) (PPEI) is of uniform thickness and was found to be very stable. 
"Ni(II) chelated peptides of the form NH2-Xaa-Xaa-His-CONH2 (Ni(II)\xc2\xb7Xaa-Xaa-His) mediate deoxyribose damage through C4\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92H abstraction of a targeted nucleotide when activated with KHSO5 (oxone), MMPP (magnesium monoperoxyphthalate), or H2O2. The products released and identified in comparison to the authentic C4\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92H oxidant Fe(II)\xc2\xb7bleomycin included fragmented DNA terminating in 5\xe2\x80\x98-phosphates, 3\xe2\x80\x98-phosphates, and 3\xe2\x80\x98-phosphoglycolates; upon treatment of Ni(II)\xc2\xb7Xaa-Xaa-His cleavage reactions with NaOH or NH2NH2, fragmented DNA 3\xe2\x80\x98-termini were released consistent with the intermediate formation of keto-aldehyde abasic (alkaline-labile) sites. In addition, nucleobases and nucleobase propenals were detected in proportions consistent with abasic site and 3\xe2\x80\x98-phosphoglycolate termini formation, respectively. These results indicate that Ni(II)\xc2\xb7Xaa-Xaa-His metallopeptides, like Fe(II)\xc2\xb7bleomycin, degrade DNA through two pathways resulting from an initial C4\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92H modification. Importantly, the partitioning between these two pathways appears to be dependent on the structure of the Ni(II)\xc2\xb7Xaa-Xaa-His metallopeptide employed in the cleavage reaction and the nucleotide sequence targeted. Further studies also indicate that metallopeptide activation with KHSO5, MMPP, or H2O2 yields identical reaction products and sequence-selective DNA cleavage suggesting the formation of a common \xe2\x80\x9cactivated\xe2\x80\x9d metallopeptide responsible for C4\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92H deoxyribose damage, quite possibly a metal-bound hydroxyl radical. These studies also demonstrate that metallopeptide activation with KHSO5 is condition-dependent resulting in (1) C4\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x88\x92H damage in common with MMPP or H2O2 under relatively \xe2\x80\x9clow\xe2\x80\x9d ionic strength conditions (10 mM Na-cacodylate, pH 7.5, equimolar KHSO5/metallopeptide) or (2) guanine nucleobase oxidation under higher ionic strength conditions (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM phosphate, pH 7.0, excess KHSO5).

"Chymotrypsin and subtilisin BPN\xe2\x80\x98 can be inhibited by bis(4-nitrophenyl) methylphosphonate (NMN) and bis(4-nitrophenyl) propylphosphonate (NPN) very efficiently with second-order rate constants, ki/Ki, between 544 and 4300 M-1 s-1 at 25.0 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc2\xb0C at the pH maxima. The second-order rate constants for the inhibition of trypsin are 26.3 \xc2\xb1 1.4 M-1 s-1 with NMN and 891 \xc2\xb1 14 M-1 s-1 with NPN at pH 8.3 and 25.0 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc2\xb0C. A second stoichiometric equivalent 4-nitrophenol is also lost from 4-nitrophenyl alkylphosphonyl adducts of chymotrypsin but not from trypsin and subtilisin BPN\xe2\x80\x98. Elimination of 4-nitrophenol from the propylphosphonyl adduct is at a rate only about twice the rate of hydrolysis of a comparable phosphonate diester, whereas 4-nitrophenol is eliminated 270 times faster from the methylphosphonyl adduct of chymotrypsin. The activation enthalpies, in kcal/mol, for 4-nitrophenol elimination from 4-nitrophenyl alkylphosphonylchymotrypsin are 15.0 \xc2\xb1 1.3 for the propyl derivative, 16.4 \xc2\xb1 0.5 for the methyl derivative in H2O and 18.0 \xc2\xb1 0.5 in D2O. The activation entropies, in cal mol-1 K-1, are \xe2\x88\x9229.7 \xc2\xb1 2.4 for the propyl derivative, \xe2\x88\x9214.8 \xc2\xb1 0.5 for the methyl derivative in H2O, and \xe2\x88\x9210.3 \xc2\xb1 0.3 for the methyl derivative in D2O. Partial solvent isotope effects for the elimination of 4-nitrophenol from 4-nitrophenyl methylphosphonylchymotrypsin give best fits to two-site proton models:\xe2\x80\x89 These give primary isotope effects between 1.9 and 2.0 (\xcf\x861\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 0.52 \xc2\xb1 0.14 or 0.49 \xc2\xb1 0.07) for a proton in flight, possibly from the water attacking at phosphorus to the catalytic His, and an \xce\xb1-secondary effect of 1.3 (\xcf\x862\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 0.75 \xc2\xb1 0.20) or a term for solvent contribution of 1.25 (\xce\xa6 = 0.80 \xc2\xb1 0.10). The secondary \xce\xb2-deuterium isotope effect on the elimination of the second 4-nitrophenol from the adduct of chymotrypsin with NMN-l3 (l = h or d) is 0.94 \xc2\xb1 0.2 possibly of hyperconjugative origin. The occurrence and mechanisms of secondary reactions in phosphonylated serine protease enzymes are markedly different from those in phosphonylated cholinesterases. "
"Nonracemic helicene 1 when cooled from the melt organizes itself into macroscopic liquid crystalline fibers. Transmission electron microscopic analysis shows that the fibers are comprised of lamellae 50\xe2\x88\x92200 nm wide, each only ca. 10 nm high. Analyses by X-ray and electron diffraction demonstrate that the molecules are organized in hexagonally packed columns. Polarized light microscopy reveals that the columns are stacked so that their long axes parallel the long axes of the fibers. In ultrathin films, the alkyl side chains organize themselves further as in crystalline alkanes. "
"As part of the quest for antisense compounds with relative to DNA and RNA improved nuclease-resistance and favorable RNA hybridization properties, a large variety of oligonucleotide analogues has been generated in recent years. Among these, the oligonucleotide N3\xe2\x80\x98 \xe2\x86\x92 P5\xe2\x80\x98 phosphoramidate DNA (3\xe2\x80\x98-NP DNA), an analogue with the 3\xe2\x80\x98-oxygen in the nucleic acid sugar\xe2\x88\x92phosphodiester backbone replaced by an amino group, displays several unique features. Self-pairing of 3\xe2\x80\x98-NP DNA single strands is significantly favored thermodynamically over self-pairing of both DNA and RNA (Gryaznov, S. M.; et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995, 92, 5798\xe2\x88\x925802). CD measurements in solution have shown that the duplex conformation of 3\xe2\x80\x98-NP DNA is very similar to the RNA A-form. Moreover, 3\xe2\x80\x98-NP DNA can form stable triplexes with double-stranded DNA under conditions where native DNA fails to do so. Recently, it was shown that all-phosphoramidate DNA analogues of HIV-1 RRE and TAR RNA specifically bind to the RNA-binding Rev- and Tat-related peptides (Rigl, C. T.; et al. Biochemistry 1997, 36, 650\xe2\x88\x92659). We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of the all-modified 3\xe2\x80\x98-NP DNA duplex [5\xe2\x80\x98-d(CnpGnpCnpGnpAnpAnpTnpTnpCnpGnpCnpG)]2 at 2-\xc3\x85 resolution. Whereas the Dickerson\xe2\x88\x92Drew type phosphodiester DNA 5\xe2\x80\x98-d(CGCGAATTCGCG) adopts a B-form duplex in the crystal as well as in solution, the 3\xe2\x80\x98-NP DNA duplex with identical sequence displays an A-RNA conformation in the crystal. Combined with the earlier CD results in solution, our observation provides convincing evidence that the A-conformation with 3\xe2\x80\x98-NP DNA is modification- and not sequence-induced. The crystal structure reveals a dramatically improved hydration of the phosphoramidate DNA relative to DNA due to the presence of the amino group in its sugar\xe2\x88\x92phosphate backbone. Compared with A-DNA and A-RNA, the 3\xe2\x80\x98-NP DNA duplex geometry appears more uniform, with backbone torsion angles of individual nucleotides displaying only minor variations. This is consistent with an observed repetitive pattern of coordination by either chloride anions or water molecules to the 3\xe2\x80\x98-amino groups in the crystal, suggesting a strong anomeric effect between the 3\xe2\x80\x98-nitrogen lone electron pair and the \xcf\x83* orbital of the P\xe2\x88\x92O5\xe2\x80\x98 bond. Our crystal structure can qualitatively explain the exceptional thermodynamic stability of 3\xe2\x80\x98-NP DNA, and helps to rationalize previously ill understood findings, such as the surprising fact that DNA with NH substituted for O5\xe2\x80\x98 fails to pair with either DNA or RNA. The crystal structure also establishes 3\xe2\x80\x98-NP DNA as the quintessential RNA mimetic, in terms of overall duplex structure, rigidity, and level of hydration. "
"A detailed study of the competition between C\xe2\x88\x92C, C\xe2\x88\x92H, and C\xe2\x88\x92Si bond fragmentation in a series of 4-methoxy-\xce\xb1-substituted toluene radical cations (1\xe2\x80\xa2+), involving both product studies and kinetic analysis, is presented. C\xe2\x88\x92C bond fragmentation occurs with several radical cations in acetonitrile. The rate constants for such processes, determined by laser flash photolysis, varied from 2.8 \xc3\x97 104 (1c\xe2\x80\xa2+) to 1.53 \xc3\x97 106 (1f\xe2\x80\xa2+) s-1. The activation parameters for C\xe2\x88\x92C bond fragmentation are characterized by low activation enthalpies on the order of 30 kJ mol-1 and negative activation entropies in the range \xe2\x88\x9234 to \xe2\x88\x9255 J mol-1 K-1. Deprotonation of the radical cations is always a second-order process induced by nucleophiles [cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) or nitrate anion], with second-order rate constants from 7.7 \xc3\x97 107 (1h\xe2\x80\xa2+) to 8.8 \xc3\x97 108 (1i\xe2\x80\xa2+) M-1 s-1 in neat acetonitrile (CAN assisted) and from 0.4 \xc3\x97 108 (1j\xe2\x80\xa2+) to 7.1 \xc3\x97 108 (1i\xe2\x80\xa2+) M-1 s-1 in the presence of nitrate anion. The rate constant for nitrate-induced decarboxylation was higher, 13.6 \xc3\x97 108 M-1 s-1 (1d\xe2\x80\xa2+). In a few cases C\xe2\x88\x92C (1e\xe2\x80\xa2+, 1f\xe2\x80\xa2+) and C\xe2\x88\x92Si (1g\xe2\x80\xa2+) fragmentations occurred, also as second-order processes induced by nitrate, with rate constants from 4.4 \xc3\x97 108 (1f\xe2\x80\xa2+) to 8.2 \xc3\x97 108 (1g\xe2\x80\xa2+) M-1 s-1. \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 had opposing influences on C\xe2\x88\x92H and C\xe2\x88\x92C fragmentation, and in the case of 1e\xe2\x80\xa2+ a temperature-dependent product distribution was obtained. The activation parameters for the observed C\xe2\x88\x92H, C\xe2\x88\x92C, and C\xe2\x88\x92Si fragmentations have been compared, and suggest a rationale for the mechanisms and selectivity of such processes in radical cations.

"Delocalized radical cations having two nitrogen-centered charge bearing units bridged by \xcf\x80 systems may be considered Class III intervalence compounds. The transition energy of the longest wavelength band may therefore be equated with the Eop of Hush theory, which is twice the electronic interaction matrix element V. The optically estimated value of V (Vop = Eop/2) drops significantly (6.0 kcal/mol) when the methyl groups of tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine radical cation (1+, Vop = 23.3 kcal/mol) are replaced by phenyl groups in the tetraphenyl compound (3+) and detectably (0.6 kcal/mol) when they are replaced by bicyclic alkyl groups in bis(9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]non-9-yl)-p-phenylenediamine (4+). The Vop values observed for n bonds connecting the nitrogens follow the relationship V = V0 exp(\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb2n(n\xe2\x88\x921)/2) rather well for dinitrogen (n = 3), p-phenylene (n = 5), and biphenylene (n = 9) bridges with \xce\xb2n \xe2\x88\xbc 0.3. AM1-NCG calculations are fairly successful at predicting changes in Eop for these compounds and 1,5-dimethyl-1,5-dihydrophenazine radical cation (8+) but fail totally for methylviologen radical cation (10+). AM1 calculations predict [Me2N(CHCH)yNMe2]+ to localize at y = 6 and [Me2N(C\xe2\x8b\xaeC)yNMe2]+ at y = 5, and in both cases calculated V drops below calculated \xce\xbb/2, as expected. V values for nitrogen-centered and transition metal-centered intervalence compounds are compared. Significantly larger V values for the nitrogen-centered examples cause charge delocalization to occur for larger \xcf\x80 systems than for transition metal-centered examples. "
"The complex Cu(I)Cl/4,4\xe2\x80\x98-dinonyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine (bpy9) catalyzes via a redox process the homogeneous \xe2\x80\x9cliving\xe2\x80\x9d radical polymerization of styrene(s), methacrylates, and acrylates initiated with a variety of functional phenylsulfonyl chlorides. Polymers with narrow molecular weight distribution and molecular weights close to the theoretical ones are obtained from these three classes of monomers. Kinetics of propagation and initiation were performed with selected substituted phenylsulfonyl chlorides and with their monoadducts to monomer. Polymerizations follow first-order kinetics internally in monomer and externally in Cu(I)Cl while initiation is first order internally in initiator and in Cu(I)Cl concentrations. A catalyst concentration dependence of the optimum bpy9/Cu(I)Cl ratio which yields the largest rate constant of polymerization was observed. The apparent rate constants of propagation corrected for catalyst concentration are in the order:\xe2\x80\x89 methacrylates > styrene > acrylates. This inversion from the classic dependence of the corresponding absolute rate constants (acrylates > methacrylates > styrene) was shown to be determined by a different steady-state concentration of propagating radicals which is in dynamic equilibrium with an extremely large excess of the corresponding dormant C\xe2\x88\x92Cl species. The formation and the concentration of the radical species is determined by the C\xe2\x88\x92Cl bond strength of the dormant species. Apparent rate constants of initiation corrected for catalyst concentration are in the order:\xe2\x80\x89 styrene > methacrylates > acrylates. Within experimental error, initiation efficiency is 100% and the apparent rate constants of initiation are 4 (for styrene and methacrylates) and 3 or 2 (for acrylates) orders of magnitude higher than those of propagation. The absence of conjugation between the sulfonyl radical and its phenyl group generates a small effect of the phenyl group substituent on the rate constant of initiation. These results demonstrate that arenesulfonyl chlorides are the first class of universal functional initiators for the metal-catalyzed \xe2\x80\x9cliving\xe2\x80\x9d radical polymerization of styrene(s), methacrylates, and acrylates. This discovery provides numerous fundamental and technological opportunities in the field of controlled radical polymerization and copolymerization, of well-defined functional polymers and copolymers with complex architecture, and of self-organized supramolecular systems based on them.

"The synthesis, structure, conformation, and dynamics of a new rotane family consisting of four-membered rings are described. All syntheses are based on bicyclobutylidene (9):\xe2\x80\x89 [2+1] cycloaddition of cyclobutylidene yields [3.4]rotane (5) (9\xe2\x88\x925), [2+2] cycloaddition of trimethyleneketene followed by spiroalkylation of the resulting trispiroketone 10 yields [4.4]rotane (6) (9\xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x88\x9213\xe2\x88\x9214\xe2\x88\x926), homologization of 10 via \xce\xb2-hydroxy selenides gives access to tetraspiroketone 11 and pentaspiroketone 12 (10\xe2\x88\x9215\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x88\x9216\xe2\x88\x9212), and further elaboration directed toward a cyclopropylcarbene\xe2\x88\x92cyclobutene rearrangement yields [5.4]rotane (7) and [6.4]rotane (8) [11(12)\xe2\x88\x9218(24)\xe2\x88\x9219(25)\xe2\x88\x9220(26)\xe2\x88\x9221(27)\xe2\x88\x9222(28)\xe2\x88\x9223(29)\xe2\x88\x927(8)]. The structures of 6, 7, and 8 were determined by high-precision low-temperature X-ray analyses and by force field calculations using the search routine HUNTER in connection with MM3(92). The following special features were observed:\xe2\x80\x89 From 5 to 8, the bond angles of the central ring increase while the bond angles at the spiro center of the spiroannelated cyclobutane rings decrease. As a consequence, the cyclobutane rings change their geometry from a regular trapezoid in 6 to a kite with the smallest angle at the spiro center in 7 and 8. At the same time their folding decreases, until in 8 they are close to planar. At room temperature, all hexaspiranes (8, 25\xe2\x88\x9229) are conformationally stable. This phenomenon allowed a stereoselective synthesis of axially labeled [1-13C]8\' and, via a high-temperature equilibration with equatorially labeled [1-13C]8, a determination of the free energy of activation for the chair to chair interconversion as \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7487 = 156.8 \xc2\xb1 1.1 kJ/mol. This is the highest barrier of inversion ever reported for a cyclohexane. Promising candidates for even higher barriers are [6.5]rotane (32) and [6.6]rotane (33). "
"A novel strategy for achieving stereoselection by engineering reactions to occur through a unique kinetic scheme is introduced. The strategy, named \xe2\x80\x9ccomplex stereoselection\xe2\x80\x9d, effects stereoselection as a result of intermediates at the steady state partitioning successively between competing chemical transformations. A mathematical description of the ratio of products produced in the kinetic strategy is derived, and computer simulation of that model demonstrates two principal advantages of this method:\xe2\x80\x89 higher selectivity and more efficient conversion of substrates. These computer simulations were subsequently used to determine conditions for maximum stereoselection in these reactions via the framework of a series of hypothetical scenarios in six different incarnations of complex stereoselection. The resulting predictions present challenges to the field of experimental stereochemistry. "
"The kinetic model for compound stereoselection presented in previous paper is verified experimentally by conducting a series of radical cyclizations of 1-(3-halo-2-(halomethyl)propyl)cycloalk-2-enecarboxylates with tributyltin hydride and measuring the ratios of products. Cyclization rate constants are abstracted from the data by an analysis that minimizes total error, and these rate constants compare favorably with rate constants that we measured directly on the corresponding monohalides. Transition state modeling was used to interpret the initial round of results and to design two new systems, one of which was predicted to cyclize with higher selectivity than the parent and the other of which was predicted to cyclize with reverse selectivity. These substrates bearing 4-tert-butyl groups were synthesized, and the experimental results verified the computational predictions. "
"The characterization of the heterocyclic radical 1,2,5-thiadiazolo[3,4-b]-1,3,2-dithiazolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-2-yl (TDP-DTA) is described. The compound is prepared by treatment of 5,6-dithiolo-1,2,5-thiadiazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine with S3N3Cl3 and purified by fractional sublimation in vacuo. The results of cyclic voltammetry and ESR analysis of TDP-DTA and related heterocyclic dithiazolyls indicate that the spin distributions and donor/acceptor properties of these radicals are extremely sensitive to the nature of the 4,5-substituents. The crystal structure of TDP-DTA has been determined at two temperatures. At 293 K, the crystals are triclinic, space group P1\xcc\x84, with a = 4.4456(8), b = 8.407(2), c = 9.671(3) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb1 = 71.34(2), \xce\xb2 = 89.28(2), \xce\xb3 = 87.80(2)\xc2\xb0, Z = 2 (for C4N5S3); at 150 K the crystals are triclinic, space group P1\xcc\x84, with a = 7.489(7), b = 9.593(4), c = 10.759(6) \xc3\x85, \xce\xb1 = 65.77(4), \xce\xb2 = 74.10(6), \xce\xb3 = 74.64(6)\xc2\xb0, Z = 2 (for C8N10S6). At 293 K the structure consists of ribbons of TDP-DTA radicals packed in a slipped \xcf\x80-stack arrangement. In the low temperature phase alternate layers of ribbons are shifted laterally to produce arrays of dimers. Within these dimers three long (3.401(5), 3.460(5) and 3.511(5) \xc3\x85) interannular S---S contacts link the two molecules. A multiple \xe2\x80\x9ctectonic plate\xe2\x80\x9d slippage mechanism is proposed to account for the interconversion of the two phases. The structural results are discussed in the light of variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements. "
"While Ir(H)2(PtBu2Ph)2+ has been shown experimentally to have two agostic tBu groups, ab initio B3LYP calculations on IrH2[P(Et)H2]2+ show that the CH3 group of the phosphine ligand does not form any agostic bond with the strongly electron-deficient (14-valence electron) metal. In contrast, integrated molecular mechanics/molecular orbital (IMOMM) calculations on the full complex Ir(H)2(PtBu2Ph)2+ duplicate the experimentally observed agostic interaction. Thus, at least in this case, the agostic interaction is due in part to the trapping of a C\xe2\x88\x92H bond in the vicinity of the metal by the steric effects of the other groups of the bulky phosphine. This necessity of steric \xe2\x80\x9cconstraint\xe2\x80\x9d identifies an additional influential factor for the agostic interaction. "
"We observe potential dependent alignment and hydrogen bonding of interfacial water molecules at a charged air/water and CCl4/water interface. The interfacial potential is a result of the presence of charged soluble surfactant adsorbed to the interface. We vary the interface potential by changing the surface charge density, the ionic strength, and the temperature while monitoring OH stretching modes sensitive to the structure and hydrogen bonding of interfacial water molecules. As the potential is increased at the air/water interface we observe a progression from a waterlike and less hydrogen bond ordered structure to an icelike and more hydrogen bond ordered structure. This progression is a direct consequence of the induced alignment of the interfacial water molecules resulting from the large electrostatic field produced in the interfacial region by the charged surfactant. Temperature dependence measurements confirm the conclusion that there is a potential dependent alignment of the interfacial water molecules. In comparison, at the CCl4/water interface we observe only the icelike structure both in the presence and absence of a charged surfactant. The structural difference observed at the air/water and CCl4/water interfaces is discussed within the context of the structure imposing effect the nonpolar CCl4 molecules have on the interfacial water molecules.

"A combined computation, kinetic, and trapping study of the 2,5-didehydropyridine biradical finds the hydrogen abstraction reaction to be tunable by protonation. The observation of small amounts of pyridine products in the thermolysis of a C,N-dialkynylimine, or azaenediyne, only when the reaction occurs in the presence of moderate amounts of protic acid, is consistent with qualitative theoretical predictions as well as ab initio calculations at the CASSCF and CASMP2 levels. The implication of these findings for a more selective antitumor agent is discussed. "
"Photoinduced coupling of an acetylene with a quinone in two wavelength regions (\xce\xbbDB and \xce\xbbCT) can be regioselective to yield a single quinone methide adduct when various diarylacetylenes (DA) and 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone (DB) are used. Thus, the direct photoexcitation of DB at \xce\xbbDB = 355 nm or the specific activation of the 1:1 electron donor\xe2\x88\x92acceptor complex [DA,DB] at \xce\xbbCT = 532 nm both lead to the transient ion-radical pair [DA\xe2\x80\xa2+,DB\xe2\x80\xa2-], which is established by time-resolved (ps,ns) spectroscopy. Competition between back electron transfer (kBET) and ion-radical pair collapse (kC) to the distonic adduct DA-DB, as described in Schemes 1 and 2, limits the quantum yields for both photochemical processes in Table 4. The biradical nature of the distonic adduct in Scheme 3 accommodates the various facets of acetylene reactivity and unique regioselectivity to yield the same quinone methide by both actinic processes. In a more general context, the electron-transfer mechanism established by the charge-transfer excitation of [DA,DB] provides compelling evidence that the Paterno\xe2\x88\x92B\xc3\xbcchi coupling (by direct excitation of DB) can proceed via the same sequence of reactive intermediates.

"Quenching of singlet oxygen luminescence at 1.27 \xce\xbcm by PhS\xe2\x80\xa2, PhSO\xe2\x80\xa2, and peroxyl radicals PhOO\xe2\x80\xa2, t-BuOO\xe2\x80\xa2, PhCH2OO\xe2\x80\xa2, Ph2CHOO\xe2\x80\xa2, and Ph3COO\xe2\x80\xa2 was studied in liquid solution. The quantum yields of decomposition of different initiators which lead to the formation of free radicals were measured by using nanosecond transient absorption. This allowed determination of singlet oxygen O2(1\xce\x94g) quenching rate constants by the radicals. They are <2 \xc3\x97 108 M-1 s-1 for the sulfur-centered radicals and (2\xe2\x88\x927) \xc3\x97 109 M-1 s-1 for peroxyl radicals in acetonitrile. The rapid quenching is attributed to energy transfer quenching by the peroxyls, which have an n \xe2\x86\x92 \xcf\x80* transition leading to a low-lying 2A\xe2\x80\x98 state above their 2A\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 ground state. PhSO\xe2\x80\xa2 is shown computationally not to have such a low-lying 2A\xe2\x80\x98 state. There may be a very low-lying 2B1 state, for PhS\xe2\x80\xa2, but it is apparently not an efficient acceptor of electronic energy from O2(1\xce\x94g). "
"Reaction rate constants for the concerted proton transfer in cyclic hydrogen fluoride clusters obtained by using a variational transition state theory approach with high-level data at three stationary points and with interpolated corrections based on semiempirical Hamiltonians specially parametrized for these systemsMP2/6-311++G(3df,3pd)///PM3-SRPare reported. For the first time multidimensional tunneling is included in the large curvature limit. The corresponding small curvature limit is benchmarked against higher level calculations. The ridge of the reaction swath is defined in a general way and serves together with an estimate of the barrier width as a validation of the potential energy hypersurfaces. Recent experimental and theoretical results concerning carboxylic acids, whose hypersurfaces are found to be very similar to those of the HF clusters, underline the relevancy of the investigated concerted proton exchange motion. A reaction rate constant k(300 K) = 2.86 \xc3\x97 109 s-1 is found for (HF)5, which is similar to carboxylic acid dimers, whose experimental k(300 K) lie near 1010 s-1. "
"We propose that the apparent catalytic inactivity of Mn- and Fe-substituted superoxide dismutases (SODs) reflects E\xc2\xb0s that are either lower (Fe-sub-(Mn)SOD) or higher (Mn-sub-(Fe)SOD) than those of native Fe- or Mn-SODs. In support, we show that the E\xc2\xb0 of Fe-sub-(Mn)SOD (Fe substituted into Mn-SOD protein) is \xe2\x88\x92240 mV vs NHE, almost 0.5 V lower than our E\xc2\xb0 of 220 mV for Fe-SOD. The E\xc2\xb0 of Fe-sub-(Mn)SOD is lower than that of O2/O2\xe2\x80\xa2- and therefore is sufficient to explain Fe-sub-(Mn)SOD\'s inactivity. Indeed, Fe-sub-(Mn)SOD is shown to be unable to oxidize O2\xe2\x80\xa2-. Alternate causes of inactivity are ruled out by our demonstration that Fe-sub-(Mn)SOD retains the ability to reduce O2\xe2\x80\xa2-. Thus, the active site remains active with respect to substrate binding and proton and electron transfer. Finally, we show that Fe-sub-(Mn)SOD\'s inactivity with respect to O2\xe2\x80\xa2- oxidation cannot be solely due to competitive inhibition by OH-. Thus, our proposal provides a simple chemical basis for the observed catalytic inactivity of metal-exchanged Mn- or Fe-SODs and suggests that these strongly homologous enzymes may provide important insights into mechanisms of redox midpoint potential tuning in proteins.

"The modular strategy of a template-assembled synthetic protein (TASP) was used for the de novo synthesis of a 122-residue, antiparallel four-helix bundle protein which accommodates two bis-histidine ligated heme groups. The cyclic decapeptide template contains four cysteine residues with different protecting groups which allow coupling of the unprotected helices carrying bromoacetyl units either at the N-terminus or the \xce\xb5-amino group of a C-terminal lysine residue. The amphiphilic helices realize a water-soluble model of the cytochrome b core with two parallel heme-binding helices alternating with two antiparallel helices shielding the two hydrophobic heme binding sites. The spectral properties resemble those of the natural protein. Characterization by mass spectrometry and circular dichroism support the anticipated structure. The free energy of folding shows a stabilizing effect by the two heme groups which have respective redox midpoint potentials of \xe2\x88\x92106 and \xe2\x88\x92170 mV. This modular protein combines the advantage of the structural organization of a TASP with the incorporation of functional groups. "
"The quinone methide (QM) rhodium complex of 3,5-bis(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)-2,6-dimethyl-4-methylene-3,5-cyclohexadien-1-one (L) (1) was protonated by trifluromethanesulfonic acid (triflic acid) at the quinonoid carbonyl group giving the unique methylene arenium complex (Cl)Rh[LH+]CF3SO3- (2). Complexes 2 and its (trimethyl)silyl analogue (3) were fully characterized spectroscopically, and complex 2 was also characterized by single-crystal X-ray analysis. The crystallographic studies on 2 have revealed that the positive charge is delocalized between the carbon atoms of the ring with most of it being at the para- and ortho-carbon atoms. The electron deficient QM complex (CO)Rh+[L] CF3SO3- (4), which has also been crystallographically characterized, is less basic, requiring excess of triflic acid to obtain the methylene arenium complex (CO)Rh+[LH+]2CF3SO3- (5), demonstrating a dramatic effect of the electron density on the metal center on the stability of the methylene arenium species. When 1 was reacted with 2\xe2\x88\x923 equiv of MeLi formation of two complexes, MeRh[3,5-bis(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)-2,6-dimethyl-4-methylene-3,5-cyclohexadien-1-en] (6) and its ortho-xylylene isomer (7), took place. Complexes 6 and 7 represent the first example of thermally stable xylylenes coordinated via only one of the exocyclic double bonds. Both 6 and 7 undergo protonation by CF3SO3H giving as a single product the arenium complex CF3SO3Rh[3,5-bis(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)-1,2,6-trimethyl-4-methylene-3,5-cyclohexadienyl]+CF3SO3- (8). 13C NMR studies performed on the arenium complexes shows no para-substituent effect on the chemical shift of the coordinated CH2 group and that this group does not participate in the positive charge delocalization. Thus, the reported methylene arenium compounds can be viewed as a resonance form of a benzyl cation stabilized by metal complexation. "
"Using a constrained molecular modeling method, we have generated DNA (D), RNA (R), and hybrid DNA/RNA triple-helical structures. Starting with the reference frame defined by the X-ray fiber diffraction model of the poly(dT)\xc2\xb7poly(dA)+poly(dT) triple helix, where \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xb7\xe2\x80\x9d denotes Watson\xe2\x88\x92Crick pairing and \xe2\x80\x9c+\xe2\x80\x9d indicates Hoogsteen pairing, we have exhaustively sampled the arrangements of the sugar\xe2\x88\x92phosphate backbone that connect adjacent bases on each of the three strands. We focus attention on regular polymer models constructed from conformationally identical repeating units. Structures free of local steric constraints are combined in all possible ways to build short triplexes, and overall triple helix energies are computed under several different dielectric environments. The predicted ordering of Pyr\xc2\xb7Pu+Pyr triplex stabilities, D\xc2\xb7D+D > D\xc2\xb7D+R > D\xc2\xb7R+D > D\xc2\xb7R+R > R\xc2\xb7D+D > R\xc2\xb7D+R > R\xc2\xb7R+D > R\xc2\xb7R+R, agrees qualitatively with measured stabilities of triplexes containing DNA and/or RNA single strands in gel electrophoresis, NMR, X-ray, and thermodynamic studies. The relevance of the computed data to other triple helical simulations is also discussed. "
"We describe nucleic acid triple-helical structures containing either amide or 2\xe2\x80\x98-5\xe2\x80\x98 linkages, the former backbone describing the chemistry of certain peptide nucleic acids (PNA). The methodology and the starting reference frame are the same as those described in the preceding article. Apart from evaluating the possible combinations of chain conformations that connect adjacent bases on each of the three strands, we have examined the feasibility of triplex formation when neighboring Watson\xe2\x88\x92Crick+Hoogsteen hydrogen-bonded base triples are displaced by small amounts along their short and long axes. The predicted triple-helical complexes are examined in terms of relevant crystallographic, spectroscopic, and calorimetric data. The computed models clarify why PNA cannot form B-like structures and also reveal principles useful for the design of other triplex-forming DNA mimics. "
"This article describes the design, function, and application of simple microfluidic networks as conduits for the patterned delivery of chemical reactants onto a substrate. It demonstrates how such networks, made in an elastomer, allow simultaneous delivery of functionally distinct molecules onto targeted regions of a surface (Delamarche, E. et al. Science 1997, 276, 779\xe2\x88\x92781). Microfluidic networks generally consume less than microliter quantities of solution and are thus well suited for use when the required reagents are scarce or precious, as often occurs in experiments and technologies that place biochemicals on solid planar substrates. We illustrate some of the particular challenges of doing chemistry inside the narrow confines of capillaries defined by fluidic networks, in addition to the advantages attendant to this approach, in the context of forming patterned arrays of different, and functional, immunoglobulins useful in highly localized biological assays.

"A series of complexes has been prepared of the form [Os(NH3)5(4,5-\xce\xb72-L)]2+ where L = furan and various alkylated furans. These heterocycle complexes were surveyed for their reactivity with various electrophiles (e.g., acids, silyl triflate, N-methylacetonitrilium triflate, acetals, aldehydes, and Michael acceptors). Electrophilic addition to C(3) results in an unstable reaction intermediate, a 4,5-\xce\xb72-3H-furanium species, that leads to complexes of 4,5-\xce\xb72-3-substituted furans, 2,3-dihydrofurans, C(5)-substituted 2-oxoalkenes, cyclic vinyl ethers, or osmium carbyne complexes. The specific reactivity displayed by the \xce\xb72-furan complexes strongly depends on the presence and location of alkyl substituents and their ability to stabilize \xce\xb72-vinyl cation intermediates resulting from C(5)\xe2\x88\x92O bond cleavage. In all cases investigated, the addition of an electrophile at C3 occurs anti to osmium coordination. "
"Cyclotrigallazane, [H2GaNH2]3, was prepared by condensing liquid ammonia onto solid trimethylamine gallane, GaH3(NMe3), at \xe2\x88\x9278 \xc2\xb0C and allowing the mixture to warm to room temperature and was characterized by IR, mass spectroscopy, elemental analysis, single-crystal X-ray, and neutron powder diffraction. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction at T = \xe2\x88\x92167 \xc2\xb0C established that the (GaN)3 ring was in the chair conformation. Neutron powder diffraction data collected at 25 \xc2\xb0C on the fully deuterated analogue were analyzed with Rietveld refinement to give an average bond distance for Ga\xe2\x88\x92D of 1.56(3) \xc3\x85 and a N\xe2\x88\x92D of 1.04(5) \xc3\x85. The intermolecular interactions were dominated by four Ga\xe2\x88\x92H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7H\xe2\x88\x92N unconventional hydrogen bonds per molecule that form a chain parallel to the crystallographic a axis. The crystallographically equivalent D\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7D bond lengths are 1.97 \xc3\x85. Calculations revealed that in the gas phase, twist-boat conformations are preferred over chairs for cyclotrigallazane and the related boron and aluminum compounds by 0.9 to 2.6 kcal/mol at correlated levels of electronic structure theory. For cyclotriborazane and cyclotrigallazane, calculations suggest that each H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7H hydrogen bond contributes about 3 kcal/mol to the binding energy (relative to the chair monomer); this value is very slightly higher for cyclotrialumazane.

"The new compounds [H2GaE(SiMe3)2]3 (E = P (1), As (2)), the first authenticated examples of a phosphinogallane and an arsinogallane containing the GaH2 moiety, are prepared via efficient dehydrosilylation from the respective combinations of H3Ga\xc2\xb7NMe3 and E(SiMe3)3 in diethyl ether or toluene. Compounds 1 and 2 are characterized by elemental analysis, NMR, IR, and mass spectrometry. Single-crystal X-ray structural studies show that the molecular structures of 1 and 2 feature a flattened six-member ring of alternating Ga and E centers. Both compounds are reasonably stable at \xe2\x88\x9230 \xc2\xb0C but spontaneously decompose at ambient temperatures, 2 noticeably faster than 1, with the evolution of HSiMe3, H2, and E(SiMe3)3. The pyrolysis of 1 yields nanocrystalline GaP while the pyrolysis of solids from decayed 2 results in nanocrystalline GaAs as determined from XRD studies. Under applied pyrolysis conditions, the thermally accelerated dehydrosilylation of the precursors is accompanied by a side-evolution of CH4 and retention of small quantities of amorphous Si/C phases.

"Adsorption isotherms are reported for HZSM-5 and silica gel using a series of gas adsorptives at several temperatures above their critical temperature. The data are analyzed with a new multiple equilibria adsorption model producing equilibrium constants (Ki), capacities (ni), and enthalpies (\xe2\x88\x92\xce\x94Hi) for each of the processes. Unlike the amorphous adsorbents studied earlier, which contain a distribution of pore sizes, zeolitic materials have uniform pore dimensions. This uniformity provides a test of our interpretation of the number of processes required in the isotherm fits of the multiple equilibrium analysis, MEA. As expected from the two pores in the structure of HZSM-5, most adsorbates require two processes (K1,ads and K2,ads) to fit the adsorption isotherms. HZSM-5 is compared to amorphous carbonaceous adsorbents, revealing fundamental differences in their behavior. Small cylindrical channels in HZSM-5 lead to an unfavorable entropic contribution from restrictions imposed by adsorptive packing and interactions with the channel walls. The pores of the carbons studied (Drago, R. S.; Kassel, W. S.; Burns, D. S.; McGilvray, J. M.; Lafrenz, T. J.; Showalter, S. K. J. Phys. Chem. B 1997, 101, 7548\xe2\x88\x927555) are slit-shaped, leading to less restriction and larger equilibrium constants. For several adsorbates, the greater enthalpic interactions in the small HZSM-5 pores are accompanied by lower equilibrium constants than in the larger pores because of unfavorable entropic contributions. Finally, the larger total micropore volumes of the carbons studied for these adsorptives (Drago, R. S.; Kassel, W. S.; Burns, D. S.; McGilvray, J. M.; Lafrenz, T. J.; Showalter, S. K. J. Phys. Chem. B 1997, 101, 7548\xe2\x88\x927555) result in increased capacity compared to HZSM-5. The process capacities from MEA (mol g-1) are converted to pore volumes using the molar volume. Surface areas are calculated from molecular areas of the adsorbates. Pore volumes and surface areas calculated from the process capacities are compared to those from conventional N2 porosimetry and are shown to provide a more detailed and more accurate assessment of areas and volumes. These results show that MEA has the potential of becoming a standard characterization method for microporous solids that will lead to an increased understanding of their behavior in gas adsorption and catalysis.

"DFT quantum chemical methods are used to probe the mechanism of the nickel\xe2\x88\x92iron hydrogenases. Starting from the experimental X-ray structure, all plausible oxidation states and spin states were investigated. The structure and reactivity pattern of the NiFe cluster are best reproduced by assuming a NiFe(II,III) oxidation state assignment of the resting state of the cluster. In our proposed mechanism of H2 oxidation by the enzyme, H2 first binds to Fe in the form of a molecular hydrogen complex, which then undergoes heterolytic splitting. This process is spin-dependent and does not occur for the high-spin sextet state. In the key step, hydride transfer to iron and proton transfer to the adjacent cysteinethiolate ligand is accompanied by decoordination of the protonated cysteinethiol from Ni while remaining bound to iron. Simultaneously, the cyanide ligand on iron binds with the nickel atom in a rare bridging binding mode. After the H2 dissociation, the hydride bound to Fe can then be transferred to Ni which should be a necessary preliminary for subsequent hydrogen atom or electron transport. The transition state for hydrogen splitting was located, and the resulting calculated energy barrier is in remarkably good agreement with the experimental value. "
"An autocatalytic mechanism for helium incorporation into buckminsterfullerene has been examined by MNDO, density functional theory (DFT), and ab initio calculations. The mechanism involves dimerization of two molecules by [2+2] cycloaddition between double bonds at hexagon junctions, formation of a stable closed-shell window, and helium insertion through this window. According to MNDO, the activation barriers do not exceed 100 kcal/mol for any of these steps. At the DFT level, the window isomer is kinetically less stable and may therefore be mechanistically less relevant. Even in this case, the effective DFT activation barrier for helium incorporation into the [2+2] dimer is around 130 kcal/mol, much lower than for buckminsterfullerene itself. Vibrational and NMR spectra are predicted for the proposed window dimer to facilitate its experimental detection. The applicability of the dimer mechanism to other noble gases and to higher fullerenes is also discussed, as well as possible variants involving helium incorporation by C60 polymers and by tethered C60 dimers.

"The entire reaction pathway for the gas-phase methane\xe2\x88\x92methanol conversion by late transition-metal-oxide ions, MnO+, FeO+, and CoO+, is studied using an ab initio hybrid (Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock/density-functional) method. For these oxo complexes, the methane\xe2\x88\x92methanol conversion is proposed to proceed via two transition states (TSs) in such a way MO+ + CH4 \xe2\x86\x92 OM+(CH4) \xe2\x86\x92 [TS1] \xe2\x86\x92 HO\xe2\x88\x92M+\xe2\x88\x92CH3 \xe2\x86\x92 [TS2] \xe2\x86\x92 M+(CH3OH) \xe2\x86\x92 M+ + CH3OH, where M is Mn, Fe, and Co. A crossing between high-spin and low-spin potential energy surfaces occurs both at the entrance channel and at the exit channel for FeO+ and CoO+, but it occurs only once near TS2 for MnO+. The activation energy from OMn+(CH4) to HO\xe2\x88\x92Mn+\xe2\x88\x92CH3 via TS1 is calculated to be 9.4 kcal/mol, being much smaller than 22.1 and 30.9 kcal/mol for FeO+ and CoO+, respectively. This agrees with the experimentally reported efficiencies for the reactions. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment indicates that HO\xe2\x88\x92M+\xe2\x88\x92CH3 plays a central role as an intermediate in the reaction between MO+ and methane and that the reaction efficiency is most likely to be determined by the activation energy from OM+(CH4) to HO\xe2\x88\x92M+\xe2\x88\x92CH3 via TS1. We discuss in terms of qualitative orbital interactions why MnO+ (d4 oxo complex) is most effective for methane C\xe2\x88\x92H bond activation. The activation energy from HO\xe2\x88\x92M+\xe2\x88\x92CH3 to M+(CH3OH) via TS2 is computed to be 24.6, 28.6, and 35.9 kcal/mol for CoO+, FeO+, and MnO+, respectively. This result explains an experimental result that the methanol-branching ratio in the reaction between MO+ and methane is 100% in CoO+, 41% in FeO+, and < 1% in MnO+. We demonstrate that both the barrier heights of TS1 and TS2 would determine general catalytic selectivity for the methane\xe2\x88\x92methanol conversion by the MO+ complexes. "
"Geometries of A4X10 molecules (A = C, Si; X = H, F, Cl, Br, CH3, SiH3) have been optimized at the HF/6-31G* level as a function of the AAAA dihedral angle \xcf\x89. In addition to the generally known gauche and trans conformational minima, some have an additional (\xe2\x80\x9cortho\xe2\x80\x9d) minimum near \xcf\x89 = 90\xc2\xb0. This appears only within a certain critical range of sizes of substituents X. It is attributed to a splitting of the ordinary gauche minimum by 1,4 interactions between substituents, similarly as the twisting of the anti minimum from 180\xc2\xb0 is attributable to 1,3 interactions. A universal model is proposed to rationalize the appearance and subsequent disappearance of the ortho minimum as X increases in size. It contains intrinsic barriers described according to Weinhold, van der Waals interactions described by a Lennard-Jones 6\xe2\x88\x9212 potential, and Coulomb charge\xe2\x88\x92charge interactions.

"15N and 13C NMR have been used to study three specifically labeled RNA fragments that include two tandem GU wobble pairs of different thermal stability and a tetraloop GU pair. The data are also compared to earlier 15N NMR work on an isolated, intrahelical GU pair. The results provide qualitative information on the relative contributions by stacking and hydrogen bonding to chemical shift changes at specific sites in a variety of GU pairs. Chemical shifts for the unpaired guanine amino groups in the isolated and both tandem wobble pairs are all significantly upfield of corresponding paired GC aminos. The guanine amino of the tetraloop is further downfield, as expected for a base paired hydrogen bond donor. Thus, 15N NMR can be diagnostic for the presence of base\xe2\x88\x92base pairing in RNA. Chemical shifts of the guanine N1 in all four GU pairs show significant shielding effects, particularly those of the more stable tandem GU pair. Similar shielding is also seen in the 13C data for the C2 atom of the GU wobble pairs. Our results demonstrate that these adjacent ring atoms (N1 and C2) are in the shielding regions of neighboring bases, and that specific labeling can provide information on base stacking. Thus, where global structure is known, specific labeling can be invaluable as a complement to probe local interactions. It is likely, however, that the most important use of specific labeling will be with complex systems in which global structural information is incomplete. "
"Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation studies have been performed on homo- and heteroduplexes involving peptide nucleic acids (PNA) in aqueous solution under periodic boundary conditions. PNA is a DNA analogue that is homomorphous to DNA, but has an electrically neutral pseudopeptide backbone. In the present study we have investigated the structure and dynamics of duplex systems involving PNA in aqueous solution and how the overall structural and dynamical features of a double helix depend on the nature of the backbones of the constituent strands. Four different duplex systems have been studied:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) PNA-PNA duplex (1.15 ns), (ii) PNA-DNA antiparallel duplex (0.64 ns), (iii) PNA-DNA parallel duplex (0.6 ns), and (iv) DNA-DNA duplex (0.64 ns). Comparison of the structural features obtained from this study on PNA-DNA antiparallel and PNA-PNA duplex systems with those obtained from NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies respectively has shown very good agreement. In all the cases the structures were stable over the entire period of simulations and the results indicate that the complementary bases and a backbone homomorphous to DNA are sufficient to maintain a stable double helix. The antiparallel PNA-DNA duplex and the PNA-PNA duplex have average structures between A- and B-helixes with certain A-like features while the parallel PNA-DNA double helix, as predicted in this study, is more close to the B-helix. No major difference in the geometries and dynamics of the base pairs in the different duplexes was found. However, the helicoidal parameters are found to be different for the different duplexes. These indicate that the actual structure is determined by the base pairing and the base stacking with the backbones causing some perturbations to this basic structure. The internal dynamics in the base linker region shows highly restricted motions even in the PNA strands where there is no ribose ring. "
"The binding specificity for the intercalating Ru(tpy)(dppz)O2+ complex (tpy = 2,2\xe2\x80\x98,2\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98-terpyridine; dppz = dipyridophenazine) was investigated for duplex DNA, HIV-1 TAR DNA and RNA, and tRNAPhe. Unlike other dppz compounds studied to date, this compound cleaves nucleic acids at short range, and the resulting cleavage pattern can therefore be directly related to the recognition properties of the dppz ligand. To assign the intercalative recognition sites, a comparison was first made between the cleavage patterns of Ru(tpy)(dppz)O2+ and Ru(tpy)(bpy)O2+ (bpy = 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-bipyridine), which differs from Ru(tpy)(dppz)O2+ only by the absence of the intercalative dppz functionality. Cleavage sites common to both complexes were assigned to binding properties other than intercalation, whereas any additional sites observed for Ru(tpy)(dppz)O2+ were strongly implicated as the sites of intercalative recognition. It was necessary, however, to distinguish between those sites which represent a strong binding affinity and those sites which were instead made more accessible to cleavage by binding of another equivalent of the intercalating complex at a remote site. We therefore investigated the cleavage pattern of Ru(tpy)(bpy)O2+ with and without the classical intercalator Pt(tpy)(HET)+ (HET = 2-hydroxyethanethiolate) to determine the effect of decoupling the intercalative recognition and oxidation chemistry. In this experiment, sites where cleavage inhibition was observed were indicative of intercalative recognition by the platinum complex, whereas sites where cleavage enhancement was observed strongly suggested that intercalative binding at a remote site had altered the structure of the nucleic acid. Comparison of the cleavage patterns of Ru(tpy)(bpy)O2+ and Ru(tpy)(dppz)O2+ for a duplex oligonucleotides, tRNA, and stem\xe2\x88\x92loop structures suggests a recognition pattern for the dppz ligand very similar to that of classical intercalators.

"The alternating copolymerizations of carbon monoxide with the electron-poor bicyclic olefins, diethyl bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene-2,3-dicarboxylate (1) and diethyl 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene-2,3-dicarboxylate (2), is achieved with neutral palladium(II) initiators. These Pd(II) complexes utilize a \xcf\x83,\xcf\x80-alkyl ligand, a halide anion, and 1 equiv of a stabilizing donor ligand (pyridine or triphenylphosphine). The preferred catalyst, due to reactivity and stability, is iodo(endo-6-phenyl-2-norbornene-endo-5\xcf\x83,2\xcf\x80)(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) (6). This initiator produces living copolymerizations of 1 with CO in the presence of H2O and O2. The polymer isolated, poly(1-alt-CO), retains the Pd as the endgroup, and can be used to reinitiate copolymerization leading to chain extension or diblock copolymer formation. Both of the copolymers poly(1-alt-CO) and poly-(2-alt-CO) undergo retro Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reaction to produce furan derivative 7 and a new cross-conjugated material, poly(ketovinylene) (PKV). While the temperature for complete conversion of poly(1-alt-CO) is ca. 280 \xc2\xb0C, poly(2-alt-CO) goes to completion at room temperature and above. During this thermal conversion, the polymer undergoes melt flow that is assisted by the ejected furan solvent, allowing for the fabrication of wires and free-standing films of the conjugated material.

"A new class of self-assembling transmembrane ion channels based on cyclic \xce\xb23-peptides is described. Cyclic peptide subunits were designed to adopt flat, ring shaped conformations and stack through extensive backbone-backbone hydrogen bonding to form tubular channel structures. Candidate channel-forming peptides cyclo[(-\xce\xb23-HTrp)4-] 1, cyclo[(-\xce\xb23-HTrp-\xce\xb2-HLeu)2-] 2, and cyclo[(-\xce\xb23-HLeu)4-] 3 were examined in liposome-based proton transport assays and single channel conductance experiments. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited remarkable ion transport activities with single-channel K+ conductance of 56 pS for peptide 1, while compound 3 was inactive, possibly due to its poor solubility. Additionally, the putative structure of transmembrane channels formed by peptides 1 and 2 was supported by FT-IR spectroscopy of membrane-peptide preparations. The present system not only complements that of channel-forming cyclic d,l-\xce\xb1-peptides previously reported from this laboratory but also is expected to exhibit novel properties arising from the unnatural \xce\xb23-peptide backbone.

"An extremely efficient method has been found for the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of conjugated \xce\xb1,\xce\xb3-dienamide esters using the Et-DuPHOS-Rh catalyst system. \xce\xb1,\xce\xb3-Dienamide ester substrates were prepared via the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction and the Horner\xe2\x88\x92Emmons olefination. Full conversion to the corresponding \xce\xb3,\xce\xb4-unsaturated amino acids with very high regio- and enantioselectivity was achieved after short reaction times. This new methodology was applied to the synthesis of the natural product bulgecinine from a prochiral dienamide ester. "
"The synthesis, thin-film morphology, and hole mobility in thin-film transistors (TFTs) of compounds based on the novel anthradithiophene (ADT) ring system are reported. The parent compound and its 2,8-dihexyl, didodecyl, and dioctadecyl derivatives (DHADT, DDADT, and DOADT, respectively), synthesized via alkylated thiophene dicarboxaldehyde acetals, were investigated. They all form highly ordered polycrystalline vacuum-evaporated films with mobilities as high as 0.15 cm2/(V s), as high as has ever been observed for a polycrystalline organic material. DOADT has a mobility of 0.06 cm2/(V s) even though 70% of its molecular volume is occupied by hydrocarbon chains. DHADT was cast from solution under atmospheric conditions onto a TFT giving a mobility of 0.01\xe2\x88\x920.02 cm2/(V s). Thus, the alkylated ADTs combine a pentacene-like intrinsic mobility with greater solubility and oxidative stability. "
"A series of p,p\xe2\x80\x98-disubstituted 7-phenyl-7-(2-fluorophenyl)norbornanes 5xy has been prepared, and the barrier (\xce\x94G#) to 160\xc2\xb0 libration around the 2-fluoroaryl-norbornane bond has been measured by DNMR. There is spectroscopic evidence of strong homoconjugative and charge-transfer (CT) interactions between both aryl groups of 5xy. However, the relationship between \xce\x94G# and the nature of the substituents X and Y is accounted for only by electrostatic interactions between both aryl groups in the ground state as well as in the transition state of the libration. Therefore, the notion of CT and aromatic homoconjugation as strong attractive forces between aryl groups should be definitively rejected. "
"The reactant cluster and transition state for epoxidation of allyl alcohol with peroxyformic acid have been located at the MP2/6-31G(d) level of theory. The free energy of activation (\xce\x94 = 19.8 kcal/mol) predicted at the MP4//MP2/6-31G(d) level is quite comparable with experimental data for epoxidation of 3-hydroxycyclohexene (\xce\x94 = 19.7 kcal/mol). A spiro transition state (TS) was found where the plane defined by the peroxyacid moiety is oriented at 89\xc2\xb0 to the CC bond axis. Intrinsic reaction coordinate analysis suggests that after the barrier is crossed a 1,4-hydrogen migration of the peroxyacid hydrogen to the carbonyl oxygen takes place in concert with O\xe2\x88\x92O bond cleavage affording the epoxide of allyl alcohol hydrogen bonded to the neutral formic acid leaving group. The activation parameters calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level are in excellent agreement with the MP4//MP2 values. The transition structure with the allyl alcohol O\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92CC dihedral angle of 16.4\xc2\xb0 is 2.1 kcal/mol lower in energy than a transition structure with a dihedral angle of 134.3\xc2\xb0. The directing effect of the hydroxyl group is attributed initially to a primary hydrogen bonding interaction between the relatively more acidic peroxy acid proton and the oxygen of the allyl alcohol. In both the reactant complex 1 and the transition structure (TS-2) for oxygen atom transfer the alcohol remains hydrogen bonded to the more basic carbonyl oxygen of the peroxyacid. The G2 proton affinities (PA298) of the carbonyl oxygen and the proximal peroxo oxygen of peroxyformic acid are 177.1 and 153.3 kcal/mol, respectively. "
In a combined modeling and experimental study the twin interface in saccharin crystals has been used as the basis for energetic calculations and visualization of the solid\xe2\x88\x92solid interface. A methodology has been developed that has wide applicability to a range of interfaces between crystalline materials. 
"Convergent total syntheses of the extremely potent cell growth inhibitor cephalostatin 1 and two hybrid analogues, ritterostatins GN1N and GN1S, have been achieved. Ritterostatin GN1N displays sub-nanomolar activity in the 60 cell line human tumor panel of the National Cancer Institute. The North hemisphere of ritterazine G was efficiently constructed from hecogenin acetate in 15% yield over 13 steps. Extension of a key photolysis/Prins sequence to intermediates 19 and 32 proceeded in excellent yield, leading to installation of the \xce\x9414 moiety in the North G and South 1 steroidal subunits. Application of a method for directed unsymmetrical coupling furnished the natural and analogue pyrazines in good yield from the cephalostatin and ritterazine components. "
"A set of silyl enol ethers and ketene acetals 1a\xe2\x88\x92h with \xce\xb1- and/or \xce\xb2-phenyl as well as alkyl substituents of different steric bulk has been submitted to the enantioselective catalytic oxidation by chiral (salen)MnIII complexes 3. Highest conversions and best enantioselectivities have been obtained with bleach rather than iodosobenzene as oxygen source for the active oxo\xe2\x88\x92metal species. With regard to substrate structure, ee values up to 89% have been achieved for enol ethers with short and unbranched alkyl substituents at the siloxy position. While \xce\xb2-phenyl groups are beneficial for enantiofacial control, phenyl substituents \xce\xb1 to the siloxy functionality result in lower ee values, while the diphenyl-substituted derivative 1d displays the lowest stereoselectivity. The fact that \xce\xb2- versus \xce\xb1-phenyl substituents exhibit not only differences in the magnitude but also in the sense (opposite absolute product configuration) of the stereoselectivity may be utilized as a valuable mechanistic probe to assess steric and electronic effects in the substrate and the catalyst as a function of the type and pattern of substitution. Our results display that steric interactions between the substrate and the oxo\xe2\x88\x92metal complex are mainly responsible for the observed stereochemical preferences. Indeed, significantly increased enantioselectivities are achieved even for the remote siloxy group when bulkier derivatives are employed. In contrast, primarily electronic effects operate in the (salen)MnIII catalyst 3 since electron-donating groups in the 5,5\xe2\x80\x98 positions of the salicylaldehyde ligand afford higher ee values in this catalytic oxidation. The skewed side-on approach (trajectory b) of the substrate onto the oxo\xe2\x88\x92metal catalyst is favored, the metallaoxetane mechanism adequately accounts for the observed enantioselectivities. Herewith a synthetically valuable method for the preparation of optically active \xce\xb1-hydroxy carbonyl products 2 has been made available through the catalytic, enantioselective oxidation of the silyl enol ethers 1 by (salen)MnIII complexes.

"The control of reactivity and/or selectivity of organotin(IV) enolates has been studied by means of a high coordination method in which the hybridization state of tin was effectively changed. An anionic tin complex, five-coordinated tin enolate 1(h), was formed by the coordination of bromide anion from tetrabutylammonium bromide (Bu4NBr) to neutral four-coordinated tin(IV) enolates 1(e). The highly coordinated enolates which attained a marked change in chemoselectivity have higher nucleophilicity to organic halides. In addition, they showed low nucleophilicity toward carbonyl moieties by the coordination of the bromide anion, whereas carbonyl addition readily proceeds using the usual four-coordinated tin enolate. NMR studies revealed the generation of HMPA- or bromide-anion-coordinated tin enolates in equilibrium between four-coordinated enolate 1c(e) and five-coordinated enolate 1c(h), showing a considerable upfield shift \xce\xb4(119Sn) and increasing values of the coupling constants 1J(119Sn\xe2\x88\x9213C). In detailed NMR analyses of highly coordinated tin enolate, it was shown that the contribution of highly coordinated species 1(h) to the equilibrium between 1(e) and 1(h) became more significant as the added amount of ligands such as Bu4NBr or HMPA was increased. Considering these results, it was assumed that the bromide-anion-coordinated tin enolate was generated, which showed a unique reactivity and selectivity. The effective control of chemoselectivity in the intermolecularly competitive reaction between organic halides and carbonyl compounds was demonstrated using two types of tin enolates, four-coordinated enolate and highly coordinated anionic enolate; halide displacement reaction exclusively took place using the bromide-anion-coordinated enolate, and the usual four-coordinated enolates reacted with only carbonyl compounds.

"Kinetic addition of nucleophiles occurs at the center carbon of \xce\xb73-propargyl rhenium complexes to produce rhenacyclobutenes. Reaction of P(CH3)3 with C5Me5(CO)2Re[\xce\xb73-CH2C\xe2\x8b\xaeCC(CH3)3]+BF4- (3a) gave the metallacyclobutene C5Me5(CO)2ReCH2C(PMe3)CC(CH3)3+BF4- (4a), which was characterized by X-ray crystallography. Malonate and acetylide nucleophiles reacted with C5Me5(CO)2Re[\xce\xb73-CH2C\xe2\x8b\xaeCCH3]+PF6- (3b) to give metallacyclobutene complexes. Pyridine added to the central propargyl carbon of 3b at low temperature to produce the metastable metallacyclobutene C5Me5(CO)2ReCH2C(NC5H5)CCH3+PF6- (14b) which rearranged to the \xce\xb72-allene complex C5Me5(CO)2Re[\xce\xb72-H2CCC(NC5H5)CH3]+PF6- (15K) at room temperature. 4-(Dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) added to the central carbon of the tert-butyl-substituted \xce\xb73-propargyl complex 3a below \xe2\x88\x9238 \xc2\xb0C to give the rhenacyclobutene complex C5Me5(CO)2ReCH2C(NC5H4NMe2)CC(CH3)3+BF4- (22a) which rearranged to the \xce\xb72-alkyne complex C5Me5(CO)2Re[\xce\xb72-(CH3)3CC\xe2\x8b\xaeCCH2NC5H4NMe2]+BF4- (23) at room temperature.

"Near-monodisperse microscopic nanostructures of MoS2 were prepared by thermal decomposition of two different ammonium thiomolybdate molecular precursors, (NH4)2MoS4 and (NH4)2Mo3S13, within the confined voids of a porous aluminum oxide membrane template. Our low-temperature (450 \xc2\xb0C) synthetic route yielded large quantities of hollow tubules of MoS2 of uniform size and shape that were \xe2\x88\xbc30 \xce\xbcm long with diameters of 50 nm and wall thicknesses of about 10 nm. More irregularly shaped, mainly solid fibers of MoS2 with diameters of about 200 nm were synthesized by changing the template to one with larger pores. The morphology of the fibers or tubules was studied with respect to the choice of precursor, the characteristics of the precursor solutions, the incorporation methods, the template characteristics, and the heat treatment during firing. The MoS2 structures were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopies, energy dispersive spectroscopy, electron and X-ray diffraction, and optical absorption spectroscopy. This template-assisted growth process yielded large quantities of MoS2 tubules or fibers that could be isolated from the template. However, under the growth conditions studied, the formation of HxMoS2 \xe2\x80\x9cbronzes\xe2\x80\x9d could not be discounted. "
"Clavaminate synthase (CS) is one member of a large class of non-heme iron enzymes that require \xce\xb1-ketoglutarate (\xce\xb1-KG) as a cosubstrate. While the majority of this class catalyzes the hydroxylation of unactivated C\xe2\x88\x92H bonds, CS is unusual in that in addition to performing hydroxylation chemistry, it also catalyzes the key oxidative ring closure and desaturation steps in the biosynthetic pathway to the potent \xce\xb2-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. A single non-heme Fe2+ site is responsible for all three of these reactions (hydroxylation, oxidative ring closure, and desaturation), during which 1 equiv of \xce\xb1-KG per reaction is decarboxylated into succinate and CO2. We have applied circular dichroism (CD), magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), and variable-temperature, variable-field (VTVH) MCD spectroscopies to probe the geometric and electronic structure of the ferrous active site in the isozyme CS2 and its interaction with \xce\xb1-KG. CD titration experiments show stoichiometric binding of Fe2+ to the apoenzyme, either with or without \xce\xb1-KG, as well as stoichiometric binding of \xce\xb1-KG to the iron-containing enzyme. However, in the absence of the metal, the \xce\xb1-KG binding constant is reduced, indicating that Fe2+ facilitates cosubstrate binding at the active site. Ligand field CD and MCD data show that resting CS2 contains a six-coordinate ferrous center (10Dq = 10\xe2\x80\x89050 cm-1, \xce\x945Eg = 1690 cm-1) and that addition of \xce\xb1-KG perturbs the site to produce a different six-coordinate center (10Dq = 9500 cm-1, \xce\x945Eg = 1630 cm-1). VTVH MCD analysis finds a ground-state splitting for resting CS2 (\xce\x945T2g \xe2\x89\x88 \xe2\x88\x92400 cm-1) that is fairly typical of six-coordinate ferrous sites, but a much larger splitting for CS2 + \xce\xb1-KG (\xce\x945T2g \xe2\x89\x88 \xe2\x88\x921000 cm-1), indicative of Fe2+\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb1-KG \xcf\x80 interactions. UV/vis absorption, CD, and MCD spectroscopies have been applied to further probe the interaction of the cosubstrate with the metalloenzyme. These data show the appearance of low-lying metal-to-ligand charge-transfer transitions which demonstrate that \xce\xb1-KG binds directly to the iron. Furthermore, analysis and comparison to model complex data support a bidentate binding mode of \xce\xb1-KG, indicating that cosubstrate displaces two ligands from the six-coordinate resting active site to form a new six-coordinate \xce\xb1-KG-bound Fe2+ site. These results provide the first direct spectroscopic information about the nature of the CS2 ferrous active site and its interaction with \xce\xb1-KG and lend insight into the mechanism of this multifunctional enzyme.

"In this paper we report on the isolation, structural characterization, and reactivity of a series of lanthanide ketyl complexes, which are generated by reactions of benzophenone and fluorenone with several different types of lanthanide reducing agents including Ln(OAr)2(L)x (Ar = C6H2-tBu2-2,6-Me-4; 1a: Ln = Sm, L = THF, x = 3; 1b: Ln = Yb, L = THF, x = 3; 1c: Ln = Sm, L = HMPA, x = 2; 1d: Ln = Yb, L = HMPA, x = 2), (C5Me5)2Ln(THF)2 (Ln = Sm, Yb), (C5Me5)Sm(OAr)(HMPA)2, Sm(N(SiMe3)2)2(THF)2, and Ln/HMPA (Ln = Sm, Yb) (HMPA = hexamethylphosphoric triamide). Reactions of 1a\xe2\x88\x92d with 1 equiv of fluorenone in THF afforded the corresponding ketyl complexes Ln(OAr)2(ketyl)(L)2 (3a\xe2\x88\x92d) in 85\xe2\x88\x9290% isolated yields. Hydrolysis of 3a (Ln = Sm, L = THF) gave the corresponding pinacol-coupling product, 1,2-bis(biphenyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-diyl)ethane-1,2-diol (4), while air oxidation of 3a yielded fluorenone almost quantitatively. Reaction of 3a with 1 equiv of 1a followed by hydrolysis afforded fluorenol quantitatively. When 3a was dissolved in hexane/ether, pinacol-coupling of the ketyl unit occurred to give the OEt2-coordinated pinacolate complex [Sm(OAr)2(OEt2)]2[\xce\xbc-pinacolate] (5a, pinacolate = 1,2-bis(biphenyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-diyl)ethane-1,2-diolate). Dissolving 5a in THF regenerated 3a via C\xe2\x88\x92C bond cleavage of the pinacolate unit, showing that the pinacol-coupling process was reversible. Addition of 2 equiv of HMPA (per Sm) to a THF solution of 3a or 5a gave the corresponding HMPA-coordinated ketyl complex 3c. Complex 3c was more stable than 3a, and no reaction was observed when 3c was treated similarly with hexane/ether. Reactions of fluorenone with (C5Me5)2Ln(THF)2 (Ln = Sm, Yb) and (C5Me5)Sm(OAr)(HMPA)2 gave the corresponding ketyl complexes (C5Me5)2Ln(ketyl)(THF) (3e:\xe2\x80\x89 Ln = Sm, 3f:\xe2\x80\x89 Ln = Yb) and (C5Me5)Sm(OAr)(ketyl)(HMPA) (3i), respectively. In contrast, the similar reaction of Sm(N(SiMe3)2)2(THF)2 with fluorenone in THF yielded the pinacolate complex [Sm(N(SiMe3)2)2(THF)]2[\xce\xbc-pinacolate] (5b) as the only isolable product, although the formation of a ketyl species was evident in THF solution. Reaction of 4 equiv of HMPA with 5b in THF gave a mixture of Sm(N(SiMe3)2)2(ketyl)(HMPA)2 (3k) and [Sm(N(SiMe3)2)2(HMPA)]2[\xce\xbc-pinacolate] (5c), while reactions of 5b with 4 equiv of ArOH (Ar = C6H2-tBu2-2,6-Me-4) in THF and THF/HMPA produced the corresponding ArO-ligated ketyl complexes 3a and 3c, respectively. A variable-temperature UV\xe2\x88\x92vis spectroscopic study in toluene derived a dissociation enthalpy of 11 kcal/mol for 5b. Reactions of metallic Ln (Ln = Sm, Yb) with 3 equiv of fluorenone and 3 equiv of HMPA in THF yielded the corresponding tris(ketyl)metal complexes Ln(ketyl)3(HMPA)3 (7a:\xe2\x80\x89 Ln = Sm, 7b:\xe2\x80\x89 Ln = Yb). Hydrolysis of 7a,b afforded the pinacol 4, while reaction of 7a with 0.5 equiv of 4 or benzopinacol produced the fluorenoxide/pinacolate complex 6. Reaction of 4 with Sm(N(SiMe3)2)3 in THF/HMPA also afforded 6. In contrast to the reactions of fluorenone, the similar reactions of the above reducing agents with benzophenone did not afford a structurally characterizable ketyl species, and in the case of 1d, the corresponding hydrogen radical abstraction product Yb(OCHPh2)2(OAr)(HMPA)2 (2) was isolated.

"The surface structure of vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) and its changes upon controlled oxidation and reduction have been investigated comprehensively by means of Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetry (TG), EXAFS, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron diffraction (TED), and \xe2\x80\x9cmicropulse\xe2\x80\x9d reaction of n-butane.

Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1985, 58, 2163\xe2\x88\x922171) and similar to \xce\xb4-VOPO4. By the repeated micropulse reactions of n-butane, the surface X1 phase was gradually reduced back to (VO)2P2O7, showing that reversible redox reactions between X1 phase and (VO)2P2O7 occur by the reactions with butane and oxygen. XRD, EXAFS, and TED demonstrated that X1 phase has a structure analogous to (VO)2P2O7, in both of which V\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92V pair sites exist. The micropulse reaction of n-butane with the surface X1 phase produced maleic anhydride with a significantly higher selectivity (\xe2\x88\xbc40%) than that with \xce\xb2-VOPO4 (<10%). These results indicate that X1 phase is the real active phase involved in the redox cycle for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride over (VO)2P2O7. "
"The oxidation reactions of ethylene, propene, dimethyl sulfide, trimethylamine, and trimethylphosphine with peroxynitrous acid have been studied computationally with the B3LYP, MP2, MP4, CISD, QCISD, and QCISD(T) levels of theory. The activation barriers for the alkene (ethylene and propene) epoxidations (18.4 and 15.5 kcal/mol at the QCISD(T)/6-31G*//QCISD/6-31G* level, respectively) and for the oxidations of dimethyl sulfide, trimethylamine, and trimethylphosphine (8.3, 4.6, and 0.5 kcal/mol at the QCISD(T)/6-31G*//B3LYP/6-311G** level, respectively) with peroxynitrous acid are similar to the barriers of their oxidations with peroxyformic acid and dimethyldioxirane, although these peroxides have very diverse O\xe2\x88\x92O bond dissociation energies. Therefore, the feasibility of alkene epoxidation and the oxidations of methyl-substituted sulfides, amines, and phosphines by peroxynitrous acid should not differ significantly from those for peroxyformic acid and dimethyldioxirane. The transition structures for the epoxidation of ethylene and propene with peroxynitrous acid are symmetrical with equal or almost equal bond distances between the spiro oxygen and the carbons of the double bond. This symmetrical approach of the electrophilic oxygen is similar to that found for alkene epoxidations with peroxyformic acid. The geometries of the transition structures calculated at the QCISD and CISD levels are quite comparable to each other. The B3LYP calculated barriers for oxidations of alkenes, as well as sulfides, amines, and phosphines, are underestimated when compared with those calculated at the QCISD(T)//QCISD levels. The most economical and accurate protocol utilizes the B3LYP (for such \xe2\x80\x9c\xcf\x83-donors\xe2\x80\x9d as sulfides, amines, and phosphines) or CISD geometries with barriers calculated at the QCISD(T) level.

"The interaction of xenon with cryptophane-A in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d2 is investigated by 129Xe and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Xenon is reversibly trapped into the cavity of this host to form a 1 to 1 host\xe2\x88\x92guest complex with an apparent association constant K of the order of at least 3 \xc3\x97 103 M-1 at 278 K. The exchange between the free and bound xenon is slow on the 129Xe NMR time scale, and the bound xenon resonance is shifted by approximately 160 ppm to lower frequencies with respect to the free xenon resonance. The xenon complex is at least 4 and 20 times more stable, respectively, than the corresponding chloroform and methane complexes under the same conditions. The stability of this xenon complex appears to be much greater than that of the previously described xenon complex of \xce\xb1-cyclodextrin in water. This is probably due to the combination of three favorable effects:\xe2\x80\x89 (i) good size matching between the guest and the cryptophane cavity in its most relaxed conformation, resulting in the optimization of the London forces between the highly polarizable guest and the electron rich aromatic rings of the host (enthalpic stabilization); (ii) no rotational or vibrational entropy loss of the monatomic guest in the cryptophane cavity; and (iii) no (or little) entropy loss due to reduction of the conformational freedom of the host. Analysis of the line widths of the signals corresponding to the free and bound xenon as a function of the relative xenon/cryptophane ratio suggests that the incoming xenon atom must displace the departing one to enter the cryptophane cavity, and that the empty cryptophane is not involved in the complexation equilibrium.

"A series of hydrophobic peptides K2(LA)x (x = 6, 8, 10, 12) has been synthesized. IR and CD studies in MeOH solution are reported, along with IR studies of these species in vesicles with 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, and IR Reflection\xe2\x88\x92Absorption Spectroscopy (IRRAS) studies of peptide and lipid/peptide monolayer films in situ at the air/water interface. In bulk phases, the propensity toward helix formation increases with increasing chain length, there being essentially no helix in the shortest peptide, varying and concentration-dependent helical content in K2(LA)8, and >90% helix formation in both K2(LA)10 and K2(LA)12. In monolayers at the air/water interface, peptide secondary structure was inferred from both the Amide I and Amide A bands. The shortest peptide adopted an antiparallel \xce\xb2-sheet structure, while the remainder of the series (when spread at low surface pressure) appeared to adopt varying proportions of parallel \xce\xb2-sheet forms. The secondary structure adopted by K2(LA)10 and K2(LA)12 depended remarkably on the initial spreading pressure; when spread at high pressures, the molecules were \xce\xb1-helical. The current experiments demonstrate the unique advantages of IRRAS for evaluation of peptide conformations in situ at the air/water interface and reveal large differences in the propensity for helix formation in monolayers compared with bulk phases.

"A methodology for analyzing nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) data of interconverting microstates of a peptide has been suggested recently, which is based on pure statistical mechanical considerations. Thus, the most stable microstates and their populations are determined from the free energies. The success of this approach depends on the existence of a reliable potential energy function for the solvated peptide, in which the solvent is treated implicitly. Such a potential is developed here based on the stable structures of the cyclic hexapeptide cyclo(d-Pro1-Phe2-Ala3-Ser4-Phe5-Phe6) in DMSO obtained by Kessler et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 4805\xe2\x88\x924818) from NOE distance constraints. This study suggests that two different backbone motifs coexist in equilibrium, one with a \xce\xb2I turn and the other with a \xce\xb2II turn around Ser4-Phe5. We have first reconfirmed these findings by a best-fit analysis applied to a large set of energy-minimized structures generated by our \xe2\x80\x9clocal torsional deformations\xe2\x80\x9d (LTD) method, using the GROMOS force field with and without NOE distance restraints. However, the GROMOS energy EGRO, which excludes solvent interactions was found inappropriate to describe this system because the lowest energy structures representing the \xce\xb2I and \xce\xb2II motifs are \xe2\x88\xbc15 and 5 kcal/mol above the global energy minimum, respectively. Solvent effects are taken into account through Etot = EGRO + \xe2\x88\x91Ai\xcf\x83i, where Ai is the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of atom i and \xcf\x83i is the atomic solvation parameter (ASP). We optimize the ASPs for DMSO by requiring that the Etot values of \xce\xb2I and \xce\xb2II structures become the lowest globally; this is verified by an extensive application of LTD. The set of ASPs obtained here will be refined in the next work where free energy (rather than energy) considerations will be taken into account. This solvation model, which is relatively easy to handle, requires significantly less computer time than explicit models of solvation and can readily be used in structural analysis of experimental data using GROMOS. The proposed derivation opens the way for the development of similar solvation models for peptides in other solvents. ASPs for proteins in water can be obtained by applying our methodology to surface loops in proteins. Preliminary results for the ASPs, which are slightly different from the present values, were published in a recent Letter (J. Phys. Chem. B 1997, 101, 7368\xe2\x88\x927370). "
"The assembly of the essential diferric cluster/tyrosyl radical cofactor of the R2 subunit of Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase from apoR2 with Fe2+ and O2 or diferrous R2 with O2 has been studied by a variety of rapid kinetic methods. An intermediate X, formally an Fe3+/Fe4+ diiron cluster, oxidizes tyrosine 122 to the tyrosyl radical concomitant with its own reduction to the diferric cluster generating the R2 cofactor. To characterize the properties of X, rapid freeze quench methods have been used in conjunction with M\xc3\xb6ssbauer, ENDOR, and EPR spectroscopies. These studies are extended here to include rapid freeze quench EXAFS. A short, 2.5 \xc3\x85 Fe\xe2\x88\x92Fe vector and a 1.8 \xc3\x85 Fe\xe2\x88\x92O interaction have been identified in nine independent samples of X. These samples have been generated using both wild-type and a mutant protein in which the essential tyrosine has been replaced by phenylalanine (Y122F). The short Fe\xe2\x88\x92Fe interaction is neither present in diferrous or diferric R2 nor in samples of X that have aged to decay the intermediate. Several structural models which are consistent with the data are presented. "
"The hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus contains a novel ferredoxin (Pf-Fd) in which, in the native 4Fe form, three of the Fe ions are coordinated to the protein by cysteinyl thiolato ligands, but the fourth, labile, Fe is coordinated by an aspartyl carboxalato ligand. Addition of excess cyanide ion to the reduced 4Fe protein, Pf-Fd 4Fe-red, yields a species with EPR properties that differ greatly from the native cluster form (Pf-Fd 4Fe\xe2\x88\x92CN). The unique Fe can be removed, to form a 3Fe cluster, which in turn can be reconstituted to regenerate the 4Fe form. The lability of this fourth Fe allows the preparation of a series of 57Fe cluster isotopologs:\xe2\x80\x89 Pf-Fd 3Fe-ox (S = 1/2) as [Fe3S4]+ and [57Fe3S4]+; Pf-Fd 4Fe-red as [Fe4S4]+, [57FeFe3S4]+, and [Fe57Fe3S4]+ as well as the corresponding 57Fe isotopologs of Pf-Fd 4Fe\xe2\x88\x92CN. The 3Fe and 4Fe cluster-containing native and cyanide-bound forms all have been investigated by 57Fe ENDOR spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures. The ground state of Pf-Fd 3Fe-ox is similar to that seen for other 3Fe Fd\'s but shows evidence of less symmetrical intracluster spin-coupling. The theoretical framework created by earlier studies, particularly those of Noodleman and co-workers (Mouesca, J.-M.; Noodleman, L.; Case, D. A.; Lamotte, B. Inorg. Chem. 1995, 34, 4347\xe2\x88\x924359), allows us to use 57Fe ENDOR data alone to characterize the spin-coupling within both the native and cyanide-bound S =1/2 forms of Pf-Fd 4Fe-red. This procedure shows that cyanide binding to the unique Fe ion causes it to undergo a \xe2\x80\x9cvalency switch\xe2\x80\x9d from Fe2.5+ to Fe2+. The interchange also is detected by NMR analysis (Calzolai et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 9341\xe2\x88\x929350). We find that the cyanide-bound cluster has a spin state common to many [Fe4S4]+ clusters, whereas the native form may exhibit a previously unidentified spin-coupling ground state. "
"The intermolecular primary deuterium isotope effects on the individual C\xe2\x88\x92H bond cleavage steps involved in linoleic acid biosynthesis were determined using a suitably transformed strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing a functional oleate \xce\x9412 desaturase from Arabidopsis thaliana. Mass spectral analysis of the methyl 7-thialinoleate fraction obtained from competition experiments involving methyl 7-thiastearate, methyl [12,12-2H2]-7-thiastearate and methyl [13,13-2H2]-7-thiastearate showed that cleavage of the C12\xe2\x88\x92H bond is very sensitive to isotopic substitution (kH/kD = 7.3 \xc2\xb1 0.4) while a negligible isotope effect (kH/kD = 1.05 \xc2\xb1 0.04) was observed for the C13\xe2\x88\x92H bond breaking step. This result strongly suggests that the site of initial oxidation for \xce\x9412 desaturation is at C-12. The possible relationship between castor oleate 12-hydroxylase and microsomal \xce\x9412 oleate desaturases is discussed in the context of a common mechanistic paradigm. Our methodology may be also be useful in deciphering the cryptoregiochemistry of other desaturase systems. "
"The absolute configuration of a secondary alcohol can be deduced from the 1H NMR spectra of a single methoxyphenylacetic ester derivative [MPA, either the (R) or the (S)] recorded at two different temperatures. This new approach simplifies the current NMR-based methodologies, requiring just one derivatizing reaction, instead of two, and, correspondingly, half of the usual amount of sample. At low temperature, the relative population of the most stable sp conformer is increased and the resonances of the substituents of the alcohol (L1/L2), located under the shielding cone of the phenyl ring, are shifted upfield. At the same time, those protons under the shielding cone in the less populated ap conformer are shifted downfield. In this way, the spatial location of L1/L2 around the asymmetric center of the alcohol can be established comparing the 1H NMR spectra both at room and low temperatures. Application of this finding to alcohols of known absolute configuration, including complex structures such as cis-androsterone, is presented. "
"The substrate specificity in solvolysis reactions of p-nitrophenyl alkanoates 2 (n = 2\xe2\x88\x9218) catalyzed by 4-(dialkylamino)pyridine-functionalized polymer 1 can be controlled by the concentration of 1 in 50:50 (v/v) methanol\xe2\x88\x92aqueous phosphate buffer solution at pH 8.0 and 30 \xc2\xb0C. Below 1.0 \xc3\x97 10-5 unit mol L-1, macromolecule 1 exhibits substrate specificity for 2 (n =14). As the concentration of 1 increases to 2.5 \xc3\x97 10-5 unit mol L-1, the substrate preference changes from 2 (n = 14) to 2 (n = 12). The substrate specificity changes again from 2 (n = 12) to 2 (n = 10) when the concentration of 1 increases further to 7.5 \xc3\x97 10-5 unit mol L-1. The control of substrate specificity by polymer catalyst concentration is believed to be unprecedented for catalysis of ester solvolysis. "
"Mechanistic aspects of palladium-catalyzed insertion copolymerizations of ethylene and \xce\xb1-olefins with methyl acrylate to give high molar mass polymers are described.

The copolymers are highly branched, the acrylate comonomer being incorporated predominantly at the ends of branches as \xe2\x88\x92CH2CH2C(O)OMe groups. The effects of reaction conditions and catalyst structure on the copolymerization reaction are rationalized. Low-temperature NMR studies show that migratory insertion in the \xce\xb72-methyl acrylate (MA) complex [(N\xe2\x88\xa7N)PdMe{H2CCHC(O)OMe}]+ (5) occurs to give initially the 2,1-insertion product [(N\xe2\x88\xa7N)PdCH(CH2CH3)C(O)OMe]+ (6), which rearranges stepwise to yield 2 as the final product upon warming to \xe2\x88\x9220 \xc2\xb0C. Activation parameters (\xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 12.1 \xc2\xb1 1.4 kcal/mol and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 = \xe2\x88\x9214.1 \xc2\xb1 7.0 eu) were determined for the conversion of 5a to 6a. Rates of ethylene homopolymerization observed in preparative-scale polymerizations (1.2 s-1 at 25 \xc2\xb0C, \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 17.4 kcal/mol for 2b) correspond well with low-temperature NMR kinetic data for migratory insertion of ethylene in [(N\xe2\x88\xa7N)Pd{(CH2)2nMe}(H2CCH2)]+. Relative binding affinities of olefins to the metal center were also studied. For [(N\xe2\x88\xa7N)PdMe(H2CCH2)]+ + MA \xe2\x87\x8c 5a + H2CCH2, Keq(\xe2\x88\x9295 \xc2\xb0C) = (1.0 \xc2\xb1 0.3) \xc3\x97 10-6 was determined. Combination of the above studies provides a mechanistic model that agrees well with acrylate incorporations observed in copolymerization experiments. Data obtained for equilibria 2 + H2CCHR\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 \xe2\x87\x8c [(N\xe2\x88\xa7N)Pd{(CH2)3C(O)OMe}(H2CCHR\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98)]+ (R\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 \xe2\x8b\xae H, Me, nC4H9) shows that chelating coordination of the carbonyl group is favored over olefin coordination at room temperature. Formation of chelates analogous to 2 during the copolymerization is assumed to render the subsequent monomer insertion a turnover-limiting step. "
"The kinetics of the reactions of dicobalt-coordinated propargyl cations with \xcf\x80-nucleophiles (e.g., allylsilanes) and hydride donors (e.g., trialkylsilanes) have been studied conductometrically and/or photometrically. The reactions follow second-order kinetics with rate-determining CC-bond formation or hydride transfer. It is found that phenyl and trimethylsilyl substituents in the propargyl cation moiety reduce the electrophilic reactivities of these cations by less than a factor of 10. The electrophilicity is reduced by a factor of more than 105, however, when one CO ligand is replaced by PPh3 (3a \xe2\x86\x92 3e). The reactions of the dicobalt-coordinated propargyl cations with allylsilanes and -stannanes, silylated enol ethers and ketene actetals, and hydride donors (R3SiH, R3SnH) follow the linear free enthalpy relationship log k = s(E + N), which allows one to calculate electrophilicity parameters E for these carbocations and to rationalize their synthetic potential.

"Unambiguous synthetic routes to sphingofungins B and F and to their stereoisomers have been developed based on the tin(II)-catalyzed asymmetric aldol reaction (Chiral Lewis Acid-Controlled Synthesis (CLAC Synthesis)). Efficient enantioselective synthesis using a catalytic amount of a chiral source as well as the effectiveness of this strategy for the synthesis of the sphingofungin family have been successfully demonstrated. Using the stereoisomers of sphingofungin B synthesized, the relevance of its stereochemistry to its SPT inhibitory activity has been revealed. "
"The self-assembly and characterization of a range of chiral pseudorotaxanes has been explored using chiroptical methods. The syntheses of (i) constitutionally asymmetric acyclic hydroquinone-containing polyethers and (ii) optically active hydroquinone-containing acyclic polyethers, bearing pairs of methyl or isobutyl groups related to each other in a C2-symmetric manner within the polyether backbone, are described. The combination of (i) the tetracationic cyclophane cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) tetrakis(hexafluorophosphate), possessing a \xcf\x80-electron deficient cavity, and (ii) the linear noncentrosymmetric acyclic polyethers produces [2]pseudorotaxanes that have been characterized by 1H NMR, UV/vis and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies in solution and by X-ray crystallography in the solid state. The introduction of constitutional asymmetry or chirality gives rise to a number of different geometries for the [2]pseudorotaxanes in both the solution and solid states. In particular, CD-spectroscopic measurements on the optically active [2]pseudorotaxanes have shown thatdepending on the positions of the C2 symmetrically related chiral centers in the polyether chains with respect to the hydroquinone ringsthe chirality present in the \xcf\x80-electron rich threadlike guest can induce chirality that is associated with the supramolecular structure as a whole, resulting in a chiral charge-transfer transition involving not only the \xcf\x80-donors in the chiral guests but also the \xcf\x80-acceptors in the achiral host.

"Zinc amalgam reduction of tris(acetylacetonato)ruthenium(III), [Ru(acac)3], in the presence of the chelating olefinic N- and O-donor ligands (LL\xe2\x80\x98) 2-vinyl-N,N-dimethylaniline, o-CH2CHC6H4NMe2 (1), 2-isopropenyl-N,N-dimethylaniline, o-CH2C(CH3)C6H4NMe2 (2), 3-butenyldimethylamine, CH2CHCH2CH2NMe2 (3), 2-allylpyridine, CH2CHCH2C5H4N (4), isomesityl oxide (4-methyl-4-penten-2-one), CH2C(CH3)CH2COCH3 (5), 2-methoxystyrene, o-CH2CHC6H4OMe (6), and 3-butenylmethyl ether, CH2CHCH2CH2OCH3 (7) gives the corresponding bis(acetylacetonato)ruthenium(II) complexes [Ru(acac)2(LL\xe2\x80\x98)] (8\xe2\x88\x9214). These undergo one-electron oxidation by cyclic voltammetry to the corresponding cations [Ru(acac)2(LL\xe2\x80\x98)]+, the process being reversible at both room temperature and \xe2\x88\x9260 \xc2\xb0C. The cations were isolated as deep blue, paramagnetic PF6 or SbF6 salts from the oxidation of the ruthenium(II) precursors 8\xe2\x88\x9212 and 14 with Ag+ or [FeCp2]+ salts; they are the first stable alkene complexes of ruthenium(III). At both oxidation levels, coordination of the prochiral alkene gives rise to a pair of diastereomers, labeled a, b at the Ru(II) level, a+, b+ at the Ru(III) level, whose redox potentials E1/2 (Ru3+/2+) differ by ca. 100 mV. The equilibrium a/b ratio at the Ru(II) level is ca. 1:9, although for 8, 10, and 11 this is established only after several hours at ca. 100 \xc2\xb0C, the ratio in the complexes immediately after isolation being ca. 2:3. Selective removal of the more easily oxidized diastereomer of the 2-vinyl-N,N-dimethylaniline complex 8a by treatment of a 2:3 mixture with ca. 0.5 equiv of Ag+ provides pure 8b, which undergoes reversible one-electron oxidation at \xe2\x88\x9260 \xc2\xb0C to 8b+. Above \xe2\x88\x9210 \xc2\xb0C, 8b+ isomerizes to an equilibrium mixture (ca. 85:15) of 8a+ and 8b+, as shown by UV\xe2\x88\x92visible spectroelectrochemistry. Thus, both diastereomeric preference and rate of interconversion are strongly dependent on the oxidation state (number of metal d-electrons). The metrical parameters pertaining to alkene coordination in the diastereomers 8a and 8b do not differ significantly, the metal\xe2\x88\x92carbon distances being 2.159(4), 2.144(4) \xc3\x85 (8a), 2.142(2), 2.153(3) \xc3\x85 (8b) and the CC distances being 1.383(5) \xc3\x85 (8a) and 1.382(4) \xc3\x85 (8b). The corresponding distances in the Ru(III) complex [8a]+[SbF6]- [Ru\xe2\x88\x92C = 2.239(6), 2.236(7) \xc3\x85; CC = 1.355(9) \xc3\x85] indicate that the alkene is more weakly bound than in either of its diastereomeric Ru(II) precursors.

"The anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants for a 19-electron organometallic complex, CpCo(CO)2-, were calculated using the B3LYP density functional in conjunction with several all-electron basis sets. The calculated hfc constants are generally within 10% of the experimental values as determined by EPR. The calculated wave function indicates that the unpaired electron has a much lower occupancy of the cobalt dyz orbital (0.17\xe2\x88\x920.31) than the value of 0.56 obtained from the EPR data. It is concluded that the traditional method of calculating atomic orbital spin populations from EPR hyperfine coupling constants, which neglects spin polarization and covalency effects, should be used with caution when applied to organometallic systems. No significant structural changes occur in the ligands of CpCo(CO)2- as a result of having to accommodate an extra electron. "
"Enantioselectivity in the (salen)Mn-catalyzed asymmetric epoxidation reaction correlates directly with the electronic properties of the ligand substituents, with complexes bearing electron-donating substituents affording highest ee\'s. Several lines of evidence point to a single factorcontrol of the position of the transition state along the reaction coordinateas being responsible for the electronic effects on enantioselectivity. Analysis of the epoxidation of cis-\xce\xb2-deuteriostyrene reveals that electron-rich catalysts display a more pronounced secondary inverse isotope effect than electron-deficient catalysts. A strong correlation between \xce\x94\xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 and the electronic character of the catalyst is also observed. The conclusion that enantioselectivity is tied to the position of a transition state along the reaction coordinate may hold general implications for the design of asymmetric catalysts, particularly those that effect reactions without substrate precoordination.

"We report the resonance Raman (RR) spectra of iron complexes containing the Fe2(\xce\xbc-O)2 core. Frozen CH3CN solutions of the FeIIIFeIV intermediate [Fe2(\xce\xbc-O)2L2](ClO4)3 (where L = TPA, 5-Me3-TPA, 5-Me2-TPA, 5-MeTPA, 5-Et3-TPA, or 3-Me3-TPA) show numerous resonance-enhanced vibrations, and among these, an oxygen-isotope-sensitive vibration around 667 cm-1 that shifts ca. 30 cm-1 when the samples are allowed to exchange with 18OH2, and whose Raman shift does not vary with methyl substitution of the TPA ligand. Spectra of iron-isotope-substituted samples of [Fe2(\xce\xbc-O)2(L)2](ClO4)3 (54Fe and 57Fe for L = TPA, and 54Fe and 58Fe for L = 5-Me3-TPA) show that this vibration is also iron-isotope-sensitive. These isotopic data taken together strongly suggest that this vibration involves motion of the Fe2(\xce\xbc-O)2 core that is isolated from motions of the ligand. A frozen CH3CN solution of the diiron(III) complex [Fe2(\xce\xbc-O)2(6-Me3-TPA)2](ClO4)2 shows one intense resonance-enhanced vibration at 692 cm-1 that shifts \xe2\x88\x9230 cm-1 with 18O labeling. Normal coordinate analysis of the Fe2(\xce\xbc-O)2 core in [Fe2(\xce\xbc-O)2(5-Me3-TPA)2](ClO4)3 supports the assignment of the Fermi doublet centered around 666.2 cm-1 as an A1 vibration of this core. Furthermore, we propose that this unique feature found in the region between 650 and 700 cm-1 is indicative of a diamond core structure and is the Raman signature of an iron cluster containing this core.

"The quantitative description of the facial discrimination in molecules containing a prochiral group oriented in a polypeptide liquid crystalline system is reported. From the analysis of proton, carbon-13, and deuterium NMR spectra of ethanol dissolved in an organic solution of poly-\xce\xb3-(benzyl-l-glutamate) (PBLG), the full molecular order matrix and the principal axis system were determined. It is shown that five nonzero independent order parameters are necessary to describe correctly the molecular ordering of ethanol in this medium, which clearly demonstrates that in this chiral liquid crystal, the symmetry of the ordering in a prochiral molecule is broken. Due to the nonequivalence in terms of the dipolar couplings of the two enantiotopic protons of ethanol, it is possible to determine the sign and the magnitude of geminal scalar couplings between them. This new approach to obtain the geminal 2JHH constants is tested on a series of linear alcohols and compared to values derived from 2JHD of the same molecules by the isotopic substitution method. "
"One- and two-dimensional 19F high-speed MAS NMR are used to probe motion of the fluorine sublattices in the fluoride-ion conductors \xce\xb1 PbF2 and potassium fluoride-doped \xce\xb1 PbF2. The two crystallographic sites F(1) and F(2) are resolved in the 19F spectrum of the pure material and are assigned on the basis of their 207Pb\xe2\x88\x9219F J-coupling. A resonance from fluoride-ions jumping rapidly between the two sites is also observed above 120 \xc2\xb0C, which increases in intensity as the temperature is raised. The resonance from the mobile fluoride-ions is observed at room temperature for the \xce\xb1 PbF2 sample containing potassium impurities and for samples that have been intentionally doped with KF by direct reaction of KF and PbF2. The correlation times of the rigid and mobile fluoride-ions in these samples differ by more than 2 orders of magnitude, and 2-D magnetization exchange methods show that the exchange between these two sets of fluoride-ions is negligible. The vacancies produced by potassium doping appear to remain closely associated with the potassium defects at low temperatures, and the mobile fluoride-ions at these temperatures are assigned to fluoride-ions near the potassium defects. In contrast, in the pure, or more uniformly potassium-doped, materials, the vacancies are more uniformly distributed over the solid, resulting in spectra with a narrower range of correlation times for fluoride-ion motion. Finally, a low activation energy conduction pathway between F(1) and F(2) sites along the y-axis is proposed to rationalize the rapid F(1)\xe2\x86\x94F(2) fluoride-ion diffusion. "
"The orientation of the principal axes of the g tensor with respect to the relationship of axial ligand planes to the porphyrin nitrogens has been studied in the framework of the one-electron crystal field model for tetragonal and rhombic low-spin d5 complexes such as ferriheme centers. All five d atomic orbitals were taken into account for two different ground-state electronic configurations, the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d (dxy)2(dxz,dyz)3 and the \xe2\x80\x9cnovel\xe2\x80\x9d (dxz,dyz)4(dxy)1 configurations. The expressions for the g tensor, g values, and magnetic axes were derived on the basis of first-order perturbation theory. The conditions for co- and counterrotation of magnetic axes with rotation of planar axial ligands away from the porphyrin nitrogens toward the meso positions and beyond, as well as the order of g values, have been analyzed. It is found that counterrotation is the only possibility for the (dxz,dyz)4(dxy)1 configuration and that it is also by far more common for the (dxy)2(dxz,dyz)3 electron configuration. The possibilities of nonlinear co-/counterrotation are also explored. The predictions of this treatment are then compared to experimental results obtained from single-crystal EPR, glassy sample ESEEM, and solution NMR spectroscopic studies. It is clear that the majority of experimental systems reported thus far follow the major predictions of this treatment:\xe2\x80\x89 Most systems exhibit angle-for-angle (linear) counterrotation of the g or \xcf\x87 tensor with rotation of planar axial ligands away for the N\xe2\x88\x92Fe\xe2\x88\x92N axes. Hence, knowing the structure of a model heme or heme protein, and in particular, the orientation of (fixed) axial ligand planes, one should be able to predict the approximate orientation of the in-plane magnetic axes. This knowledge provides a check on the values obtained in new solution NMR, single-crystal EPR or frozen solution ESEEM experiments. "
"The proton sum frequency peak(s), I(\xce\xbd+), in the ESEEM spectra of low-spin ferriheme complexes provide single-crystal-like information concerning the orientation of the g tensor in samples in frozen glassy media. In this work we have investigated two model heme complexes, [OEPFe(imidazole)2]+ and [OEPFe(4-(dimethylamino)pyridine)2]+ (OEP = octaethylporphyrinate). Both experimental intensities and frequency shifts from twice the 1H Larmor frequency of the observed signals were measured at various points across the EPR spectrum and compared to the expected spectra, simulated using the known crystal structure data, isotropic hyperfine coupling constants, and g strain. In each case the z magnetic axis direction was defined as perpendicular to the mean plane of the porphyrinate, and it was found that gzz is the largest g value in both cases. The in-plane magnetic axis directions could also be determined from the ESEEM data, and it was found that the orientations of gxx and gyy differ, depending on the orientation of the (parallel) axial ligands with respect to the porphyrinate nitrogens:\xe2\x80\x89 For the bis(imidazole) complex, for which the axial ligands nearly eclipse opposite porphyrinate nitrogens (\xcf\x86 = 7\xc2\xb0) in the crystalline state, gxx and gyy are aligned at \xc2\xb145\xc2\xb0 to the normal to the plane of the axial ligands, while for the bis(4-(dimethylamino)pyridine) complex, for which the axial ligands lie in parallel planes nearly bisecting the porphyrinate nitrogens (\xcf\x86 = 41\xc2\xb0) in the crystalline state, gyy is aligned along the plane of the axial ligands. The significance of these results with respect to the concept of counterrotation of the g tensor with rotation of axial ligands and the interpretation of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy of heme proteins measured by NMR techniques is discussed.

"This paper reports theoretical gas-phase structures and energetics using G2(MP2) theory for saturated oxygen chains of the general formula HOnH. Structural trends are discussed using a simple hyperconjugation model which is capable of giving a qualitative explanation for trends in bond lengths and dihedral angles. Bond dissociation energies (BDEs) are calculated for chains of increasing length, giving 49.9, 33.9, and 17.8 kcal/mol for H2O2, H2O3, and H2O4, respectively. From an analysis of the radical stabilization energy of the fragments remaining after dissociation, it is shown that a minimum value for the BDE for any hydrogen polyoxide is 6.4 kcal/mol, which occurs for the center bond in H2O6, and that longer chains will have a higher BDE. Decomposition pathways responsible for the observed instability of the polyoxides higher than hydrogen peroxide are discussed and results are given for three low-barrier dissociation paths:\xe2\x80\x89 a solvent-assisted path, a base-catalyzed path, and a proton relay mechanism. These mechanisms are probably general and account for the instability of polyoxide chains in proton-containing solvents. Preventing proton transfer, e.g. by perfluoroalkylation, would therefore be expected to increase chain stability, in agreement with experimental observations. "
"Donor (D)\xe2\x88\x92acceptor (A) compounds containing aromatic amine as an electron donor and acridine as an acceptor show a low-energy CT absorption band which undergoes a red shift with increasing solvent polarity. Solvatochromic effects on the spectral position and profile of the stationary fluorescence spectra clearly indicate the CT character of the emitting singlet states of all the compounds studied. A band-shape analysis of the CT absorption and emission spectra leads to the quantities relevant for the electron transfer in the Marcus inverted region. The comparative determination of the electronic transition dipole moments corresponding to the 1CT \xe2\x86\x90 S0 absorption and the radiative charge recombination 1CT \xe2\x86\x92 S0 (Mabs and Mflu, respectively) made possible the estimation at the electronic coupling elements V0 and V1 between the 1CT state and the ground state S0 or the locally excited 1LE state lying most closely in energy, respectively. To describe the properties of the excited 1CT state of aryl derivatives of aromatic amines, the significant contributions of both of the above interactions together with the solvent induced changes of V0 and V1 have to be taken into account. In low polarity solvents the conformation of these compounds in the fluorescent 1CT(f) state is more planar than that in the ground state (and in the unrelaxed Franck\xe2\x88\x92Condon 1CT(a) excited state), whereas in highly polar environment the compounds do not undergo any significant conformational changes accompanying the excited-state charge separation. The experimental and computational results led us to propose a simple model which allows one to predict the photophysical behavior of a particular D\xe2\x88\x92A compound from the properties of its donor and acceptor moieties.

"Q-band electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) has measured anisotropic, distance-dependent dipolar hyperfine couplings from iron in ferric bleomycin [Fe(III)-BLM] and in activated bleomycin [Act-BLM] to 31P of substrate DNA. Studies were focused on bleomycin complexes with a self-complementary duplex DNA 10-mer, d(GGAAGCTTCC)2, containing a 5\xe2\x80\x98-G-C-3\xe2\x80\x98 sequence that is selective for bleomycin cleavage (Mao, Q.; Fulmer, P.; Li, W.; DeRose, E. G.; Petering, D. H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996, 271, 6185\xe2\x88\x926191). Bleomycin complexes with high molecular weight calf thymus DNA were also used. Fe(III)-BLM and Act-BLM complexes with the 10-mer and the calf thymus DNA showed anisotropic 31P dipolar hyperfine couplings from which an Fe(III)-to-31P distance was estimated at 7.4 \xc2\xb1 0.2 \xc3\x85. High-resolution, angle-selected ENDOR of the Fe(III)-BLM 10-mer complex showed that the Fe(III)-to-31P vector lay at 25 \xc2\xb1 5\xc2\xb0 to the maximal g value direction, where the latter direction pointed near the exchangeable protons on axial BLM ligands and is associated with the maximal hyperfine couplings of these protons (Veselov, A.; Sun, H.; Sienkiewicz, A.; Taylor, H.; Burger, R. M.; Scholes, C. P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 7508\xe2\x88\x927512). Proton ENDOR features of the Fe(III)-BLM but not Act-BLM were perturbed by DNA substrate. In the presence of the 10-mer and the calf thymus DNA, proton ENDOR revealed distinct perturbation to the frequencies of three sets of nonexchangeable protons assigned to the BLM macrocycle and estimated to be 2.9\xe2\x88\x923.5 \xc3\x85 from Fe(III) and to the frequencies of exchangeable, axially located protons. In contrast, the hyperfine couplings of covalently bonded, first-shell nitrogen and [17O]peroxy ligands were unchanged. "
"The synthesis of cycloheptatrienyl(dipropyl)borane (2a) was accomplished via the exchange reaction of trimethyl(cycloheptatrienyl)tin (6) and dipropylchloroborane. Compound 2a was found by NMR spectroscopy to equilibrate with its valence tautomer 7-exo-(dipropylboryl)norcaradiene (2b). The equilibrium between 2a and 2b was studied in detail experimentally by variable temperature NMR and theoretically by ab initio calculations of size-reduced molecular systems (2a and 2b, with methyl instead of n-propyl groups) at the B3LYP/6-311+G*//B3LYP/6-31G* + ZPVE level. Experimentally determined thermodynamic parameters of the equilibrium (\xce\x94H = 2.4 \xc2\xb1 0.1 kcal mol-1; \xce\x94S = \xe2\x88\x925.5 \xc2\xb1 0.3 cal mol-1 K-1) and the activation barriers at 228 K (\xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7228(2a\xe2\x86\x922b) = 8.2 \xc2\xb1 0.1 kcal mol-1, \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7228(2b\xe2\x86\x922a) = 9.4 \xc2\xb1 0.1 kcal mol-1) are in reasonable agreement with the computed results (\xce\x94H = 2.0 kcal mol-1, \xce\x94S = \xe2\x88\x923.7 cal mol-1 K-1; \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7228(2a\xe2\x86\x922b) = 3.2 kcal mol-1 and \xce\x94G\xe2\xa7\xa7228(2b\xe2\x86\x922a) = 6.7 kcal mol-1). The computations also indicate that 7-endo-(dimethylboryl)norcaradiene (2c) is 7.6 kcal mol-1 less stable than the exo-isomer 2b due to more favorable overlap of the unoccupied boron 2p AO with the Walsh orbital of the three-membered ring moiety in 2b. Line shape analyses together with 2D 1H EXSY data for the equilibrating system of 2a and 2b allowed the detection of a [1,7] sigmatropic shift in 2a at temperatures above 293 K. This is confirmed by the computations identifying the [1,7] B shift to have the lowest activation enthalpy (2a, \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 18.4 kcal mol-1). In the unsymmetrical deuteriopyridine complex 9, the empty boron 2p AO interacts strongly with the nitrogen lone pair. This reduces the stabilization of the exo-norcaradiene skeleton, yielding only the \xe2\x80\x9cpure\xe2\x80\x9d cycloheptatrienyl form 9 in the NMR spectra. Both NMR data and the computations show that the rotation about the B\xe2\x88\x92C bond in 9 is hindered. "
"Relative partition coefficients between aqueous methanol and pentane of the two stereoisomers of a series of 4-tert-butylcyclohexylamines were measured by NMR. The cis isomer shows a larger partition coefficient, with a \xce\x94\xce\x94G\xc2\xb0org\xe2\x86\x92aq up to 1.4 kcal/mol. A thermodynamic cycle relates these values to a solvent dependence of the A value for conformational equilibrium of an amino substituent. The variation with stereoisomer is attributed to a greater hydrophilicity of a cyclohexylamine with an equatorial amino group, or equivalently to a greater steric bulk of an amino group whose lone pair is hydrogen bonded to water. The strong dependence on solvent inferred for ANMe2 was confirmed by direct measurement of conformer populations at low temperature. "
"The oxygen dependence of oxidase enzyme electrodes is successfully addressed through the use of carbon paste biosensors with fluorocarbon pasting liquids. Due to the high oxygen solubility in perfluorocarbons, such pasting liquids provide an internal supply of oxygen, and efficient operation of first-generation oxidase electrodes under oxygen-deficit conditions. In particular, the use of poly(chlorotrifluorethylene) (Kel-F) oil results in an identical response up to 4 \xc3\x97 10-2 M glucose, in the presence and absence of oxygen. Such oxygen independence compares favorably with that reported for mediator or wired enzyme electrodes. The internal supply of oxygen of a Kel-F/carbon paste enzyme microelectrode is not depleted over a prolonged operation under oxygen-deficient conditions. The oxygen effect upon the kinetic parameters of the immobilized enzyme is examined for a variety of pasting liquids. Such attention to the oxygen demand addresses numerous practical biosensor applications, involving low or fluctuated levels of oxygen, including in-vivo monitoring of glucose. "
"A theoretical analysis of the electron-transfer matrix element, Vab, for some cluster models intended to mimic the properties of the [NEt4][Cu2Cl4] mixed-valence compound prepared by Willet et al.1 is reported. On the basis of ab initio unrestricted Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock calculations, both Vab and the potential energy profiles versus an idealized electron-transfer reaction coordinate have been calculated for different scenarios. Our best estimate for Vab is found to be 971 cm-1 in agreement with experimental related work. The physical factors governing the amplitude of the electronic coupling as well as the shape of the energy profiles have been analyzed. It is shown that in order to account for a correct type II behavior within the Robin\xe2\x88\x92Day classification, the polarization effects induced on the cluster by the environment have to be included. The dependence of Vab on the nature of the ligands bridging the CuI\xe2\x88\x92CuII centers is discussed. Our results for a family of compounds of formula [Cl2CuIX2CuIICl2]3- (X = Cl-, OH-, SH-) show that both Vab and the energy profiles are largely dependent on the nature of X. "
"The oxidative adsorption of n-alkanethiolates (CncH2nc+1S-) at Ag(111) in aqueous and methanolic solutions containing 0.5 M NaOH has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry and in-situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Reversible adsorption of CncH2nc+1S- under active potential control in solutions containing millimolar concentrations of CncH2nc+1S- provides a means to control the deposition of n-alkanethiolate monolayers, and allows for the direct voltammetric measurement of the free energy of monolayer formation. Oxidative adsorption of short chain alkanethiolates (nc \xe2\x89\xa4 6) in aqueous 0.5 M NaOH is characterized by two voltammetric waves, demonstrating that monolayer formation involves at least two energetically distinct chemical steps. The first voltammetric wave corresponds to the reversible and rapid adsorption of CncH2nc+1S- at submonolayer coverages. The redox potential of this wave ( = \xe2\x88\x921.19 \xc2\xb1 0.02 V vs Ag/AgCl) is independent of nc, suggesting that the interactions between adsorbed molecules are minimal at low surface coverages and that the energetics of adsorption are determined primarily by the strength of the Ag(111)\xe2\x88\x92S bond. A second voltammetric wave is observed at more positive electrode potentials, corresponding to further adsorption of CncH2nc+1S- to yield a complete monolayer (\xce\x93max \xe2\x88\xbc 7.7 \xc3\x97 10-10 mol/cm2). The redox potential for the second wave, , is a function of chain length, shifting to more negative potentials with increasing nc. The dependence of on nc reflects the influence of hydrophobic interactions and intermolecular forces between the hydrocarbon chains. For nc > 6, shifts to potentials negative of , and the two voltammetric waves merge into a single wave, suggesting that the more structurally ordered monolayer is energetically favored for longer chain lengths (i.e., nc > 6). In-situ SERS is used to establish the potential-dependent adsorption isotherm of n-hexanethiolate adsorbed on roughened Ag electrodes. The potential dependence of the SERS intensities of the trans and gauche \xce\xbd(C\xe2\x88\x92S) stretching modes provides a means to monitor the structural ordering of the alkanethiolate monolayer during electrochemical deposition. The electrochemical data are used to separate the total adsorption free energy (\xce\x94Gads) into the individual contributions associated with the formation of the Ag(111)\xe2\x88\x92S bond (\xe2\x88\x9222.8 and \xe2\x88\x9216.6 kcal/mol for the low- and high-density structures, respectively) and that associated with hydrophobic interactions and intermolecular forces between hydrocarbon chains (\xe2\x88\x921.02 \xc2\xb1 0.04 kcal/mol per nc). Voltammetric data and \xce\x94Gads values are also reported for the adsorption of CncH2nc+1S- (2 \xe2\x89\xa4 nc \xe2\x89\xa4 16) onto Ag(111) from basic methanolic solutions. "
"Replacement of the phosphodiester linkages of the polyanion DNA with guanidinium linkers provides the polycation deoxyribonucleic guanidine (DNG). Molecular dynamics studies to 1120 ps of the hybrid triplex and 1420 ps of the hybrid duplex formed from octameric DNG strands d(Tg)8 with a complementary DNA oligomer strand d(Ap)8 have been carried out with water explicitly as solvent and Na+Cl- as counterions under periodic boundary conditions using the CHARMM force field and Ewald summation method. The Watson\xe2\x88\x92Crick and Hoogstein hydrogen-bonding patterns of the A/T tracts remained intact without any structural restraints for both hybrid duplex and triplex structures throughout the simulation. And for the hybrid duplex and triplex structures, both 5\xe2\x80\x98 and 3\xe2\x80\x98 ends were only partially frayed. In agreement with our previous thermodynamic study the hybrid triplex is more favorable than the hybrid duplex in the simulations. This conclusion is reached by the comparison of the extent of 5\xe2\x80\x98 end fraying and the bifurcating properties of the two systems. The structural histories of the DNG\xc2\xb7DNA\xc2\xb7DNG triplex and DNG\xc2\xb7DNA duplex were determined by examining histograms from the last 1400 ps (duplex) and 1100 ps (triplex) of the dynamics run. These include the hydrogen-bonding pattern (sequence recognition) and base pair opening occurrences, minor groove width narrowing, and tract bending for the hybrid duplex and triplex structures. The bending angle measured between the local axis vectors of the first and last helical axis segments is about 30\xc2\xb0 for the averaged structures of both hybrid duplex and Watson\xe2\x88\x92Crick portion of the hybrid triplex. Propeller twist (associated with three centered hydrogen bonding) up to \xe2\x88\x9230\xc2\xb0, native to DNA AT base pairing, was also observed for the duplex structure. The helical rise and twist parameters of the duplex structure and the duplex portion of the triplex structure assume a more B-DNA like conformation. However, the sugar pucker and other helical, axis, and base pair parameters of the two structures equilibrate at a A and B complex conformation, from base to base and base pair to base pair, which suggests a more A-DNA like overall conformation. Water spines are observed during the dynamics runs for both hybrid duplex and triplex structures in both minor and major grooves. The counterions remain in their positions through the dynamics run for the triplex system. "
"A disulfide-bridged two-stranded \xce\xb1-helical coiled-coil peptide has been designed which undergoes a random coil to \xce\xb1-helical transition at pH 7 and 20 \xc2\xb0C upon metal binding to two sites engineered into the molecule. The metal binding coiled-coil, dubbed Gla2Nx, is composed of identical 35 residue polypeptide chains based on the \xe2\x80\x9cNative\xe2\x80\x9d heptad sequence repeat QgVaGbAcLdQeKf and contains a Cys substitution for Val at position 2 to allow formation of an interchain disulfide bridge. The coiled-coil structure is destabilized in the apo form by two interhelical i to i\xe2\x80\x98 + 5 ionic repulsions between negatively charged \xce\xb3-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) side chains at position 15 of one strand and position 20 of the other strand. In contrast, the folded form is stabilized by metal binding because the metal is chelated by the Gla side chains which otherwise (in the absence of metal) repel one another. One such metal binding interaction was predicted to occur between each pair of repelling Gla side chains. Metal titration monitored indirectly by circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that folding (increased helicity) is directly correlated with addition of 2 equiv of metal ion, supporting the presence of two specific metal-binding sites. The estimated metal dissociation constant, Kd, is 0.6 \xc2\xb1 0.3 \xce\xbcM for La3+ and 0.4 \xc2\xb1 0.2 \xce\xbcM for Yb3+. In addition, Zn2+ bound with a Kd of 1.7 \xc2\xb1 0.3 \xce\xbcM but Ca2+ had a very weak affinity with a Kd of 18 \xc2\xb1 2 mM. Because folding was associated with a 2:1 ratio of metal to peptide monomer (disulfide-bridged two-stranded coiled-coil), the data suggests cooperativity occurs, so that binding of the second metal is significantly tighter than that of the first, and the measured affinity corresponds to that of the first bound metal. Metal titration monitored by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy also supported the prediction that the peptide binds two metal ions specifically and the conclusion that binding is cooperative because it showed no evidence for the existence of a singly bound intermediate. In addition, Gla2Nx displays a sharp folding transition over the range from pH 6.2 to 5.2 apparently as a result of Gla side chain carboxylate protonation. "
"To probe for free radical intermediates in the model studies for the coenzyme B12-dependent, methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA carbon-skeleton rearrangement, new models incorporating cyclopropane rings (unsubstituted 23 and 2-phenyl-substituted 28) at the 2-position were developed. The reaction of 23 or 28 with vitamin B12s gives only rearranged succinate 24 or 29, respectively, with the cyclopropyl group intact. When this reaction was carried out in EtOD/D2O, a monodeuterided product, 24-d1 or 29-d1, was obtained and the deuterium was incorporated at the 2-position. Control reactions of the 2-phenylselenylsuccinate with tri-n-butyltin hydride yielded the ring-opened 2-propanylidenesuccinate via a free radical pathway. The results suggest that the skeletal rearrangement step in the B12-catalyzed isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA occurs not by a radical pathway but by an anionic or organocobalt pathway.

"De novo protein design provides an attractive means for testing and refining the principles governing the stability and tertiary structure of proteins. We describe the NMR solution structure of a 35-residue peptide designed to form a helix\xe2\x88\x92loop\xe2\x88\x92helix that dimerizes into a four-helix bundle. Structures were calculated on the basis of 834 NMR-derived restraints including 140 long-range NOEs. With 24 restraints per residue, the structure is well determined (0.28 \xc3\x85 RMSD for backbone residues 3-33) and includes many features of the design yet adopts a novel topology that was unexpected. The forces that caused this peptide to adopt this unique fold are discussed. "
"Many uncatalyzed bromate oscillators (UBO\'s) undergo oscillations in electrochemical potential without any observable color change in a closed, stirred (batch) system. We have investigated the effects of adding a wide variety of redox indicators, including diphenylamine derivatives, azo dyestuffs, triphenylmethane derivatives, diimine chelate complexes, and methylene blue to UBO\'s. We find that in many cases the indicators make the batch oscillations strikingly visible and also allow observation of spatial pattern formation (concentric rings and spirals) in a thin, unstirred layer of solution. In some systems, the indicators act merely to make visible changes in redox potential, while in others they play an active role in the chemistry, and added indicator can lengthen the duration of oscillations or regenerate oscillations or patterns once this behavior has ceased.

"We have previously isolated, by in vitro selection, an acyl-transferase ribozyme that is capable of transferring a biotinylated methionyl group from the 3\xe2\x80\x98 end of a hexanucleotide substrate to its own 5\xe2\x80\x98-hydroxyl. Comparison of the sequences of a family of evolved derivatives of this ribozyme allowed us to generate a model of the secondary structure of the ribozyme. The predicted secondary structure was extensively tested and confirmed by single-mutant and compensatory double-mutant analyses. The role of the template domain in aligning the acyl-donor oligonucleotide and acyl-acceptor region of the ribozyme was confirmed in a similar manner. The significance of different domains of the ribozyme structure and the importance of two tandem G:U wobble base pairs in the template domain were studied by kinetic characterization of mutant ribozymes. The wobble base pairs contribute to the catalytic rate enhancement, but only in the context of the complete ribozyme; the ribozyme in turn alters the metal binding properties of this site. Competitive inhibition experiments with unacylated substrate oligonucleotide are consistent with the ribozyme acting to stabilize substrate binding to the template, while negative interactions with the aminoacyl portion of the substrate destabilize binding. \t\t\t\t\t"
"PNA dimers 1\xe2\x88\x925, containing either 4-thiothymine or N3-methyl-4-thiothymine, were prepared, and the crystal structure of compound 3 was established. With regard to their photochemistry, none of these PNA analogues were able to fully mimic the photochemical behavior observed in the dinucleotide series. Whereas 1 and 2 displayed a sequence dependent photochemistry to give mainly 4-(\xce\xb1-thyminyl) adducts, their rearranged isomers 3 and 4 yielded mostly (5\xe2\x88\x924) photoadducts. Photoproducts originating from 3 and 4 were shown to undergo spontaneous reversal to their dithyminyl parent derivatives under acid conditions. Moreover, as a result of this photochemical study, it can be suggested that in solution, even at the dimer stage, PNAs adopt a conformation reminiscent of A-type DNA. "
"The addition of o-carborane (1) to aldehydes 2 proceeded very smoothly in the presence of aqueous tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF; 3 equiv) at room temperature, giving the corresponding carbinols 3 in high yields. The TBAF-mediated reaction was applied to the intramolecular cycloaddition of o-carboranyl aldehydes and ketones 4, and the corresponding five-, six-, and seven-membered carboracycles were obtained in good-to-high yields. Further, [3 + 2] annulation between o-carborane (dianionic C2 synthons) and \xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones (dicationic C3 synthons) proceeded very smoothly in the presence of TBAF to give the corresponding five-membered carbocycles in good-to-high yields. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that the [3 + 2] annulation proceeded through kinetically controlled 1,2-addition and thermodynamically controlled 1,4-addition. "
"Direct irradiation of 1,1-diphenylgermetane in hexane solution affords 1,1,3,3-tetraphenyl-1,3-digermetane in high chemical yield. Photolysis in the presence of aliphatic alcohols leads instead to the formation of the corresponding alkoxymethyldiphenylgermane. These results are consistent with the formation of 1,1-diphenylgermene as a primary photochemical product from photolysis of the germetane. Nanosecond laser flash photolysis of the compound in hexane, acetonitrile, or tetrahydrofuran gives rise to the formation of a transient, assignable to the germene on the basis of its second-order decay kinetics, UV spectrum (\xce\xbbmax = 325 nm), and the fact that it is quenched by addition of alcohols and acetic acid. Absolute rate constants for reaction of 1,1-diphenylgermene with methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, tert-butyl alcohol, acetic acid, the O-deuterated isotopomers, and acetone were determined in the three solvents, using the germetane as the precursor. The kinetics and mechanisms of these germene trapping reactions are discussed and compared to those of silenes. "
"Unilamellar vesicles of anionic, phosphate-functionalized lipid 1 (DPGPNP, 1,2-di-O-hexadecanoyl-rac-glyceryl p-nitrophenyl phosphate, sodium salt) have been prepared both by sonication and by extrusion. The phosphate head groups are hydrolytically stable at pH 7 but can be specifically cleaved, at 25 \xc2\xb0C, on the exo surface by adding, to preformed aggregates, lanthanide(III) cations which are unable to permeate across the bilayer. The exovesicular specificity disappears when the cleavage is performed above the phase transition temperature of the vesicles not because of facilitated permeation of the cations but because of the increased rate of flip-flop of the lipid. Addition of lipophilic amines (N-hexadecyl-N,N\xe2\x80\x98,N\xe2\x80\x98-trimethylethylenediamine, TMED C16; N-hexadecylhistamine, C16-His, hexadecylamine, C16NH2) and, to a lesser extent, the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTABr, induces the cleavage of the remaining fraction of lipid in exo-cleaved vesicles. The additives affect the permeability of the bilayer, likely creating \xe2\x80\x9cleaky patches\xe2\x80\x9d in the vesicular membrane and, in the case of the amines, also transporting the cations across the bilayer by forming lipophilic complexes.

"1,4,6,7-Tetrahydro-1,6,11-trimethyl-5-oxo-5H-benzo[c]pyrido[2,3-e]azepin (11Me-MMPAH) and its 4-mono- and 4,4-dideuterated analogues have been oxidized with a series of p-benzoquinones. The compounds have axial chirality with respect to the orientation of the carbonyl dipole. The hydrogen (deuterium) at the 4-position has different reactivity toward oxidation:\xe2\x80\x89 the anti (with respect to the carbonyl dipole) hydrogen is from 3 to 32 times more reactive than the corresponding syn hydrogen (deuterium). The syn/anti reactivity ratio depends on the reactivity of the quinone (stereoselection without steric effect). The initial electron-transfer process, which is associated with the weakening of the C4\xe2\x88\x92H(D) bond, results in the formation of an electron-transfer complex prior to the chemical reaction. The isotope effect affecting this equilibrium constant is the origin of the \xe2\x80\x9cproduct isotope effect\xe2\x80\x9d, which has long been a subject of controversy. Kinetic primary and secondary isotope effects in the oxidation are also calculated. "
"The zirconocene-coupling of diynes with internal silicon substituents, MeC\xe2\x8b\xaeCMe2SiArSiMe2C\xe2\x8b\xaeCMe (1:\xe2\x80\x89 Ar = 1,4-C6H4; 2:\xe2\x80\x89 Ar = 1,3-C6H4; 3:\xe2\x80\x89 Ar = 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-C6H4C6H4), generates regiospecific polymers containing zirconacyclopentadiene in the main chain (5\xe2\x88\x927). These organometallic polymers hydrolyze cleanly to butadienediyl polymers of the type [Me2SiArSiMe2CHCMeCMeCH]n (11\xe2\x88\x9213), and polymer 5 reacts with iodine to give the iodine-containing polymer [1,4-Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C(I)CMeCMeC(I)]n (14). The organometallic polymers undergo facile and high-yield degradations to macrocycles under mild conditions (refluxing tetrahydrofuran solution). The size and shape of the resulting macrocycles depend upon the nature of the diyne spacer group. Thus, polymers 5 and 7 containing parallel diyne units convert to the trimeric macrocycles [Me2SiArSiMe2C4Me2ZrCp2]3 (15:\xe2\x80\x89 Ar = 1,4-C6H4; 24:\xe2\x80\x89 Ar = 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-C6H4C6H4), while polymer 6 gives the dimeric macrocycle [1,3-Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C4Me2ZrCp2]2 (18). The dimeric macrocycle [Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C6H4SiMe2C4Me2ZrCp2]2 (20) was obtained directly from the zirconocene coupling of Me2Si[(1,4-C6H4)SiMe2(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCMe)]2 (4) by heating the reaction mixture to reflux. In a similar manner, the diyne Me2Si(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCMe)2 was converted in high yield to the hexameric macrocycle [Me2SiC4Me2ZrCp2]6 (22). The macrocycles 15, [1,4-Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C4Me2H2]3 (16), and 18 were characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Molecules of 15 adopt a nearly planar C3 macrocyclic structure with a cavity described by an average transannular Si\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7Si distance of 13.2 \xc3\x85, while the hydrolyzed macrocycle 16 has a chair conformation. This conformation change results from conversion of cis diene groups in the zirconacyclopendiene fragments to trans diene groups in 16. The high-yield formation of macrocycles apparently results from the reversible nature of the alkyne-coupling reaction, which allows for a low-energy pathway to the smallest macrocycle possessing minimal ring strain.

"The structure of orthorhombic Ca6.24(6)Mg3.76(6)Sn7 contains two types of chains built from edge- or face-sharing trigonal prisms of Ca and Mg atoms that are centered by Sn atoms. In one type, bonded zigzag [Sn512-] chains are built of interconnected square-planar (D2h) Sn5 units. Alternating chains of condensed trigonal prismatic cations centered by isolated Sn atoms are interbonded to the first type through Sn\xe2\x88\x92Ca,Mg interactions. The chain unit is two electrons richer than that for a simple Zintl\xe2\x88\x92Klemm formalism for 1-, 2-, and 4-bonded Sn (4b-Sn0) because of the square-planar tin bonding. Band structure calculations within the extended H\xc3\xbcckel formalism indicate the infinite tin chain alone is closed shell, but a metallic behavior (via open \xcf\x80-bonding) is produced by cation mixing in the full structure. Local bonding within square-planar Sn5 consists of normal s, px, py (\xcf\x83) bonding, a single 4c-2e nonbonding MO on the outer tins, and a pz2 lone (\xcf\x80) pair. This new intermediate degree of hypervalency makes the unit isoelectronic with XeF42+. Property studies on powdered samples reveal a good metallic conduction but a small diamagnetism that is not uncharacteristic of heavy p-elements and their compounds. "
"The reactions of 2,6-bis[(phenylthio- or phenylseleno)methyl]phenyl phenyl telluride or the corresponding Te-oxide, with NOBF4 or trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride afforded the new telluranes, [10\xe2\x88\x92Te\xe2\x88\x924(C2X2)]2+\xc2\xb72Y- (\xce\xbb4-tellane) (X = S or Se, Y = BF4 or CF3SO3). These compounds were characterized by elemental and spectroscopic (FABMS, 1H, 13C, and 125Te NMR) analyses. X-ray structure determinations revealed that the hypervalent tellurium atoms are at the center of a distorted trigonal bipyramid, with two apical sulfonio or selenonio ligands connected via transannular bonds. The Te\xe2\x88\x92S distances are in the range 2.652\xe2\x88\x922.706 \xc3\x85, the Te\xe2\x88\x92Se distances in the range 2.759\xe2\x88\x922.807 \xc3\x85, and the X\xe2\x88\x92Te\xe2\x88\x92X bond angles in the range 160.41\xe2\x88\x92163.92 \xc2\xb0. Ab initio calculations indicate that the positive charges in the dications are exclusively on the three chalcogen atoms that form three-center, four-electron bonds. "
"Carbonylmetalate dianions react in thf with the group 13 chlorides XmECl3-m (E = Al, Ga; X = Cl, Me, Et, iBu; m = 0, 1) to yield the monoanionic species [(CO)nM\xe2\x88\x92EXmCl2-m]- (M = Fe, Cr, Mo, W; n = 4, 5) as the primary products which could be isolated as solvent free salts after exchange with a non coordinating cation. After addition of a chelating Lewis base, e.g., tmeda, dme, and solvent exchange with dichloromethane the primary products undergo a second salt elimination reaction, yielding the neutral intermetallic systems (CO)nM\xe2\x88\x92Ga[X(L)2] (M = Cr, Mo, W, Fe; n = 4, 5; X = Cl, Me, Et; L2 = tmeda, dme, bipy, tBu-dab, thf2) (1\xe2\x88\x9214) and (CO)5M-Al[X(L)2] (M = Cr, Mo, W; X = Cl, Et, iBu; L2 = tmeda, tmpda) (15\xe2\x88\x9220, 23, 24). The chloro derivatives can be converted to the corresponding hydrido or tetrahydridoboranato species which is exemplarily shown by compounds 21 and 22. In the case of R2GaCl (R = Me, Et; 2 equiv) as starting compounds a ligand exchange reaction, generating GaR3, occurs, before the second salt elimination takes place. The new intermetallic systems were characterized by means of elemental analysis and IR, Raman, NMR, and mass spectroscopy. The complexes (CO)5Cr\xe2\x88\x92Ga[Cl(tmeda)] (2), (CO)5W\xe2\x88\x92Al[Et(tmeda)] (20), and (CO)5W\xe2\x88\x92Al[Cl(tmpda)] (23) are also characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

"The geometric and electronic structures of high-spin ferrous complexes of bleomycin (FeIIBLM) and a series of systematically perturbed BLM derivatives have been investigated by optical absorption, circular dichroism (CD), and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopies. The active site of the unmodified drug complex is six-coordinate with the coordination sphere completed by at least five endogenous ligands including the pyrimidine, imidazole, deprotonated amide, and secondary and primary amine functionalities with either the 3-O-carbamoyl substituent of the mannose sugar or solvent bound at the sixth site. This weak sixth ligand is the exchangeable site of exogenous small molecule binding. Perturbing the carbamoyl substituent alters the coordination environment of the metal and decreases the azide binding affinities of the perturbed complexes. This is correlated with altered DNA cleaving capabilities. Additionally, altering the binding of the axial primary amine significantly affects the iron coordination sphere as evidenced by reduced \xcf\x80-back-bonding interactions specifically with the pyrimidine ligand. This pyrimidine \xcf\x80-back-bonding appears to play a key role in mediating the electron density localized on the ferrous center, which contributes to the unique oxygen chemistry and reactivity exhibited by FeIIBLM relative to other non-heme iron sites. Oxygen binding to derivatives in which the \xce\xb2-aminoalanine fragment has been removed leads to a high-spin ferric complex and no observed DNA strand scission, in contrast to the long-lived low-spin activated BLM intermediate that precedes DNA degradation.

"A new cadmium thiolate with overall composition [ClCd8{SCH(CH2CH2)2N(H)Me}16](ClO4)15\xc2\xb716[SCH(CH2CH2)2N(H)Me]\xc2\xb732H2O has been obtained in a high ionic strength aqueous medium. The solid is a polycrystal consisting of equally oriented microcrystals of formula [ClCd8{SCH(CH2CH2)2N(H)Me}16](ClO4)15\xc2\xb716H2O held together by uncoordinated aminothiolate ligands and water molecules occupying the intercrystal spaces. The composition and structure of the microcrystals is shown by X-ray, XPS, and 113Cd NMR data. The uncoordinated aminothiolate ligands in zwitterionic form and water molecules are essential for the initial formation but not for the continued stability of the microcrystals as their chemical extraction leads to a new microcrystalline powder with essentially the same powder X-ray diffraction pattern. The existence of intercrystal spaces is confirmed by electron and atomic force microscopy techniques, SEM and AFM. The [ClCd8{SCH(CH2CH2)2N(H)Me}16]15+ cage can be described in terms of metal and ligand concentric polyhedra of increasing size as centro-Cl-tetrahedro-Cd4-cuboctahedro-(\xce\xbc-SRH)12-tetrahedro-(CdSRH)4, where SRH denotes -SCH(CH2CH2)2N+(H)Me, and thus it constitutes the first example of a metal thiolate cluster where the topology of the bridging ligands is that of a cuboctahedron. Comparison with dimensions predicted by Dance for an idealized topology is made. The structural correspondences between a [ClCd4(\xce\xbc-SRH)4(SRH)6] fragment in [ClCd8{SCH(CH2CH2)2N(H)Me}16]15+ and the Cd4(S-Cys)11 cluster in the \xce\xb1 domain of metallothioneins, both formed by two fused six-membered cycles, are also discussed.

"X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the molybdenum and selenium K-edges has been used to probe the active site structure of Escherichia coli formate dehydrogenase H. The active sites of both oxidized and reduced wild-type protein, and of a variant containing cysteine instead of selenocysteine, were studied. The oxidized and reduced enzymes were found to be very similar, both containing a novel des-oxo molybdenum site, with four Mo\xe2\x88\x92S ligands at 2.35 \xc3\x85, (probably) one Mo\xe2\x88\x92O at 2.1 \xc3\x85, and one Mo\xe2\x88\x92Se ligand at 2.62 \xc3\x85 being indicated from the Mo K-edge data. The selenium K-edge EXAFS not only is in good agreement with the Mo K-edge data but also indicates the unexpected presence of Se\xe2\x88\x92S ligation, with a bond length of 2.19 \xc3\x85. We suggest that the active site of Escherichia coli formate dehydrogenase H contains a novel seleno-sulfide ligand to molybdenum, where the selenium and sulfur originate from selenocysteine and one of the pterin-cofactor dithiolenes, respectively.

"Formylbiliverdin and related chlorophyll-derived molecules are possible products of heme catabolism and other biologically important oxidative processes and are likely to be initially formed as metal complexes. To explore the properties of the formylbiliverdin moiety bound to transition metal ions, complexes of octaethylformylbiliverdin (H2OEFB) with Cu(II), Ni(II), and Co(II) have been prepared, since attempts to prepare an iron complex have produced only an unstable material. Transmetalation of MgII(OEFB), made by photooxidation of MgII(octaethyl-porphyrin), with a metal(II) acetate yields the low-spin complexes:\xe2\x80\x89 CuII(OEFB), NiII(OEFB), and CoII(OEFB). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction of CuII(OEFB) reveals that it consists of a four-coordinate copper(II) center which is bound to the four nitrogen atoms in distorted planar coordination. The tetrapyrrole ligand has a helical geometry. The structure of the solid is complicated by the existence of three molecules in the asymmetric unit and C\xe2\x88\x92H\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7O hydrogen bonding between pairs of these in the tab/slot arrangement seen in complexes of octaethylbiliverdin. Both CuII(OEFB) and CoII(OEFB) can be converted to the verdoheme analogues, [CuII(OEOP)]+ and [CoII(OEOP)]+, where OEOP is the anion of octaethyl-5-oxaporphyrin, by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, [CuII(OEOP)]+ can be produced by heating a toluene solution CuII(OEFB) in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid under dioxygen. Carbon monoxide is produced when CuII(OEFB) is converted to [CuII(OEOP)]+ by either method. [CuII(OEOP)](PF6) has been characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction which shows that the cation has a planar, porphyrin-like structure. The room-temperature EPR spectrum of this complex shows that the copper is four-coordinate with four nitrogen based ligands, but frozen solutions of [CuII(OEOP)]+ show a triplet EPR spectrum indicative of a dimeric species much like that in the X-ray crystal structure. The 1H NMR spectrum of diamagnetic NiII(OEFB) has been shown to be consistent with the helical structure through the use of lanthanide and chiral lanthanide shift reagents. The EPR spectra of CoII(OEFB) show that it forms a low-spin adduct with pyridine and that this adduct acts as a reversible dioxygen carrier. The geometric and electronic structural properties of these complexes of formylbiliverdin are compared to those of analogous compounds of biliverdin and of porphyrins. "
"In this paper, ab initio CASSCF computations are used to investigate the photoisomerization path of the protonated Schiff base (PSB) 4-cis-\xce\xb3-methylnona-2,4,6,8-tetraeniminium cation:\xe2\x80\x89 a five conjugated double bond model of the retinal chromophore of rhodopsin (the human retina visual pigment).We show that, after initial skeletal relaxation from the Franck\xe2\x88\x92Condon region (which involves a large increase in the central CC bond length), the system is \xe2\x80\x9ctrapped\xe2\x80\x9d in an energy plateau on the S1 energy surface which may be the origin of the \xe2\x80\x9cslow\xe2\x80\x9d cis \xe2\x86\x92 trans isomerization dynamics observed in retinal PSBs in solution. The energy plateau is absent in shorter retinal chromophore models which have a steeper S1 isomerization path. The rhodopsin cavity (where the native chromophore is embedded) may have the effect of removing the energy plateau from the S1 potential thus dramatically increasing the photoisomerization rate from picoseconds to femtoseconds.

"Correlated quantum-chemical calculations are used to investigate the influence of interchain interactions on the absorption and emission of \xcf\x80-conjugated chains. The results are discussed in relation to the utilization of conjugated materials as active elements in electro-optic devices; they provide guidelines on how to prevent a substantial decrease in luminescence yield in solid films. In high-symmetry cofacial configurations, interchain interactions lead to a blue shift of the lowest optical transition compared to that calculated for an isolated chain; the appearance of an additional red-shifted component is expected when positional disorder is considered. The absence of any significant oscillator strength in the transition between the ground state and the lowest excited state in highly symmetric complexes implies that the luminescence emission will be strongly quenched. This picture is, however, modified when one takes account of the relaxation processes which occur in the lowest excited state. The nature of the most stable photogenerated species and the role played by chemical impurities are also addressed. "
"Isotopic labeling of Bombyx mori silk fibroin was achieved biosynthetically using two approaches. First, labeled fibroin was achieved by feeding silk worms [13C1]Gly and [13C1]Ala along with an artificial diet. Second, in vitro production of [15N]Gly and [15N]Ala labeled B. mori silk fibroin was accomplished by culturing the posterior silk glands isolated from five-day-old silkworm larvae in the fifth instar stage. Orientation-dependent 15N and 13C solid-state NMR spectra of these isotope-labeled silk fibroin fibers were observed when the fiber axis was arranged at various angles between 0\xc2\xb0 and 90\xc2\xb0 to the magnetic field direction. Such data from the silk II structure was simulated on the basis of the chemical shift anisotropy to determine the Euler angles that relate the principal axis system (PAS) to the fiber axis coordinate system. The dipolar modulated 15N and 13C chemical shift powder pattern spectra of 13C\xe2\x88\x9215N double-labeled silk fibroin model peptides were observed and simulated to determine the Euler angles for transforming the PAS to molecular symmetry axis (MSA) system. The specific orientations of NH, NC1, C1O, and C1N bonds for Ala and Gly residues in the oriented silk fibroin fiber were determined with a combination of these Euler angles. The conformational space for the Ala and Gly residues of the silk fibroin fibers was substantially reduced with these bond orientations and the known C\xce\xb1(i-1)\xe2\x88\x92C\xce\xb1(i+1) vector orientation from fiber diffraction studies. The best fit torsion angles (\xcf\x86,\xcf\x88) within the reduced conformational space were determined as (\xe2\x88\x92140\xc2\xb0, 142\xc2\xb0) and (\xe2\x88\x92139\xc2\xb0, 135\xc2\xb0), respectively within experimental error (\xc2\xb15\xc2\xb0). The distance of the unit cell length determined here results in excellent agreement with the fiber diffraction data. "
"The enzyme-bound conformation of C-lactose, an Escherichia coli \xce\xb2-galactosidase inhibitor has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that the enzyme selects a high-energy conformation of this closely related structural analogue of the natural substrate, lactose. In addition, a molecular modeling protocol has been performed in order to obtain a detailed three-dimensional structure of the complex that can explain, in structural terms, the role that the key amino acid residues play in the catalytic mechanism. The implications of the recognition of a high-energy conformation of the analogue are also outlined. "
"The site-to-site intramolecular excitation transfer and excitation trapping on one site in amino-substituted triphenylbenzene derivatives, which are characterized by a 3-fold symmetry, have been studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC). The importance of dipole relaxation due to intramolecular energy transfer has been demonstrated in the interpretation of the limiting anisotropy on one hand and the change of the dipole moment and polarizability upon excitation on the other hand. The interpretation of the experimental results is based on the comparison of the molecules with C3-symmetry with biphenyl model compounds. "
"We have obtained the solid-state 15N nuclear magnetic resonance isotropic chemical shifts and/or shielding tensor elements for a range of nitrosoarene complexes:\xe2\x80\x89 p-[15N]nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline, p-[15N]nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline hydrochloride monohydrate, PdCl2(p-[15N]nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline)2, ZnCl2(p-[15N]nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline)2, SnCl2(CH3)2(p-[15N]nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline)2, PdCl2([15N]nitrosobenzene)2, [Fe(CO)3([15N]nitrosobenzene)]2, and the [15N]nitrosobenzene adducts of horse heart myoglobin and adult human hemoglobin. The isotropic chemical shifts range from 171 to 802 ppm downfield from NH3(ext,l). Using a density functional method, we have computed the isotropic shifts, the shielding tensor elements, and the absolute shieldings, for each of these compounds. There is excellent accord between theory and experiment. In addition, the orientations of the tensors have been calculated, and for the dimer of PhNO, cis-dioxyazodibenzene, there is good accord with an experimental determination of the shielding tensor. Our results indicate that the shielding patterns observed from compound to compound are overwhelmingly dominated by the behavior of \xcf\x8311, the least shielded element of the shielding tensor, which is oriented close to the N\xe2\x88\x92O bond vector (perpendicular to the PhNO \xcf\x80 orbital). We also find an excellent correlation between \xcf\x8311 and the N\xe2\x88\x92O Mayer bond order, with hemoglobin, myoglobin and all model compounds fitting the correlation well (R2 = 0.963). The nitrosoarenes have among the largest known 15N shielding tensor widths, but by using density functional methods, it is possible to accurately compute them, even when they are bonded to transition metals. Overall, these results thus represent the first comprehensive NMR and quantum chemical study of RNO bonding to heme proteins and model systems, and should form the basis for future comparative studies of the biologically important isoelectronic species, dioxygen.

"Solvolysis of CMP N-acetyl neuraminate (CMP-NeuAc) in 1.8 M acetate buffer at pH 5 containing 0.9 M azide results in the formation of both anomers of 2-deoxy-2-azido N-acetyl neuraminic acid in addition to N-acetyl neuraminic acid as determined by 1H-NMR product analysis. A rate dependence on [azide] was observed with an apparent bimolecular rate constant of (2.1 \xc2\xb1 0.3) \xc3\x97 10-3 M-l min-l which could only account for half of the azido-NeuAc formed. Comparison of rate, product ratio, and stereochemical data indicate that concurrent pathways for formation of N3-NeuAc are operative, with 17% of product forming from reaction of azide and the tight ion pair, 12% via the solvent separated ion pair, and 6% from the free NeuAc oxocarbenium ion. From the corrected product ratio data, the lifetime of the oxocarbenium ion was estimated to be \xe2\x89\xa53 \xc3\x97 10-11 s. Solvolysis of CMP-NeuAc at pL = 5.0 afforded an observed solvent deuterium isotope effect (SDIE) kH2O/kD2O = 0.45, consistent with specific acid catalysis of glycosidic bond cleavage. A SDIE of 0.66 for the apparent bimolecular azide trapping pathway was also observed. An apparent isotope effect of \xe2\x88\xbc1.1 for trapping of the N-acetyl neuraminyl oxocarbenium ion by water was determined by product analysis of azide trapping in H2O and D2O. An ab initio transition state for attack of water on an N-acetyl neuraminyl oxocarbenium ion model was located which featured a hydrogen bond between the oxocarbenium ion carboxylate and water; proton transfer was not part of the reaction coordinate. It is proposed that the N-acetyl neuraminate carboxylate group stabilizes an intermediate oxocarbenium ion, but the barrier for capture by water is lowered by a transition state hydrogen bond. "
"The one-pot biocatalytic synthesis of novel amphiphilic products consisting of an ethyl glucopyranoside (EGP) headgroup and a hydrophobic chain is described. The porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL) catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of \xce\xb5-caprolactone (\xce\xb5-CL) by the multifunctional initiator EGP was carried out at 70 \xc2\xb0C in bulk. Products of variable oligo(\xce\xb5-CL) chain length (Mn = 450, 2200) were formed by variation of the \xce\xb5-CL/EGP ratio. Extension of this approach using Candida antarctica lipase (Novozym-435) and EGP as the initiator for trimethylene carbonate (TMC) ring-opening polymerization also resulted in the formation of an EGP\xe2\x88\x92oligo(TMC) conjugate (Mn = 7200). Structural analysis by 1H, 13C, and COSY (13C-13C) NMR experiments showed that the reaction was highly regiospecific; i.e., the oligo(\xce\xb5-CL)/oligo(TMC) chains formed were attached by an ester/carbonate link exclusively to the primary hydroxyl moiety of EGP.

"The discovery of novel non-peptide compounds with a high affinity for the peptide hormone somatostatin (SST) receptor is described. The compounds were tested for affinity at five human SST receptor subtypes individually expressed in mammalian cells. The compound NNC 26-9100 showed a Ki of 6 nM at SST4 and more than 100 fold selectivity for SST4 over SST1, SST2, SST3, or SST5. Competition binding studies and Scatchard analysis of the interaction by NNC 26-9100 with SST showed specificity at SST4. Furthermore, NNC 26-9100 was highly selective for SST4 over a variety of other G protein-coupled receptors, having affinities for M1 muscarinic acetylcholin and D3 dopamine receptors of around 500 and 1000 nM, respectively. Finally, NNC 26-9100 was found to fully inhibit forskolin-induced accumulation of adenosine 3\xe2\x80\x98,5\xe2\x80\x98-cyclic monophosphate in baby hamster kidney cells, expressing the human SST4 receptor with an EC50 of 2 nM.

"To understand the mechanism of polymer epitaxy during solution polymerization (polymerization-induced epitaxy, PIE), the kinetics of the epitaxial film growth was compared with that of polymerization in solution. The surface coverage and the domain size of epitaxial films as well as the molecular weight of the polymer formed in solution were examined as functions of the reaction time, the monomer concentration, and the initiator concentration. Atomic force microscopy was used to evaluate the coverage and the apparent island size distribution. Cationic ring-opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran (THF) in dichloromethane at 0 \xc2\xb0C on a graphite substrate in the reaction mixture induces an epitaxial film of poly(THF), consisting of 0.5 nm thick, flat, rectangular islands. The reaction time dependence indicates that the film has developed much faster than the polymer growth in solution. When the monomer concentration was varied, no polymer was formed in solution below 3 mol/L, corresponding to the equilibrium monomer concentration. The well-developed PIE film was formed even below this concentration. This result proves that PIE is not an adsorption of the polymers that have first formed in solution. At low initiator concentrations, the polymerization in solution was significantly disturbed due to side reactions, while the PIE film developed well at all concentrations without noticeable dependence on the initiator concentration. This shows that the polymerization reaction responsible for PIE is minimally affected by termination or chain transfer reactions. The kinetics suggests a possibility of the monomer concentration enhancement near the surface. On the basis of these results, a positive feedback model of polymerization with epitaxial adsorption through conformational constraint is proposed as a PIE mechanism. "
"Three-ring polyamides containing pyrrole (Py) and imidazole (Im) amino acids covalently coupled by \xce\xb3-aminobutyric acid (\xce\xb3) form six-ring hairpins that recognize five-base-pair sequences in the minor groove of DNA. Selective chiral substitution of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xce\xb3-turn\xe2\x80\x9d enhances the properties of polyamide hairpins with regard to DNA affinity and sequence specificity. Polyamides of core sequence composition ImPyPy-\xce\xb3-PyPyPy which differ by selective stereochemical substitution of the prochiral \xce\xb1-position in the \xce\xb3-turn were prepared. The DNA binding properties of two enantiomeric polyamides were analyzed by footprinting and affinity cleavage on a DNA fragment containing two match sites (5\xe2\x80\x98-TGTTA-3\xe2\x80\x98 and 5\xe2\x80\x98-ACATT-3\xe2\x80\x98) and one 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGTCA-3\xe2\x80\x98 mismatch site. Quantitative footprint titrations demonstrate that replacement of \xce\xb3-aminobutyric acid by (R)-2,4-diaminobutyric acid enhances DNA binding affinity for the 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGTTA-3\xe2\x80\x98 match site 13-fold (Ka = 3.8 \xc3\x97 109 M-1). The enhanced affinity is achieved without a compromise in sequence selectivity, which in fact increases and is found to be 100-fold higher relative to binding at a single base pair mismatch sequence, 5\xe2\x80\x98-TGTCA-3\xe2\x80\x98. An (S)-2,4-diaminobutyric acid linked hairpin binds with 170-fold reduced affinity relative to the R-enantiomer and only 5-fold sequence specificity versus a 5\xe2\x80\x98-ACATT-3\xe2\x80\x98 reversed orientation site. These effects are modulated by acetylation of the chiral amine substituents. This study identifies structural elements which should facilitate the design of new hairpin polyamides with improved DNA binding affinity, sequence specificity, and orientational selectivity. "
"The synthesis of the hexasaccharide fragment of the antitumor antibiotic landomycin A (1) (aka. NSC 639187) is described. The stereocontrolled introduction of key glycoside linkages relies on the combined application of glycosyl tetrazoles and phosphites to establish \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 glycosidic linkages, respectively. Spectral comparison of landomycin A octaacetate (2) and hexasaccharide pentaacetate (3) serves to corroborate the assigned structure of 1 within the oligosaccharide domain. "
"Upon heating of the highly sterically congested 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)dispiro[3,3\xe2\x80\x98,4,4\xe2\x80\x98-biadamantane-1,2-disilacyclobutane] (2) in solution in the presence of trapping reagents, such as 1,3-butadienes, styrene, phenylacetylene, and methanol, the trapping products of the silene bis(trimethylsilyl)adamantylidenesilene (1) are formed with high regioselectivity and good yields. Photolysis of 2 at \xe2\x88\x92196 \xc2\xb0C in methylcyclohexane in the absence of trapping agents produces tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)disilene (3). Photolysis of 2 in solution in the presence of 1,3-butadiene leads to a 2:1 mixture of 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)-1,2-disilacyclohex-4-ene (10)the trapping product of the disilene 3and of 1,1-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1-silacyclopent-3-ene (11)the trapping product of bis(trimethylsilyl)silylene (4)together with 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-biadamantylidene. The results of laser flash photolysis and of additional trapping experiments suggest that the sole primary product in the photolysis of 2 is the disilene 3, which dissociates under further irradiation to produce the silylene 4. Heating of 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)dispiro[3,3\xe2\x80\x98,4,4\xe2\x80\x98-biadamantane-1,2-digermacyclobutane] (14) in solution results in the quantitative formation of 2,2\xe2\x80\x98-biadamantylidene and of germanium-containing oligomers, while neither bis(trimethylsilyl)adamantylidenegermene (15) nor tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)digermene (16) or bis(trimethylsilyl)germylene (17) could be trapped. Upon photolysis 14 behaves similarly to 2, leading to 16 and 17, which could be trapped by 1,3-butadiene. "
"The aqueous ethanolysis reactions of the adamantylideneadamantyl halides (2-Cl, 2-Br, and 2-I) exhibit Grunwald\xe2\x88\x92Winstein sensitivity parameters (m) of 0.74 \xc2\xb1 0.06, 0.90 \xc2\xb1 0.01, and 0.88 \xc2\xb1 0.03 for the chloride, bromide, and iodide compounds, respectively. All reaction products are formed with retention of both the ring structure and the stereochemistry of the reaction center. Common-ion rate depressions are observed during the solvolyses of all three of the homoallylic halides, a result that is consistent with these reactions proceeding via a free-solvated homoallylic carbenium ion. The rate of nucleophilic capture of the homoallylic carbenium ion exhibits a Swain\xe2\x88\x92Scott parameter (s) of 0.20 \xc2\xb1 0.01, indicating that these reactions show a low sensitivity to the nature of the nucleophile. From the data it is estimated that the lifetime of the homoallylic carbenium ion (1) in 60:40 v/v EtOH\xe2\x88\x92H2O at 25 \xc2\xb0C is at least 6.4 \xc3\x97 10-9 s. "
"In this work we have defined the nature of the p-cresol and p-thiocresol adducts generated from acylium ions during HF cleavage, following contemporary Boc/benzyl solid-phase peptide synthesis. Contrary to the results in previous reports, we found that both p-cresol and p-thiocresol predominantly form aryl esters under typical cleavage conditions. Initially we investigated a number of small peptides containing either a single glutamate residue or a C-terminal long-chain amino acid which allowed us to unambiguously characterize the \xe2\x80\x9cscavenged\xe2\x80\x9d side products. Whereas, the p-cresol esters are stable at 0 \xc2\xb0C they rearrange irreversibly at higher temperatures (5\xe2\x88\x9220 \xc2\xb0C) to form aryl ketones. By contrast, p-thiocresol esters do not undergo a Fries rearrangement but readily undergo further additions of p-thiocresol to form ketenebisthioacetals and trithio ortho esters, even at low temperatures. Importantly, we found by LC/MS and FT-ICR MS analysis that peptides containing p-cresol esters at glutamyl side chains are susceptible to amidation and fragmentation reactions at these sites during standard mild base workup procedures. The significance of these side reactions was further demonstrated in the synthesis of neutrophil immobilization factor, a 26-residue peptide, containing four glutamic acid residues. The side reactions were largely avoided by mild hydrogen peroxide-catalyzed hydrolysis which converted the p-cresol adducts to the free carboxylic acids in near quantitative yield. The choice of p-cresol as a reversible acylium ion scavenger when coupled with the simple workup conditions described is broadly applicable to Boc/benzyl peptide synthesis and will significantly enhance the quality of peptides produced.

"Catalytic hydrosilation of 1-(trimethylsilyl)-1-buten-3-yne (1) with three kinds of hydrosilanes (HSiMePh2, HSiMe2Ph, and HSiEt3) in CDCl3 at 30 \xc2\xb0C in the presence of a catalytic amount of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 (2) gave five types of reaction products:\xe2\x80\x89 (1E,3E)-CH(SiR3)CHCHCHSiMe3 (3), R3SiCH2CHCHCH2SiMe3 (4), R3SiCHCCHCH2SiMe3 (5), (1Z,3E)-CH(SiR3)CHCHCHSiMe3 (6), and R3SiC\xe2\x8b\xaeCCHCHSiMe3 (7). Detailed investigations on the stoichiometric reactions of intermediate ruthenium species provided definitive evidence for the catalytic mechanism comprised of two catalytic cycles, the Chalk\xe2\x88\x92Harrod cycle A and the modified Chalk\xe2\x88\x92Harrod cycle C, and their interconnecting processes B and D. Product 3 is formed by the insertion of 1 into the Ru\xe2\x88\x92H bond of 2 followed by the reaction of the resulting terminal dienyl complex Ru(CHCHCHCHSiMe3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (8) with hydrosilane. The latter process regenerates 2 and the sequence of reactions proceeds catalytically (cycle A). The reaction of 8 with hydrosilane is accompanied by a side reaction giving Ru(SiR3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (9) and CH2CHCHCHSiMe3 (10), and the latter is further converted to 4 by hydrosilation (process B). Silyl complex 9 thus generated in the system is the key intermediate for catalytic cycle C. Thus the insertion of 1 into the Ru\xe2\x88\x92SiR3 bond of 9 via a formal trans-addition process forms an internal dienylruthenium complex Ru[C(CHSiR3)CHCHSiMe3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (11), which reacts with hydrosilane to give 5 and 6 and to regenerate 9. A part of 11 also undergoes \xce\xb2-hydrogen elimination to give a dehydrogenative silation product 8 and hydride complex 2. Complex 2 thus formed resumes catalytic cycle A (process D). The catalytic intermediates 8, 9, and 11 were identified by NMR spectroscopy and/or elemental analysis. Factors controlling the catalytic cycles are discussed on the basis of the experimental observations. "
"The solid-state structure of unsolvated, Lewis base-free phenyllithium (LiC6H5) is reported. Structure determination of the simplest lithium aryl was performed by high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. The structure was solved by ab initio methods in combination with difference Fourier analysis and consecutive Rietveld refinements. Solid phenyllithium consists of dimeric Li2Ph2 molecules, which strongly interact with adjacent Li2Ph2 moieties, forming a polymeric, infinite-ladder structure along the crystallographic b-axis. In the Li2Ph2 units the two lithium atoms and the C(ipso) atoms of the two phenyl rings form an absolutely planar, four-membered ring with the two phenyl rings perpendicular to it. The bonding of the C(ipso) atom to the two Li atoms can be described as a three-center, two-electron bond (Li\xe2\x88\x92C 2.24(1) and 2.32(1) \xc3\x85; Li\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x88\x92Li\xe2\x80\x98 63.2(7)\xc2\xb0). The \xcf\x80-electrons of the phenyl rings interact strongly with the lithium atoms of neighboring Li2Ph2 moieties. "
"The kinetic influence of an alkyne ligand, hexafluorobut-2-yne (HFB), has been investigated by studying the reactions of phosphines (PR3) with the complexes M(CO)4(\xce\xb72-HFB) (M = Fe, Ru, Os). The rate of production of M(CO)3(PR3)(\xce\xb72-HFB) is independent of the nature and concentration of the phosphine in all cases, indicating that the rate-controlling step is CO dissociation. The kinetic parameters, k1 (s-1, 25 \xc2\xb0C), \xce\x94H* (kJ mol-1), and \xce\x94S* (cal mol-1 K-1) are:\xe2\x80\x89 9.5, 88.2 \xc2\xb1 2.3, 70 \xc2\xb1 10 (Fe); 1.25 \xc3\x97 10-2, 103.6 \xc2\xb1 2.4, 66 \xc2\xb1 8.6 (Ru); 3.5 \xc3\x97 10-3, 99.5 \xc2\xb1 0.8, 21 \xc2\xb1 2.7 (Os). When the rate constants at 25 \xc2\xb0C for M(CO)4(\xce\xb72-HFB) are compared to those of the parent M(CO)5, the ratios are \xe2\x88\xbc3 \xc3\x97 1013, 1.8 \xc3\x97 102 and 1 \xc3\x97 107 for M = Fe, Ru, and Os, respectively. Clearly the alkyne increases the substitution lability, and the effect is spectacular with Fe, very large with Os, and substantial but relatively more modest with Ru. The increased lability results mainly from a reduced \xce\x94H* of \xe2\x88\xbc80, 10, and 33 kJ mol-1 for Fe, Ru, and Os, respectively, and this is attributed largely to stabilization of the transition state by 4-electron donation from the alkyne ligand. Also reported are kinetics of formation of some trans M(CO)2(PR3)2(\xce\xb72-HFB) complexes and an extension of earlier work on the Os(CO)5/PPh3 system. "
"The nature of the Rh\xe2\x88\x92diamine precursor in the catalytic cycle of the asymmetric hydride transfer reduction of carbonyl compounds was examined by both theoretical and experimental approaches. On the one hand, calculations based on the DFT theory were performed on various [RhH(NH3)n(C2H4)4-n] complexes, in the trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) and square pyramidal (SP) forms. Their geometry has been fully optimized, and it was found that the only stable complex corresponds to n = 2 in a TBP form, with the ethylenes in the equatorial plane. On the other hand, mass analyses of the synthesized complexes showed that their composition was [Rh(COD)(diamine)]+ X- (X- = Cl- or PF6-). Several experiments were performed to study the influence of the ligand stoichiometry, the nature of the diene (cyclooctadiene (COD) or others). Finally, the two methods converged and proved that the active species contains only one diamine and one diene bound to the metal. "
"The accurate experimental electron density of crystalline bis(5-cyclooctadiene)nickel, Ni(COD)2, has been determined by X-ray diffraction (T = 125 K, 17\xe2\x80\x89051 reflections measured for 2\xce\xb8 \xe2\x89\xa4 96\xc2\xb0) and it has been interpreted in terms of quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAM). The data were measured with a CCD area detector, whose performances were tested. This experimental electron density study of a \xcf\x80-ligand \xce\xb72-coordinated to a metal atom is intended to test the Dewar\xe2\x88\x92Chatt\xe2\x88\x92Duncanson (DCD) bonding formalism providing further information about the \xcf\x80-complex vs metallacycle dichotomy. QTAM analysis, within the NiC2 triangle, shows a ring structure with a bond critical point between the two C(sp2), two bond critical points between Ni and each carbon, and one ring critical point in its center. Topology speaks for a \xcf\x80-complex with a concave ring structure and the overall bonding picture is in agreement with the DCD model:\xe2\x80\x89 \xcf\x83-donation and \xcf\x80-back-bonding are recognized in the Ni\xe2\x88\x92C bond paths, which are inwardly curved (\xcf\x83-donation) but well separated (\xcf\x80-back-donation).

"The rotational barrier for MoW(meso-monotolyl octaethylporphyrin)2 ([(TOEP)MoW(TOEP)]) has been determined (\xce\x94G\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\xa7\xa7rot = 10.6 \xc2\xb1 0.1 kcal/mol) by variable-temperature NMR and complete band shape analysis and is compared with values previously obtained for the analogous homodimers. The overall quadruple bond strengths of these isostructural dimolybdenum, ditungsten, and molybdenum\xe2\x88\x92tungsten porphyrin dimers have also been compared by calculation of the force constants corresponding to each metal\xe2\x88\x92metal bond stretching frequency as observed by resonance Raman spectroscopy. The Raman results are as follows:\xe2\x80\x89 [Mo(OEP)]2, \xce\xbdMoMo = 310 cm-1, k = 2.72 mdyn/\xc3\x85; [(OEP)MoW(OEP)], \xce\xbdMoW = 279 cm-1, k = 2.89 mdyn/\xc3\x85; [Mo(TOEP)]2, \xce\xbdMoMo = 310 cm-1, k = 2.72 \xce\xbdMoMo [W(TOEP)]2, \xce\xbdWW = 275 cm-1, k = 4.08 mdyn/\xc3\x85; and [(TOEP)MoW(TOEP)], \xce\xbdMoW = 278 cm-1, k = 2.87 mdyn/\xc3\x85. Both the 1H NMR and Raman specta are consistent with a [(Por)MoW(Por)] structure wherein the Mo(Por) congener experiences a more drastic \xe2\x80\x9cbending-back\xe2\x80\x9d distortion of the porphyrin macrocycle.

"A water-soluble complex Rh/PPA(Na+)/DPPEA 1 was obtained from poly(4-pentenoic acid) (PPA) and bis[2-(diphenylphosphino)ethyl]amine (DPPEA). Complex 1 is a highly active catalyst for the hydroformylation of olefins. Some selectivity for linear aldehydes was observed in the hydroformylation of aliphatic olefins, while high ratios of branched aldehydes resulted in the case of vinyl ethers. Complex 1 is also the first polymeric water-soluble metal complex which can catalyze the conversion of vinylarenes to 2-arylpropanals in a highly chemoselective and regioselective manner. "
"Using X-ray scattering, the structure of compressed phospholipid monolayers at the air\xe2\x88\x92water interface matrixed with varying amounts of polymer lipid has been determined. The out-of-plane structure of the monolayer was greatly perturbed by the incorporation of the bulky polymer lipid resulting in a systematic roughening of the interface and a decrease in the coherently Bragg-scattering lipid tail region. Our results indicate that the increased lateral packing stresses due to the hydrophilic polymer chains are predominately relaxed through an increase in lipid protrusions rather than an increased area per lipid molecule.

"Triple fluorescence is observed for 4-(N-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecyl)benzonitrile (DMABN-Cyclam) in ethanol, corresponding to a locally excited (LE) singlet state, a twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) state, and an intramolecular exciplex (E). The LE state emission dominates the spectrum in nonpolar solvents such as n-hexane, while polar solvents stabilize the charge-transfer states, TICT and E. Optimal intramolecular exciplex emission, however, was observed in toluene, while the TICT band was maximal in water. The influence of pH on the fluorescent properties of DMABN-Cyclam were studied, indicating that protonation of cyclam strongly influences the equilibria existing between the three excited-state species, as well as the extent of quenching apparent for each excited-state band. DMABN-Cyclam uniquely responded to the addition of micromolar quantities of transition metal cations with varying changes in the triple fluorescence emission. "
"An amphiphilic anionic azobenzene derivative, soluble in water, formed a monolayer on an aqueous subphase containing a water-soluble polycation. The monolayers were transferred onto solid substrate by the Langmuir\xe2\x88\x92Blodgett (LB) technique. XPS measurements showed that ion exchange reaction proceeded almost completely at the air\xe2\x88\x92water interface and that the ratio of the monomer unit of the polycation to the azobenzene was almost unity. UV/vis absorption and IR measurements indicated that the azobenzene photoisomerized reversibly in the LB films on alternate illumination with UV and vis light. Furthermore, a reversible morphological change induced by light was observed in the LB films with AFM. Before illumination, the surface of the single-layer LB film was very smooth with a surface undulation of less than 1 nm. On illumination with UV light, however, a number of hills, with the height of ca. 5 nm and the diameter of the base of ca. 100 nm, appeared on the film surface. These structures almost disappeared on illumination with vis light. This indicates that the widely accepted assumption that photoisomerization should not change the two-dimensional structures significantly does not hold in the present case. "
"The 13C spectra of cyclohexene oxide (1) show decoalescence of the peak at lowest frequency, with slow exchange at \xe2\x88\x92187.7 \xc2\xb0C and a coalescence temperature slightly above \xe2\x88\x92178.2 \xc2\xb0C. The low-temperature NMR results are interpreted in terms of two enantiomeric half-chair conformations, 1a and 1b, which could interconvert by way of either the endo-boat (1c) or exo-boat (1d) conformation. Ab initio calculations indicate that the endo-boat is significantly lower in energy than the exo-boat. Both boat conformations are shallow energy minima, as evidenced by the absence of imaginary frequencies. Relative free energies for the three conformations at \xe2\x88\x92187.7 \xc2\xb0C obtained from Allinger\'s MM3 program are in reasonable agreement with the ab initio results for 25 \xc2\xb0C. A possible explanation for the greater stability of the endo-boat in terms of less eclipsing for the CH hydrogens of the three-membered ring with the CH2 hydrogens on the adjacent carbons is supported by calculated geometries. The experimental rate constant and free-energy barrier for interconversion of 1a and 1b were 227 s-1 and 4.3 \xc2\xb1 0.2 kcal/mol at \xe2\x88\x92178.2 \xc2\xb0C, and the corresponding parameters for the conversion of the half-chair to the endo-boat were 454 s-1 and 4.2 kcal/mol at this temperature. Estimates of the free energy at 25 \xc2\xb0C of the transition state leading to the ring inversion were obtained at the HF/6-311G* and MP2/6-311G* levels by using the STQN method and were found to be 1.09 and 0.88 kcal/mol, respectively, above the local endo-boat minima. The corresponding calculated half-chair to endo-boat free-energy barriers at 25 \xc2\xb0C were 4.87 and 4.96 kcal/mol, in reasonable agreement with the experimental value at \xe2\x88\x92178.2 \xc2\xb0C. Chemical shifts for the carbons of 1a were calculated at the HF/6-311G* and HF/6-311+G(2d,p) levels, using the GIAO method, to assign peaks to specific carbons. "
"The effect of deuterium substitution on the positional equilibrium and rate of the Cope rearrangement in barbaralone-d1 has been investigated by 1H and 13C dynamic NMR spectroscopy. Deuterium favors the allylic position over the cyclopropyl position. Skewing of the equilibrium requires that the Cope rearrangement be considered as a nonmutual exchange process that transports 13C\xe2\x88\x921H spin pairs between unequally populated molecular configurations. The NMR fast-exchange results are critically interpreted in light of a recently proposed alternative averaging theory (Jones, D. H.; Kurur, N. D.; Weitekamp, D. P. Bull. Magn. Reson. 1992, 14, 214). Our experimental results are consistent with the traditional theory but do not agree with the prediction of the alternative theory. The use of 1H\xe2\x88\x9213C inverse detection is demonstrated for the observation of very broad 13C resonances in the coalescence region via their directly attached exchange-narrowed 1H signals, and the contribution of rapid chemical exchange to the decay of heteronuclear zero- and double-quantum coherence is discussed.

"Pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFGNMR) allows the direct determination of the average value of the axial and transverse apparent dispersion coefficient in a packed bed over a certain volume of this bed. From these data, the dependence of the local value of the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) of a chromatographic column on the fluid velocity can be measured accurately. The results are shown to be exactly accounted for by the Giddings equation. The PFGNMR measurements are made over a very short period of time. Hence they give the value of the HETP averaged over a limited volume of packing and a short time. This value is markedly smaller than the one afforded by the classical methods of chromatography and which is derived from the width of the distribution of the residence time of a small sample. The difference is explained by systematic variations of the local mobile-phase velocity across the column. PFGNMR techniques also allow the determination of the tortuosity of the column packing in the absence of flow. Their results confirm that the apparent dispersion experienced by a molecule is a function of the duration of the observation, until the tortuosity of the packing is completely felt. The values obtained agree very well with those derived from classical chromatography determinations. "
"Adsorption of CH3OH on Cu2O(111), ZnO(0001), and ZnO(1010) has been investigated with XPS, NEXAFS, variable-energy photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), and SCF-X\xce\xb1 Scattered Wave (SW) molecular orbital calculations. At high coverage (\xe2\x89\xa525.0L), CH3OH is adsorbed as molecular multilayers on all three surfaces. At low temperatures (140 K) and coverage (0\xe2\x88\x920.6L), CH3OH is deprotonated to form chemisorbed methoxide on all of the surfaces investigated. Under these conditions the C1s XPS peak positions are 289.5, 290.2, and 290.2 eV below the vacuum level, respectively. Annealing the CH3O-/Cu2O(111) surface complex to 523 K produces no other surface intermediate. Alternatively, at temperatures above 220 K on the ZnO(0001) surface methoxide decomposes to produce a formate intermediate that is stable at the methanol synthesis reaction temperature (523 K). No formate surface intermediate is observed on the ZnO(1010) surface. The NEXAFS spectrum of chemisorbed methoxide on the Cu2O(111) surface exhibits a \xcf\x83* shape resonance at 294.8 eV giving a C\xe2\x88\x92O bond length of 1.41 \xc3\x85, a 0.02 \xc3\x85 contraction from the gas-phase methanol value. Methoxide chemisorbed on the ZnO(0001) surface is found to have a NEXAFS determined C\xe2\x88\x92O bond length of 1.39 \xc3\x85. These bond length contractions of the chemisorbed methoxide are due to the greater polarization of the C\xe2\x88\x92O bond upon deprotonation and surface bonding. Variable-energy PES of the chemisorbed methoxide on Cu2O(111) gives a four peak valence band spectrum, with features at 20.0 (3a\xe2\x80\x98), 15.6 (3a\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98, 5a\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98), 14.0 (\xcf\x83CO), and 10.0 eV (\xcf\x80O, \xcf\x83O), below the vacuum level. SCF-X\xce\xb1-SW molecular orbital calculations indicate that the bonding between the Cu(I) site and the CH3O- is dominated by the \xcf\x80O, \xcf\x83O, and \xcf\x83CO levels, with a calculated \xcf\x83 charge donation from these levels into the empty Cu 4s and Cu 4pz levels of 0.4e. As a consequence of deprotonation and \xcf\x83 donation the carbon atom in CH3O- is calculated to be 0.085e more positive than gas-phase methanol. The variable-energy PES of CH3O- on ZnO(0001) also exhibits four methoxide peaks, at 21.0 (5a\xe2\x80\x98), 16.7 (2a\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98, 5a\xe2\x80\x98), 13.6 (\xcf\x83CO), and 9.8 eV (\xcf\x80O, \xcf\x83O). However, the \xcf\x83 donation is calculated to be less than half that found for CH3O- on the Cu(I) site (0.12e) and with 0.015 greater positive charge on the carbon atom, consistent with the relative binding energies of the C1s peaks and the greater C\xe2\x88\x92O bond contraction. These results show that methoxide bonding to both Cu(I) and Zn(II) surface sites is dominated by \xcf\x83 donation. The electronic and geometric origins of the differences in bonding and reactivity among the Cu(I) and Zn(II) sites are addressed and provide insight into the molecular mechanism of the methanol synthesis reaction.

"Dimer radical cations of methyl chloride have been prepared in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer using a consecutive exchange reaction of the xenon dimer radical cation with methyl chloride. Both theory and experiment have indicated the existence of two different stable methyl chloride dimer radical cations, that is a two-center three-electron (2c/3e) bonded dimer radical cation, CH3Cl\xe2\x88\xb4ClCH3\xe2\x80\xa2+, with C2 symmetry and a methyl chloride chloronium ylidion structure, CH3Cl\xc2\xb7H\xc2\xb7ClCH2\xe2\x80\xa2+, with Cs symmetry. The CH3Cl\xe2\x88\xb4ClCH3\xe2\x80\xa2+ species has been observed to react both as an electron acceptor and as a proton donor. The CH3Cl\xc2\xb7H\xc2\xb7ClCH2\xe2\x80\xa2+ structure, however, reacts only as an electron acceptor. Calculations of the CH3Cl\xe2\x88\xb4ClCH3\xe2\x80\xa2+ structure at the MP2/6-311G(d,p) level of theory indicate a bond dissociation energy of 105.4 kJ mol-1 relative to its ionized and neutral monomer products, while experiments show a bond dissociation energy of 109 \xc2\xb1 5 kJ mol-1. The bond dissociation energy of the CH3Cl\xc2\xb7H\xc2\xb7ClCH2\xe2\x80\xa2+ species has been determined to be 62.8 kJ mol-1 at the MP2/6-311G(d,p) level of theory, whereas experiments indicate 76 kJ mol-1 relative to the radical cation of methyl chloride and its neutral counterpart as products. These results indicate that CH3Cl\xe2\x88\xb4ClCH3\xe2\x80\xa2+ is the intermediate complex in the electron transfer reaction and CH3Cl\xc2\xb7H\xc2\xb7ClCH2\xe2\x80\xa2+ the intermediate complex in the proton transfer reaction between the methyl chloride radical cation and neutral methyl chloride.

"Carbocation intermediates stabilized by a \xce\xb2 silyl group have been characterized, using the silylation of alkenes by R3Si+ ions as a route of formation. Neutral silylated products have been obtained from the reaction of R3Si+ ions, generated in a gaseous medium at atmospheric pressure by a radiolytic technique, with selected alkenes, alkynes, and allene, thereby indicating the occurrence of electrophilic silylation. Notable features of the charged silylated intermediates emerge from the isomeric product distribution. The silylation of cis- and trans-2-butene shows a high degree of retention of configuration, as expected if a bridged species (I) were the reaction intermediate. Alternatively, the intermediacy of an open structure (II), whereby C\xe2\x88\x92C bond rotation is inhibited by the hyperconjugative interaction between the \xce\xb2 silyl group and the vacant p orbital, should be inferred. The charged intermediates from the silylation of alkenes and alkynes are found to be unreactive toward conceivable isomerizations to more stable species, such as the ones bearing the positive charge on silicon. Stereoelectronic factors affect the deprotonation of the silylated intermediates, which may involve loss of the proton from either the \xce\xb1 or the \xce\xb3 position with respect to the silylated carbon. A comparison of the reactivity of alkenes and alkynes in the cationic silylation reaction is presented. "
"Alkanethiolate-coated gold nanocrystals have been laser desorbed from a solid film, ionized, and analyzed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A previously unresolved distribution of peaks is observed and the number of gold and sulfur atoms associated with each feature can be assigned. Alkyl chains are not evident in these high-resolution spectra. Experiments using spatially and temporally separated light pulses demonstrate that more of the desorbed nanocrystals are neutral than are ionized. Pure gold cluster ions of various sizes can be generated from these neutral molecules in the two-laser experiment. "
"The gas-phase structures of tert-butyl vinyl ether, t-BuOC(H)CH2 (t-BVE), and (Z)-methyl 1-propenyl ether, MeOC(H)C(H)Me (Z-MPE), have been studied by gas electron diffraction and ab initio calculations (HF/3-21G and MP2/6-31G*). For both compounds only a single conformer with a slightly nonplanar anti structure of the CC\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92C skeleton was observed. The vibrationally averaged dihedral angles \xcf\x86(CC\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92C) are 167(5)\xc2\xb0 (t-BVE) and 161(5)\xc2\xb0 (Z-MPE), respectively. The experimental scattering intensities are fitted slightly better with dynamic models and double minimum potentials for the internal rotation around the O\xe2\x88\x92C(sp2) bonds. The dihedral angles of the equilibrium structures \xcf\x86e(CC\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92C) are 170(5)\xc2\xb0 for t-BVE and 161(8)\xc2\xb0 for Z-MPE. The potential barriers at the exactly planar anti conformation (\xcf\x86(CC\xe2\x88\x92O\xe2\x88\x92C)=180\xc2\xb0) are V0 = 0.15(10) and 0.20(10) kcal mol-1, respectively. The experimental results are reproduced very well by MP2/6-31G* calculations (\xcf\x86e = 169.0\xc2\xb0 and 154.2\xc2\xb0 and V0 = 0.12 and 0.11 kcal mol-1 for t-BVE and Z-MPE, respectively). The HF/3-21G method, however, predicts a planar structure (\xcf\x86e= 180\xc2\xb0) for t-BVE and an anticlinal structure (\xcf\x86e = 138.7\xc2\xb0) for Z-MPE. "
"An experimental and computational study of ion\xe2\x88\x92molecule association reactions of the methyl halides has been carried out. A two-center three-electron bonded species, [CH3X\xe2\x88\xb4XCH3]\xe2\x80\xa2+, has been observed for I and Br. MS/MS metastable and collision-induced dissociation experiments provide strong support of the atomic connectivity for both species. Computationally, two [C2H6Cl2]\xe2\x80\xa2+ structures have been found:\xe2\x80\x89 the 2c-3e bonded dimer, [CH3Cl\xe2\x88\xb4ClCH3]\xe2\x80\xa2+, and the ylide bound structure, [CH3Cl\xe2\x88\x92H\xe2\x88\x92ClCH2]\xe2\x80\xa2+. Both are supported by the MS/MS results which give evidence of the CH2Cl+, CH3Cl\xe2\x80\xa2+, and CH3ClH+ fragment ions. The study of [C2H6F2]\xe2\x80\xa2+ proved to be somewhat more complicated. Three [C2H6F2]\xe2\x80\xa2+ structures were found computationally:\xe2\x80\x89 the 2c-3e bonded dimer, [CH3F\xe2\x88\xb4FCH3]\xe2\x80\xa2+, a dihydrogen bonded structure, [FH2CH\xe2\x88\x92HCH2F]\xe2\x80\xa2+, and a hydrogen bonded structure, [CH3F\xe2\x88\x92HCH2F]\xe2\x80\xa2+. The F\xe2\x88\x92H bonded species was computed to be the most stable. Kinetic energy release distributions, KERDs, have been measured for all the metastable reaction products and compared with KERD models obtained by using statistical phase space theory. We report here the experimental and theoretical results and the theoretical potential energy surface for all four systems. "
"Comparison is made of the interaction of NO2 with Cu+ ions in the gas phase and inside zeolites using density functional theory (B3LYP functional). The zeolite is represented by a tritetrahedra model embedded in the periodic structure of zeolite ZSM-5 and by a free space cluster model. Both models yield virtually the same results. Cu+ is coordinated to two oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework only. For the complexes with NO2, several minima and transition structures on the potential energy surfaces are localized. The naked Cu+ ion preferentially binds NO2 in the \xce\xb71-O trans mode, while in zeolites the Cu+ site binds NO2 in a 2\xce\xb7-O,O coordination. For the 2\xce\xb7-O,O structure the binding is three to four times stronger in the zeolite (43 kcal/mol) than in the gas phase which is due to a three-body zeolite frameworkCu+ ion\xe2\x88\x92NO2 interaction. d10\xe2\x88\x92s1d9 promotion leads to a more favorable orbital interaction between Cu+ and NO2 in the 2A\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 state and, due to reduced repulsion, to a stronger electrostatic interaction between Cu+ and the zeolite framework.

"Ab initio electronic structure calculations with RHF, MP2, and CCSD(T) wave functions have been used to investigate a reaction path for the hydrosilation reaction catalyzed by divalent titanium (modeled by TiH2). Optimized structures and energies are presented. All levels of theory predict a barrierless reaction path compared to a barrier of 78 kcal/mol for the uncatalyzed reaction. The use of correlated wave functions (MP2 or CCSD(T)) is required to obtain accurate structures and energies. "
"The influence of the zeolite framework type (FAU, CHA, MOR, MFI) and the crystallographic position on the acidity of zeolites is investigated. The most stable Br\xc3\xb8nsted acid sites of the high-silica frameworks are considered:\xe2\x80\x89 O1\xe2\x88\x92H (FAU), O1\xe2\x88\x92H (CHA), Al4\xe2\x88\x92O2(H)\xe2\x88\x92Si (MOR), and Al7\xe2\x88\x92O17(H)\xe2\x88\x92Si4 (MFI, sinusoidal channel). The latter is compared with the less stable Al12-O24(H)-Si12 position (MFI, channel intersection). Both the heat of the deprotonation and the heat of ammonia adsorption are considered as measures of acid strength. A novel hybrid computational scheme is used that combines the quantum mechanical cluster description (QM) of the active site with interatomic potentials (Pot) for the periodic zeolite framework. Specifically, the Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock method (QM) is combined with ab initio shell model potentials (Pot) for the zeolite framework and its interaction with ammonia and ammonium ions. Complete relaxation of the framework is possible within this scheme and long-range corrections to the reaction energies are obtained from the shell model potentials. The total QM-Pot reaction energies are remarkably stable with increasing cluster size. The calculated heats of deprotonation suggest the acidity sequence Y (1171 kJ/mol) > CHA (1190 kJ/mol) > MOR (1195 kJ/mol) > ZSM-5 (1200 kJ/mol), which is neither explained by local structure effects nor by crystal potential effects alone. The calculated heats of NH3 adsorption suggest the sequence MOR > CHA \xe2\x89\x88 Y > ZSM-5. The different order is caused by specific interactions of NH4+ with the negatively charged catalyst surface. The predicted heats of NH3 adsorption are \xe2\x88\x92119, \xe2\x88\x92114, \xe2\x88\x92113, and \xe2\x88\x92109 kJ/mol, respectively. Comparison is made with microcalorimetry and TPD data. "
"The work of Pechukas [J. Chem. Phys. 1976, 64, 1515\xe2\x88\x921521] on predicting transtion structure symmetry from reactant and product symmetries is extended to degenerate reactions. Pechukas showed that the group of the transition structure in a one-step nondegenerate reaction must be one of the Pechukas groups common to reactant and product. It is now shown that for a one-step degenerate reaction the transition structure symmetry must either be that of one of the Pechukas groups as predicted for a nondegenerate reaction or a group constructed from one of them by adding \xe2\x80\x9cextra\xe2\x80\x9d symmetry operations to double its order. Several examples are given to clarify these rules, and a table is presented to aid in their application. "
"The integrated molecular orbital\xe2\x88\x92molecular mechanics (IMOMM) method adopting the B3LYP:MM3 combination has been used to study the full catalysts in the diimine\xe2\x88\x92M (M = Ni, Pd) catalyzed ethylene polymerization reaction. These results have been compared with previous molecular orbital calculations on model systems (model). There is a lowering of the migratory insertion activation barriers when including substituent effects from 9.9 (model) to 3.8 (IMOMM) kcal/mol for nickel and from 16.2 (model) to 14.1 (IMOMM) kcal/mol for palladium. Steric interactions decrease the complexation energy which leads to a lowering of the barrier. The \xce\xb2-H transfer process which involves the reaction n-propyl \xce\xb2-agostic \xe2\x86\x92 olefin hydride \xe2\x86\x92 isopropyl \xce\xb2-agostic is the likely mechanism leading to branching of polyethylenes. In the nickel system, the olefin\xe2\x88\x92hydride intermediate lies 13.6 (model) or 14.5 (IMOMM) kcal/mol above the n-propyl \xce\xb2-agostic species, indicating that this pathway is unlikely for unsubstituted or substituted nickel diimine catalysts. For palladium, where the olefin\xe2\x88\x92hydride intermediate resided 5.4 kcal/mol above the \xce\xb2-agostic species in model B3LYP predictions, IMOMM reduces this difference to almost zero, suggesting branching to be more prominent with bulky substituents. Although \xce\xb2-H transfer is more likely for substituted palladium, the formation of the 5-coordinate intermediate is not possible due to steric effects and thus an associative chain termination process is not possible for substituted palladium while it likely can occur for unsubstituted Pd catalysts.

"The total synthesis of asialo GM1 (1a) has been accomplished. Using related chemistry, the methyl glycoside of the asialo compound (1b) has also been synthesized. These kinds of compounds have been identified as potential ligands for bacterial and viral infection sites. A simpler structure, which has also been identified for its infection attracting structure in the context of glycopeptides and glycolipids (methyl glycoside 2), has also been synthesized. The key common phase in the syntheses involves the sulfonamidoglycosidation reaction which is used to create a \xce\xb2-linkage leading to a galNAc residue joined to the C4 hydroxyl group of a galactose unit either as a monosaccharide (see compound 2) or as C4\xe2\x80\x98 in the context of a lactosyl moiety. During the course of these studies there was encountered an unusual \xe2\x80\x9cproximal hydroxyl\xe2\x80\x9d directing effect. Thus, when C4 on the galactose ring of an azaglycosylating donor bears a free hydroxyl (see, for instance, compound 13), \xce\xb2-glycoside formation predominates. When this hydroxyl group is blocked, the process tends in the direction of \xce\xb1-glycoside formation (see compound 32). These findings were explained as arising from a critical intramolecular hydrogen bond between the C4 axial hydroxyl of the galactose donor and its proximal pyranosidal ring oxygen. This interaction stabilizes conformations from which \xce\xb2-glycosidation predominates. "
"A concise and potentially practical synthesis of the title compound has been achieved. The route features a high degree of convergence and economy of synthetic operations. A key step is the concurrent introductory addition of three \xce\xb1-l-fucosyl residues at required hydroxyl acceptor sites (see 37 \xe2\x86\x92 39). Conjugation to carrier protein was achieved, and a route to include truncated structures for investigations for antibody specificity was accomplished. "
"Three series of zeroth to second generation chiral dendrimers, 7\xe2\x88\x929, 10\xe2\x88\x9212, and 13\xe2\x88\x9215, were prepared by convergent methods using chiral, nonracemic AB2 monomers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Chiroptical data revealed a significant change in molar rotation per subunit ([\xce\xa6]D/n) as dendrimer generation increased for dendrimers 7\xe2\x88\x929 and 10\xe2\x88\x9212, but not for dendrimers 13\xe2\x88\x9215, a possible indication of chiral conformational order in the former two series of dendrimers, but not in the last. However, the optical activities ([\xce\xa6]D) of low-molecular-weight model compounds 16 (+262) and 17 (+122), prepared to simulate different regions of the dendrimer structure, suggest that as generation size increases slight constitutional changes have a strong effect on the chiroptical properties of the dendrimer subunits. Using the [\xce\xa6]D values of these and other (18\xe2\x88\x9223) low-molecular-weight model compounds, we calculated [\xce\xa6]D values for dendrimers 7\xe2\x88\x9215 that agree within 14% of the observed values. Agreement between the optical activity of the model compounds and the dendrimers leads to the conclusion that the conformational equilibria of the dendrimer subunits are not perturbed relative to those of the model compounds. Therefore, we interpreted the change in [\xce\xa6]D/n as dendrimer generation increased for dendrimers 7\xe2\x88\x9212 to be based solely on constitutional changes in the dendritic structure and not chiral conformational order.

"The design and multistep convergent synthesis of the novel photoactive ubiquinol-benzoin adduct 1a,b has been accomplished. Optical spectra of the steady-state photolysis reactions showed a smooth conversion from 1a,b to 5,7-dimethoxy-2-phenylbenzofuran (13) and ubiquinol-2 with an isobestic point at 258 nm. HPLC analysis of the photoproducts was also consistent with the clean formation of the desired ubiquinol-2 (3) and the expected 5,7-dimethoxy-2-phenylbenzofuran (2). Transient photolysis at 355 nm was consistent with a rapid photolysis rate that exceeded the instrument response time (>106 s-1). Accordingly, the study of rapid electron-transfer events in ubiquinol oxidizing enzymes is now feasible. Furthermore, the synthetic methods developed herein will be of general application for the facile synthesis of a variety of photoreleasable substrates for studying rapid kinetic events in enzymatic reactions.

"Multilayer protein films in which avidin or streptavidin is used as a cross-linking agent are widely used in bioanalytical laboratories for diagnostics, isolation, and localization. However, comparatively little is known about the structure of these films. In this study, molecular orientation in asymmetric protein bilayers assembled on planar glass substrates was investigated. The multilayer architecture consisted of, in order of deposition, a biotin capped phospholipid bilayer, streptavidin, and yeast cytochrome c biotinylated at cysteine 102. The orientation distribution of the heme groups in the cytochrome c layer was determined using a combination of absorption linear dichroism, measured in a planar integrated optical waveguide-attenuated total reflection geometry, and fluorescence anisotropy, measured in a total internal reflection geometry. A Gaussian model for the orientation distribution was used to recover the mean heme tilt angle and angular distribution about the mean. The orientation distribution for the biotinylated cytochrome c layer was 41 \xc2\xb1 11 degrees, which is nearly identical to the orientation distribution measured previously for yeast cytochrome c covalently immobilized via cysteine 102 to pyridyl-capped phospholipid bilayers.12 In that case, the cytochrome surface coverage was 0.9 monolayer. In the present study the cytochrome surface coverage was only 0.4 monolayer, which likely precluded lateral interactions between protein molecules. The fact that the orientation distributions were nearly identical shows that lateral interactions are not required to form a macroscopically oriented protein film. "
"Zirconacyclopentadienes reacted with acetylenecarboxylates in the presence of a stoichiometric amount (2 equiv) of copper chloride to give benzene derivatives in high yields along with the formation of a copper mirror on the wall of the reaction vessel. Reactions of unsymmetrical zirconacyclopentadienes prepared from two different alkynes with acetylenecarboxylates gave benzene derivatives from three different alkynes in high yields with high selectivities. Preparation of unsymmetrical zirconacyclopentadienes and benzene derivatives formation can be done in one-pot. The structure of the reaction product of the unsymmetrical zirconacyclopentadiene having a trimethylsilyl group and a methyl group in the \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-position, respectively, with acetylenedicarboxylate was determined by X-ray analysis. It indicated that the regiochemistry of those substituents was maintained during the reaction. When the coupling reaction of zirconacyclopentadienes with acetylenedicarboxylate in the presence of copper chloride was carried out at \xe2\x88\x9278 \xc2\xb0C, linear trienes were obtained as the intermediates in high yields after hydrolysis. Warming the mixture without hydrolysis gave the desired benzene derivatives in high yields. Use of an unsymmetrical zirconacyclopentadiene afforded a mixture of two isomers of the linear triene as intermediates after hydrolysis. When the mixture of the two isomers was warmed to room temperature without hydrolysis, both isomers gave the same benzene derivative. In the presence of a catalytic amount of copper chloride (10 mol %), this cycloaddition proceeded to give benzene derivatives in good yields without formation of the copper mirror. The reaction under the catalytic conditions at \xe2\x88\x9278 \xc2\xb0C also gave a linear triene after hydrolysis. "
"In the palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation of (E)-3-substituted-2-propenyl acetates (1), 1-substituted-2-propenyl acetates (2), and 1- or 3-deuterio-2-cyclohexenyl acetate (5), which proceeds through 1,3-unsymmetrically substituted \xcf\x80-allylpalladium intermediates, selective substitution at the position originally substituted with acetate was observed by use of a sterically bulky monodentate phosphine ligand, 2-(diphenylphosphino)-2\xe2\x80\x98-methoxy-1,1\xe2\x80\x98-binaphthyl (MeO-MOP). Studies of the structure of \xcf\x80-allylpalladium complexes generated by mixing [PdCl(\xcf\x80-cyclohexenyl)]2 with 1 or 2 equiv of MeO-MOP (L*) revealed that cationic bisphosphine complex [Pd(L*)2(\xcf\x80-cyclohexenyl)]+Cl- is not formed even in the presence of excess ligand but neutral monophosphine complex PdCl(L*)(\xcf\x80-cyclohexenyl) (11) is formed, leaving excess ligand free, and that the exchange of the coordination site of Cl and L* in 11 is much slower than that in triphenylphosphine complex PdCl(PPh3)(\xcf\x80-cyclohexenyl) (13). The slow exchange can rationalize the retention of regiochemistry in the allylic alkylation catalyzed by palladium/MeO-MOP complex. "
"Rate constants for cyanohydrin formation in aqueous solution can be predicted, with no use of kinetics information, by the application of a simple model requiring only equilibrium constants and distortion energies for the species involved in the reaction. The detailed model for cyanohydrin formation involves two reaction coordinates:\xe2\x80\x89 C\xe2\x88\x92C bond formation, which would lead to a cyanohydrin with an orthogonal geometry, and conversion of the carbonyl center from sp2 to sp3. Allowance must be made for the necessary desolvation of cyanide ion before C\xe2\x88\x92C bond formation begins and for the initial partial desolvation of the newly formed cyanohydrin anion. The energies of the \xe2\x80\x9ccorner intermediates\xe2\x80\x9d can be calculated, and then the rest of the surface can be deduced using an assumed interpolation formula. With distortion energies derived from semiempirical or ab initio molecular orbital calculations and overall energy changes based on experimental equilibrium constants, and with the assumption of a quadratic dependence of energy on reaction coordinates, the literature data for rate constants for cyanohydrin formation in solution can be matched for a representative selection of compounds spanning the reactivity range which has been studied.

"CCSD(T)/6-311G** electronic structure calculations confirm the experimentally postulated existence of cyclopentadienylidenecarbene (CPDC) and verify the reliability of the BLYP/6-311G** predictions for thermochemistry and kinetics of the 1,2-didehydrogenation of arenes and the ring contraction of the resulting arynes. The former process is found to possess low site specificity, its energetics being influenced mostly by steric overcrowding of hydrogens. On the other hand, the energetics and barriers of rearrangements of higher arynes to annelated CPDCs are determined by the nature of bonding in the reaction products. Three distinct types of isomerizations, of which only one is observed experimentally, are readily recognizable. "
"Chlorocarbonyl(phenyl)ketene (2) undergoes a degenerate 1,3-shift of chlorine, as determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The two carbonyl signals (183 and 157 ppm) coalesce at \xe2\x88\x9230 \xc2\xb0C, and from this as well as line-shape analysis, an activation barrier for the 1,3-Cl shift interconverting 2a and 2a\xe2\x80\x98 of \xce\x94G\xe2\x80\xa1 = 41.8 \xc2\xb1 4 kJ mol-1 (10.0 \xc2\xb1 1 kcal mol-1) is calculated. These data are in excellent agreement with calculated (G2(MP2,SVP) and B3-LYP/6311+G(3df,2p)//6-31G* + ZPVE) 1,3-Cl shift and rotational barriers. Analogous 1,3-halogen shifts in acyl isocyanates are predicted. "
" An induced circular dichroism (CD) spectrum is observed for 1,1\xe2\x80\x98,3,3,3\xe2\x80\x98,3\xe2\x80\x98-hexamethyl-9-phenyl-indocarbocyanine, 1,1\xe2\x80\x98-diethyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-cyanine, 1,1\xe2\x80\x98-di-(3,5-di-tert-butyl)benzyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-cyanine, or 1,1\xe2\x80\x98-di-(4-tert-butyl)benzyl-2,2\xe2\x80\x98-cyanine when penetrated into a chiral cavity of either spirobi[(2-methyl)borataxanthene] or spirobi[(3-methyl)borataxanthene]. Within the ion pair, the cyanine dye exists in two (or more) interconverting conformations of unequal energy. Solid-state structural evidence suggests that a nitrogen-forward mode for penetration by the cyanine dominates the solution behavior. A critical feature for the observation of induced circular dichroism is that the dye is twisted in the ground state. The free energy difference between the diastereomers with right- and left-handed twist in the chiral cavity of the borate is less than 1 kcal/mol, but this is sufficient to induce the CD spectrum. The magnitude of the observed CD spectrum is dependent on the structure of both the cyanine and borate. "
"The lithium salt of carbazole, LiCb, is monomeric in THF in the concentration range (1\xe2\x88\x925) \xc3\x97 10-3 M. It is a contact ion pair (CIP) with an effective ion pair pK of 13.48 on a scale where fluorenyllithium solvent separated ion pairs (SSIP) are 22.90 (per hydrogen). The cesium salt, CsCb, is a mixture of monomer and dimer with K2 = 300 M-1. The monomer forms a 1:1 complex, CsCb\xc2\xb7CbH, with Kc = 62 M-1. The ion pair pK of monomeric CsCb is 19.24. "
"A new synthetic method for functionalized cyclopentanones was developed on the basis of a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of a 1-(methylthio)-2-siloxyallyl cationic species and olefins. Allyl acetates 1a and 1b, which are the precursors of the allyl cationic species, are easily prepared in three or four steps from commercially available compounds. Under the influence of EtAlCl2 or AlCl3, 1a or 1b reacted with various kinds of olefins such as enol ethers, vinyl sulfides, styrenes, and trialkylolefins to afford the corresponding cyclopentanones in good yields. It is noteworthy that the sterically more hindered regioisomer was predominantly formed in every case. Furthermore, the reactions of 1b with vinyl sulfides exhibited surprisingly high stereoselectivity, which can be rationalized by the six-membered transition state models involving an orbital interaction between the sulfur atom of the vinyl sulfide and the \xce\xb1-carbon of the allyl cation.

"A new strategy toward glycosidase inhibitors, represented by valienamine, which is such an inhibitor itself as well as a critical unit of pseudooligosaccharides that function this way, evolved from two newly developed palladium-catalyzed reactions. The applicability of a palladium(0)-catalyzed net regioselective cis-hydroxyamination derives from the reaction of vinyl epoxides with isocyanates. The utilization of a cocatalyst in this reaction is required in this case and may prove generally useful. A bidentate phosphite proved to be the most effective ligand. The requisite substrate was available via a Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder protocol and allowed the obtention of (\xc2\xb1)-valienamine in only seven steps. The inability to perform the Diels\xe2\x88\x92Alder reaction asymmetrically led to a different asymmetric synthesis of the pivotal epoxide intermediate in enantiomerically pure form, which derived from asymmetric palladium-catalyzed reactions. Using the desymmetrization of meso enedicarboxylates, the net equivalence of an asymmetric cis-hydroxycarboxylation led to the enantiomerically pure desired epoxide. (+)-Valienamine was available in 14 steps by this route. "
"A sequence, based on a Mitsunobu displacement at the hydroxymethyl position of deuterium-labeled, N-substituted 2-(hydroxymethyl)pyrroles, is reported as a general procedure to determine the ability of the N-substituent to deactivate the heterocycle. An SN2 mechanism, in this reaction, has been shown to be favored over reaction via an azafulvenium intermediate, by employing N-(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl as the deactivating group. Deuterium-labeling studies have demonstrated that suppression of contributions to the reaction from an azafulvenium intermediate is less effective with other deactivating groups, and the order for deactivation is triflyl > mesyl > BOC \xe2\x89\x88 acetyl. The attachment of an electron-withdrawing group onto the nitrogen of a 2-formyl[formyl-d]pyrrole has also been shown to allow reduction to give a 2-(hydroxymethyl[methylene-d1])pyrrole of high configurational purity. The utility of the N-triflyl group to deactivate a pyrrole was demonstrated with the preparation of deuterium-labeled porphobilinogen precursor. "
"The highly stereoselective total synthesis of the phytoalexin (\xc2\xb1)-lubiminol (1) has been accomplished. The synthesis relies on three pivotal transformations:\xe2\x80\x89 (1) a conjugate addition\xe2\x88\x92cyclization reaction to prepare a highly functionalized 2-carbomethoxycyclopentenone as a photocycloaddition substrate, (2) a double diastereoselective intramolecular photocycloaddition for a stereoselective intramolecular photoaddition reaction which establishes the central quaternary spirocenter, and (3) the transformation of the photoadduct into the required spiro[5.4]decane through a radical fragmentation\xe2\x88\x92rearrangement reaction.

"This contribution describes catalytic tandem C\xe2\x88\x92N and C\xe2\x88\x92C bond-forming reactions involving the intramolecular hydroamination/bicyclization and intermolecular hydroamination/cyclization of olefins and alkynes using the organolanthanide complexes Cp\xe2\x80\x982LnCH(SiMe3)2 and Me2SiCp\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x982LnCH(SiMe3)2 (Cp\xe2\x80\x98 = \xce\xb75-Me5C5; Cp\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98 = \xce\xb75-Me4C5; Ln = lanthanide) as precatalysts. In the case of the intramolecular processes, substrates of the structures RC\xe2\x8b\xaeC(CH2)aNH(CH2)bC\xe2\x8b\xaeCR, RC\xe2\x8b\xaeC(CH2)cNH(CH2)dCHCH2, and H2CCH\xe2\x88\x92(CH2)eNH(CH2)fCHCH2 are regiospecifically bicyclized to the corresponding pyrrolizidine and indolizidine skeletons, with turnover frequencies ranging from 2 to 777 h-1 at 21 \xc2\xb0C and isolated product yields ranging from 85 to 93%. In the case of e = 3 and f = 1 mediated by Cp\xe2\x80\x982Sm\xe2\x88\x92, the kinetic rate law is zero-order in substrate concentration and first-order in lanthanide concentration. In the case of R = Ph, c = 3, and d = 1, the Cp\xe2\x80\x982Ln-catalyzed turnover frequencies fall precipitously with decreasing Ln+3 ionic radius. In the intermolecular processes, substrates of the type HC\xe2\x8b\xaeCCH2NHR undergo regiospecific coupling and cyclization to the corresponding pyrroles with high turnover frequencies where R and Nt (h-1) are the following:\xe2\x80\x89 CH2CHCH2, 236 (60 \xc2\xb0C); CH3CH2CH2, 208 (60 \xc2\xb0C); CH2CHCH2CH2CH2, 58 (60 \xc2\xb0C). In addition, hydroamination/cyclization processes after intermolecular insertion can be effected when R = CH2CHCH2, to afford a 2,7-dimethyldipyrrolo[1,2-a:1\xe2\x80\x98,2\xe2\x80\x98-d]pyrazine derivative via two successive intramolecular olefin insertion processes. The mechanism for such tandem C\xe2\x88\x92N and C\xe2\x88\x92C bond formations is postulated to involve turnover-limiting intra- or intermolecular alkene/alkyne insertion into the Ln\xe2\x88\x92N functionality, followed by rapid intramolecular insertion of a pendant CC/C\xe2\x8b\xaeC-containing functionality into the resulting Ln\xe2\x88\x92C bond (prior to protonolysis). Such a scenario is consistent with well-documented, stepwise transformations in organo-f-element-catalyzed insertions of unsaturated carbon\xe2\x88\x92carbon multiple bonds into metal\xe2\x88\x92amide and metal\xe2\x88\x92alkyl functionalities.

"Reaction enthalpies of group 4 metallocenes having the general formula L2M(CH3)2 (L = Cp, 1,2-Me2Cp, Me5Cp; L2 = Me2Si(Me4Cp)(tBuN); M = Ti, Zr, and Hf) with the strong organo-Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 were measured using batch titration calorimetry in toluene. Methide abstraction to form the corresponding L2MCH3+CH3B(C6F5)3- contact ion pairs is highly exothermic in all cases. Exothermicity increases with increasing Cp methyl substitution:\xe2\x80\x89 for M = Zr, \xce\x94H = \xe2\x88\x9223.1(3), \xe2\x88\x9224.3(4), and \xe2\x88\x9236.7(5) kcal mol-1 for L = Cp, Me2Cp, and Me5Cp, respectively. For M = Hf and L = 1,2-Me2Cp, \xce\x94H = \xe2\x88\x9220.8(5) kcal mol-1. \xe2\x80\x9cConstrained geometry\xe2\x80\x9d complexes (L2 = Me2Si(Me4Cp)(tBuN)) exhibit similar exothermicities, with \xce\x94H = \xe2\x88\x9222.6(2), \xe2\x88\x9223.9(4), and \xe2\x88\x9219.3(6) kcal mol-1 for M = Ti, Zr, and Hf, respectively. In contrast, analogous reactions with methylalumoxane (M:Al = 1:50) are less exothermic, with \xce\x94H = \xe2\x88\x9210.9(3) and \xe2\x88\x928.9(4) kcal mol-1 for L = 1,2-Me2Cp and M = Zr and Hf, respectively. Under identical conditions, (1,2-Me2Cp)2M(CH3)2 (M = Zr, Hf) complexes also undergo methide abstraction with the less Lewis-acidic triarylboranes (C6F5)2BAr (Ar = 3,5-C6H3F2, Ph, and 3,5-C6H3Me2); however, conversions to the corresponding (Me2Cp)2MCH3+ CH3B(C6F5)2Ar- ion pairs are incomplete. Variable-temperature NMR measurements yield thermodynamic parameters for partial methide abstraction by these less Lewis-acidic boranes. For Ar = 3,5-C6H3F2, \xce\x94H = \xe2\x88\x9218.7(7) and \xe2\x88\x9215.2(8) kcal mol-1 with \xce\x94S = \xe2\x88\x9242(2) and \xe2\x88\x9235(3) e.u.; for Ar = Ph, \xce\x94H = \xe2\x88\x9214.8(8) and \xe2\x88\x9213.3(6) kcal mol-1 with \xce\x94S = \xe2\x88\x9231(2) and \xe2\x88\x9239(2) e.u.; for Ar = 3,5-C6H3Me2, \xce\x94H = \xe2\x88\x9210.8(6) and \xe2\x88\x9212.7(5) with \xce\x94S = \xe2\x88\x9219(2) and \xe2\x88\x9236(4) e.u., in each case for M = Zr and Hf, respectively. Dynamic NMR analyses reveal that the activation barriers for methide abstraction from the neutral metallocene dialkyls are small and relatively insensitive to the borane identity (\xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 = 2\xe2\x88\x926 kcal mol-1) while ion-pair separation/recombination processes are greatly facilitated by polar solvents. Ethylene polymerization activities for eight (Me2Cp)2MCH3+ CH3B(C6F5)2Ar- complexes measured in toluene solution (25 \xc2\xb0C, 1 atm) follow a trend in metal (Zr > Hf) as well as a substantial trend in triarylborane (Ar = C6F5 > 3,5-C6H3F2 > Ph \xe2\x88\xbc 3,5-C6H3Me2). Polymerization activities correlate roughly with MCH3+ 13C NMR chemical shifts and enthalpies of methide abstraction. "
"The aromatic ring current probe, the bridged [14]annulene dimethyldihydropyrene, 1, is used to investigate the bond localization effects of the organometallic species tricarbonylchromiumbenzene, 37, hexamethylbenzenerutheniumbenzene, 38, tricarbonylmanganesecyclopentadienyl, 40, and pentamethylcyclopentadienylrutheniumcyclopentadienyl, 39, when fused to the annulene. Benzo[a]dimethyldihydropyrene 2 was converted to the two isomers of its tricarbonylchromium complex, 9 and 10, in 60% yield using ligand exchange with naphthalene and to its hexamethylbenzene\xe2\x88\x92ruthenium complexes 11 and 12 with [RuCl2(HMB)]2 and AgBF4. The cyclopentadienide fused dihydropyrene 5 was synthesized from dimethyldihydropyrene 1 in eight steps, and then on reaction with pentacarbonyl manganese bromide gave the tricarbonylmanganese complex of 5, as two isomers 28 and 29 in 61% yield, and with (Cp*RuCl2)n gave 70% yield of the dihydropyrene annelated ruthenocene isomers 26 and 27. Bis(tricarbonylchromium) complexes 32\xe2\x88\x9234 were obtained in 50% yield from the dibenzannulene 30. The 1H NMR spectra for each complex were analyzed in detail with regard to ring current shielding of the internal methyl protons and ring current deshielding of the external protons. The McGlinchey equation was used to remove diamagnetic anisotropy effects, and the resultant chemical shift values were consistent with coupling constant results, which together yielded bond fixation data of the annulene, caused by the organometallic. The relative bond fixing ability of the organometallics was found to be in the order:\xe2\x80\x89 Cp\xe2\x88\x92Ru\xe2\x88\x92Cp* > benzene\xe2\x88\x92Ru2+\xe2\x88\x92(HMB) > Cp\xe2\x88\x92Mn(CO)3 > benzene\xe2\x88\x92Cr(CO)3 > benzene. Alternance parameter evidence is presented that the complexes are aromatic, and the authors discuss the relative aromaticity of the complexes to benzene. "
"Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out on a number of compounds in which multiple bonds are formed by or between main group elements. The calculated and observed structures agree very well for P2, P4, P\xe2\x8b\xaeC\xe2\x88\x92R, R\xe2\x88\x92PP\xe2\x88\x92R, As\xe2\x8b\xaeC\xe2\x88\x92R, R\xe2\x88\x92AsAs\xe2\x88\x92R\xe2\x80\x98, R\xe2\x88\x92BiBi\xe2\x88\x92R, and R2\xe2\x88\x92GeGe\xe2\x88\x92R2. For a recently reported compound alleged to contain a Ga\xe2\x8b\xaeGa (triple) bond the calculations point to a different formulation in which there is only a double bond and a significant role for noncovalent interactions.

"The magnetic properties of spinel nanoparticles are determined by crystal chemistry issues such as cation distribution and oxidation states. The cation distribution and oxidation state of Mn\xe2\x88\x92Fe spinel nanoparticles have been systematically studied at various temperatures by using neutron diffraction and electron energy loss spectroscopy, respectively. The Mn\xe2\x88\x92Fe spinel nanoparticles prepared by coprecipitation have a high degree of inversion with 61% of the tetrahedral sites occupied by Fe3+ cations. The degree of inversion correlates with the distribution expected from random occupancy of cations consisting of Fe (60%) and Mn (40%). After heat treatment in a vacuum, the cation distribution reaches an equilibrium state with a 29% inversion. Initially, one-half of the Mn cations are in the +3 oxidation state and the other half are in the +2 oxidation state. Mn3+ cations are slowly and irreversibly reduced to Mn2+ with increasing temperature. When the temperature approaches 600 \xc2\xb0C, all Mn cations are in the +2 state. These results provide direct evidence for the temperature-dependent change of crystal chemistry in Mn\xe2\x88\x92Fe spinel nanoparticles, which has been closely related with the controversy on attributing the changes in the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles to crystallite size effect. These results will also provide an understanding of how to control crystal chemistry in order to control the properties of these magnetic nanoparticles. "
"The properties of the carbon sulfide C6S8 (1) as well as its dioxo analogue C6S6O2 (2) have been studied in the fully oxidized and fully reduced forms, i.e., 10, 1,2- 20, 22-. A crystallographic study shows that compound 2 is a tricyclic species with a twisted 1,2-dithiin (unsaturated C4S2 ring) core. Reduction of 1 with 2 equiv of LiBHEt3 gave C6S82- (12-), which was isolated as its PPh4+ salt. A crystallographic study of this salt shows that reduction has resulted in cleavage of the S\xe2\x88\x92S bond and that, in the solid state, the dihedral angle between the two rings is 180\xc2\xb0. Both 12- and 22- undergo two sequential and reversible 1e- oxidations near 0 V (vs Ag/AgCl), thus establishing that 10 and 20 are good oxidants relative to other disulfides. Treatment of (PPh4)2[C6S8] with [Ni(H2O)6]Cl2 afforded the dark red (PPh4)2[Ni(C6S8)2] (3). The analogous Pt complex (4) was also prepared. Crystallographic analysis of 3 shows that the nickel center is square planar, comprising two seven-membered NiS2C4 rings. The paramagnetism observed for solutions of 3 are attributed to the formation of a tetrahedral isomer. "
"The synthesis and properties of [cis-Ru(dppm)2(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCFc)2]CuI (dppm = Ph2PCH2PPh2, Fc = ferrocenyl) (1) and trans,trans,trans-Ru(PBu3)2(CO)(L)(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCFc)2 (3, L = CO; 4, L = pyridine; 5, L = P(OMe)3) are reported. The ruthenium bisacetylide bridges in these complexes allow electronic interaction between the terminal ferrocenyl groups. The interaction is enhanced when the ancillary ligands on the ruthenium center are electron donors and lessened when the ligands are acceptors. Complex 1 was prepared in 70% yield by the coupling of FcC\xe2\x8b\xaeCSn(n-Bu)3 and cis- or trans-RuCl2(dppm)2 in the presence of excess CuI and was crystallographically characterized. Removal of the coordinated CuI from 1 with excess P(OMe)3 yields trans-Ru(dppm)2(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCFc)2 (2). Reaction of 2 with CuI yields 1. trans,trans,trans-Ru(PBu3)2(CO)2(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCFc)2 (3) was synthesized from RuCl2(CO)2(PBu3)2 and FcC\xe2\x8b\xaeCSn(n-Bu)3 using a CuI catalyst and was crystallographically characterized. Reaction of 3 with excess pyridine yields trans,trans,trans-Ru(PBu3)2(CO)(py)(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCFc)2 (4). The reaction is reversible; 3 may be obtained by reacting 4 with excess carbon monoxide. Reaction of 4 with P(OMe)3 yields trans,trans,trans-Ru(PBu3)2(CO)(P(OMe)3)(C\xe2\x8b\xaeCFc)2 (5). Dications of all the complexes were prepared by oxidation with 2 equiv of FcPF6, and monocations were prepared in solution by reaction of the neutral complexes with the dications. The difference between the first and second ferrocenyl oxidations (\xce\x94E1/2) in the cyclic voltammograms of 1, 3, 4, and 5 are 0.14, 0.09, 0.13, and 0.15 V, respectively. Characterization of the complexes by visible, IR, and near-IR spectroscopy supports the conclusion that the ligand environment of the ruthenium center affects the extent of electronic delocalization between the ferrocenyl groups.

"A correlation between the orientation of [TCNE]\xe2\x80\xa2- (TCNE = tetracyanoethylene) bound to a [MnIII(por)]+ (por = substituted meso-tetraphenylporphyrin) and the magnitude of magnetic coupling for a series of previously prepared [Mn(por)][TCNE]\xc2\xb72PhMe linear-chain molecule-based ferrimagnets has been identified. The tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP), tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)porphyrin (H2TClPP), tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)porphyrin (H2TOMePP), tetrakis(2-fluorophenyl)porphyrin (H2TFPP), and tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin (H2TP\xe2\x80\x98P) ligands have all been utilized. Previous structural determinations as the ditoluene solvates indicate that the Mn\xe2\x88\x92N distance varies \xe2\x88\xbc2.6%, while the Mn\xe2\x88\x92(N\xe2\x88\x92C)TCNE bond angle varies by as much as 25.2% from the mean values over this series of compounds. Hence the overlap between the [TCNE]\xe2\x80\xa2- \xcf\x80* SOMO and the MnIII SOMO d orbitals plays a significant role in controlling the magnetic properties. From molecular orbital overlap considerations, as determined from semiempirical INDO/SCF calculations, the expected d\xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80* (d\xcf\x80 = dxz, dyz) overlap is not as important as the \xcf\x83-dz2\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80* overlap between MnIII and the [TCNE]\xe2\x80\xa2-. Furthermore, the greater the deviation from 90\xc2\xb0 for the dihedral angle between the mean MnN4 [Mn(por)]+ plane and the [TCNE]\xe2\x80\xa2- mean plane increases the \xcf\x83\xe2\x88\x92dz2/pz overlap between MnIII and the [TCNE]\xe2\x80\xa2- leading to an increased intrachain coupling as the angle is decreased. An increase in the Tmin (the temperature at which the minima in the temperature dependence of the moment occurs) is observed as this angle becomes more acute, reflecting the stronger magnetic coupling. This suggests systems with smaller Mn(por)+/[TCNE]\xe2\x80\xa2- dihedral and Mn\xe2\x88\x92(N\xe2\x88\x92C)TCNE bond angles should have enhanced intrachain magnetic coupling, Jintra, leading to higher Tc\'s. Pressure may force such systems to have reduced angles and also lead to higher Tc\'s. "
"Laser flash photolysis with time-resolved infrared detection of transients (LFP-TRIR) has been used to study the IR spectroscopy and reactivity of a number of substituted ketenes, prepared by the 308-nm photolysis of \xce\xb1-diazocarbonyl precursors in acetonitrile solution at room temperature. The correlation of the experimental ketene asymmetric stretching frequency to the Swain\xe2\x88\x92Lupton field (F) and resonance (R) effect substituent parameters was unsatisfactory, whereas the correlation to the inductive substituent parameter (\xcf\x83I) of Charton gave excellent results. This suggests that the asymmetric stretching frequency of substituted ketenes depends mainly on the inductive (i.e., field) effect of the substituents. The mechanism and kinetics of the reactions of these ketenes with various amines in acetonitrile were also studied. An intermediate species identified as either zwitterionic ylide or amide enol formed in the nucleophilic addition of the secondary amine to the C\xce\xb1 of the ketene is observed by TRIR. The decay of this species is assisted by the amine and is concomitant with the formation of an amide, the final product of the reaction. Our kinetic data on ketene amine reactions show a general trend, indicating a much higher reactivity (ca. 3 orders of magnitude difference in the corresponding rate constants) of secondary amines compared with that of tertiary amines. Secondary diethylamine shows reactivity similar to those observed for primary amines, while secondary piperidine seems to be, in general, somewhat more reactive. The observed trend is rationalized in terms of the steric effects exerted by both amine and ketene substituents. Our data on para-substituted phenyl ketenes provide support for the negative charge development on the ketene moiety in the transition state, with electron-withdrawing substituents accelerating and electron-releasing substituents slowing down the addition reaction. "
"The enediynes 1 and 2 were photolyzed in 2-propanol to yield products akin to those analogous to a thermal Bergman cyclization mechanism. In addition, products resulting from photoreduction of one of the triple bonds of the enediyne functionality are also formed. The product distributions and yields were found to be dependent on the substituents on the triple bonds and on the nature of the double bond; in particular, phenyl substituents on the triple bonds eliminated the photoreduction products, and overall yields were higher when the double bond of the enediyne was of aromatic character. Triplet sensitization studies and laser flash photolysis experiments point toward radical mechanisms taking place during formation of both classes of products, with the photoreduction products forming from the excited triplet state and the cyclized naphthyl products forming from either the singlet or the triplet states. For the cyclization reaction, a substituted 1,4-dehydronaphthalene biradical species, structurally identical to a hypothetical Bergman biradical, is suggested to be the most likely intermediate. "
"Many chemists use qualitative valence bond concepts to rationalize molecular structures and properties, particularly for main group elements. Extension of Pauling\'s valence bond concepts to transition metal compounds dominated by covalent bonding leads to simple prescriptions for determining bond hybridizations and molecular shapes. As a result, transition metal structures can be discussed in the familiar terminology of Lewis structures, lone pairs, hybrid orbitals, hypervalence, and resonance. A primary feature of these prescriptions is the relative impotence of valence p-orbitals in the formation of covalent bonds at transition metals:\xe2\x80\x89 sdn hybridization dominates. This feature is consistent with detailed analyses of high level quantum mechanical computations. Unlike Pauling\'s original treatments of hypervalency, rationalization of empirical structures and high level electronic structure computational results requires consideration of multiple resonance structures. Valence bond theory constitutes a compact and powerful model that accurately explains the often unexpected structures observed for simple metal alkyls and hydrides. "
"This paper contributes to development of a microscopic approach to predicting stable conformations of proteins in solvent. We report results of the first attempt to combine Monte Carlo simulated annealing, a powerful conformational sampling technique, and the reference interaction site model (RISM) theory, a statistical-mechanical treatment for molecular fluids. In solvent the key function is the total energy defined as the sum of the conformational energy and the solvation free energy, and the RISM theory is employed to calculate the latter. Starting from an initial conformation given, our computer program samples many conformations and then finds the conformation with the minimum total energy. Met-enkephalin in the two different solvents, a model water and a simple, repulsive-potential system, are considered. In water the solvation free energy varies greatly from conformation to conformation, while in the simple solvent it remains almost unchanged against conformational changes. In water most of the conformations with larger solvation free energies are strongly rejected, and the number of probable conformations is drastically reduced, which is suggestive that Met-enkephalin is forced to take conformations favored by water far more rapidly than in gas phase and in the simple solvent. The set of stable conformations obtained in water are quite different from those in gas phase and the simple solvent:\xe2\x80\x89 they are characterized by almost fully extended backbone structure with large fluctuations in side-chain structure, which are in qualitatively good agreement with those determined by the recent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments.

"A recently developed quantum mechanical approach devoted to the study of unstable species in solution was applied to isomeric radicals resulting from the addition of hydrogen atoms to thymine. The computational protocol includes either post-Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock or density functional electronic computations, together with simulation of the solvent by a polarizable continuum, and averaging of spectroscopic properties over the most important vibrational motions. Concerning electronic computations, hybrid Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock/density functional models (here B3LYP) provide reliable results both for structural and spectroscopic parameters. In contrast, pure Hartree\xe2\x88\x92Fock or low-order perturbative many-body approaches (here MP2) stand against considerable difficulties in the treatment of open-shell systems. Starting from B3LYP computations, vibrational averaging by the out of plane motions and, to a lower extent, consideration of solvent effects lead to remarkable agreement between the computed hyperfine coupling constants and experimental data.

"The Density Functional Theory B3LYP/6-31G* method is used to provide a detailed understanding of the origins of intra- and intermolecular (solvent) effects on the epoxidation of C\xe2\x88\x92C double bonds by dimethyldioxirane (DMDO) in a model system, 2-methyl-2-butene. We found that the presence of hydrogen bond donor substituents, such as hydroxyl and amino groups, at the allylic position on the olefin leads to substantially decreased activation barriers for epoxidation. This effect is observed exclusively when a hydrogen bond interaction is present between the hydroxyl or amino substituent and the attacking DMDO molecule, and is not caused by inductive electronic effects of the substituents. An even more significant lowering of the activation barrier is seen when DMDO forms a hydrogen bond with methanol (representing a hydrogen bond donor solvent) in the transition state. Solvent polarity, studied using the SCIPCM model, influences the epoxidation barrier to a much smaller degree than do hydrogen bonding interactions. "
"Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometric studies of both cationic water clusters H+(H2O)n, n = 1\xe2\x88\x9270, and anionic water clusters X-(H2O)n, n = 1\xe2\x88\x9230, X = OH, O, with acetone and acetaldehyde are reported. For the cations a sequence of ligand exchange and fragmentation reactions results in \xe2\x80\x9csolvated proton\xe2\x80\x9d complex ion final products. In the anionic OH-(H2O)n clusters, on the other hand, an OH- catalyzed aldol addition of the carbonyl compounds with a true covalent bond formation is observed. The anionic and cationic water clusters thus behave similar to basic and acidic aqueous solutions. "
"The surface organometallic fragment [RhI(P(CH3)3)2(CO)], 1, was prepared by the reaction of trans-[CH3Rh(P(CH3)3)2(CO)] with partially dehydroxylated silica. 1 is attached to the silica surface by a covalent bond to oxygen. The reactions of 1 with organic and inorganic substrates were followed by transmission infrared and solid-state NMR spectroscopies. Ligand exchange reactions were observed when 1 was treated with 13CO and P(CH(CH3)2)3. In the presence of excess PR3 (R is methyl or isopropyl), cationic [Rh(PR3)3CO]+ was formed. In the presence of HCl/DCl, Cl2, CCl3Br, CH3I, and CH2CHCH2Cl, 1 underwent oxidative addition to give Rh(III) surface species, characterized by a shift of the \xce\xbd(CO) modes ca. 100 cm-1 to higher frequency and displacement of the 31P chemical shifts to lower field. In the case of HCl/DCl, \xce\xbd(Rh\xe2\x88\x92H/D) modes were also observed. Oxidative addition of CH3I to 1 occurs without CO insertion, but the formation of acyl complexes was induced by addition of excess P(CH3)3 or CO. The reaction of 1 with CH2CHCH2Cl exhibits biphasic kinetic behavior, implying consecutive elementary reactions of oxidative addition followed by spontaneous CO insertion into the metal\xe2\x88\x92carbon bond. The demonstration of these reactions on an oxide surface supports the idea that, under carefully controlled conditions, surface reactivity can be interpreted by using concepts from organometallic chemistry.

"Complexes of the first-row transition-metal cations (Ti+\xe2\x88\x92Cu+) with one and two ethene molecules are studied by guided ion beam mass spectrometry. Thermalized complexes are formed in a flow tube source and examined by energy-resolved collision-induced dissociation with Xe. The energy dependence of the CID cross sections is analyzed with consideration of multiple collisions, internal energy of the reactants, and lifetime effects. First, D0(M+\xe2\x88\x92C2H4), and second, D0(C2H4M+\xe2\x88\x92C2H4), adiabatic metal ion ethene bond energies, in eV, obtained in this study are 1.51 \xc2\xb1 0.11 for Ti (first bond only), 1.29 \xc2\xb1 0.08 and 1.32 \xc2\xb1 0.14 for V, 0.99 \xc2\xb1 0.11 and 1.12 \xc2\xb1 0.11 for Cr, 0.94 \xc2\xb1 0.12 and 0.91 \xc2\xb1 0.15 for Mn, 1.50 \xc2\xb1 0.11 and 1.57 \xc2\xb1 0.16 for Fe, 1.93 \xc2\xb1 0.09 and 1.58 \xc2\xb1 0.14 for Co, 1.89 \xc2\xb1 0.11 and 1.79 \xc2\xb1 0.15 for Ni, and 1.82 \xc2\xb1 0.14 and 1.80 \xc2\xb1 0.13 for Cu, respectively. These values include corrections for diabatic dissociation in the cases of Fe+(C2H4) and Mn+(C2H4)2, a point that is discussed in detail. Previous work obtained from theory and experiment is then compared with values determined in this study. Periodic trends observed for the mono- and bis-ethene complexes cations are also discussed and compared with the isobaric metal mono- and dicarbonyl cation complexes. "
"By combining the selectivity of high-resolution laser spectroscopy with the specificity of hyperfine interactions in zero-field magnetic-resonance spectroscopy, 13C-containing isotopomers of pentacene have been observed in natural-abundance samples and 1H-containing isotopomers of pentacene in \xe2\x80\x9cfully\xe2\x80\x9d deuterated samples. Molecules containing two 13C nuclei or up to four residual 1H nuclei have been identified. "
"The steric environment of alkanethiolate ligand shells of monolayer-protected gold cluster (MPCs) molecules has been investigated in three ways. First, the SN2 reactivity of \xcf\x89-bromoalkanethiolate-functionalized MPCs with primary amines has been shown to respond to the steric bulk of the incoming nucleophile (rates of n-propylamine> isopropylamine> tert-butylamine), and to the relative chain lengths of \xcf\x89-bromoalkanethiolate and surrounding alkanethiolate chains (rates of C12:C12Br > C12:C8Br > C12:C3Br). Also, unlike 2D-SAMs, \xcf\x89-bromo-functionalized MPCs and primary alkyl halide monomers (RBr) have comparable SN2 reactivities. These results are significant in that little previously was known about the chemical reactivities of the monolayers on MPCs, and in that the poly-functional \xcf\x89-bromoalkanethiolate MPCs are shown to be highly reactive, i.e., as many as 20 SN2 displacements occur per cluster molecule. Second, steric aspects of alkanethiolate monolayers on Au clusters are shown to affect the rate of cyanide-mediated decomposition of the gold core, which slows with increased chain length (up to C10) and steric bulk. Third, solution infrared spectroscopy demonstrates that, in nonpolar solvents, the alkanethiolate ligands on Au MPCs have a disorder approaching that of liquid alkanes. These results support a model of MPC ligand environment of decreasing chain packing density as the distance from the gold core increases, a motif that likely arises from the high curvature of gold nanoparticle surfaces.

"We report NMR and kinetic studies of antibody AZ-28, which was generated against the diaryl-substituted cyclohexanol derivative 3 and catalyzes the oxy-Cope rearrangement of the corresponding hexadiene 1 to aldehyde 2 (Braisted, A. C., Schultz, P. G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994, 116, 2211\xe2\x88\x922212). Conformational studies of free substrate and the antibody\xe2\x88\x92substrate complex using transferred-NOE experiments demonstrate that the antibody binds the substrate in a cyclic conformation, consistent with the chair-like geometry of 3. In contrast, free substrate adopts an extended conformation in solution. In spite of the conformational restriction of the bound substrate revealed by NMR, the temperature dependence of the reaction indicates that the antibody functions primarily by lowering \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7, offsetting a decrease in \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7; the values of \xce\x94H\xe2\xa7\xa7 and \xce\x94S\xe2\xa7\xa7 are 15.4 \xc2\xb1 2.4 kcal/mol and \xe2\x88\x9223 \xc2\xb1 8 cal/mol K, respectively. A secondary kinetic isotope effect (kcatH/kcatD) of 0.61 \xc2\xb1 0.1 was measured for substrate 23 in which both allylic termini are dideuterated, indicating that the chemical rearrangement step is wholly or partially rate limiting under saturating conditions. The magnitude of this secondary isotope effect is consistent with a significant degree of bond formation between C1 and C6 of the substrate in the transition state. These results, together with the recently reported three-dimensional crystal structure for the antibody\xe2\x88\x92hapten 3 complex (Ulrich, H.; Mundroff, E.; Santarsiero, B. D.; Driggers, E. M.; Stevens, R. C.; Schultz, P. G. Nature 1997, 389, 271\xe2\x88\x92275), provide a detailed mechanistic model for this antibody-catalyzed reaction. "
"Selective colorimetric polynucleotide detection based on Au nanoparticle probes which align in a \xe2\x80\x9ctail-to-tail\xe2\x80\x9d fashion onto a target polynucleotide is described. In this new nanoparticle-based detection system, Au particles (\xe2\x88\xbc13 nm diameter), which are capped with 3\xe2\x80\x98- and 5\xe2\x80\x98-(alkanethiol)oligonucleotides, are used to complex a 24-base polynucleotide target. Hybridization of the target with the probes results in the formation of an extended polymeric Au nanoparticle/polynucleotide aggregate, which triggers a red to purple color change in solution. The color change is due to a red shift in the surface plasmon resonance of the Au nanoparticles. The aggregates exhibit characteristic, exceptionally sharp \xe2\x80\x9cmelting transitions\xe2\x80\x9d (monitored at 260 or 700 nm), which allows one to distinguish target sequences that contain one base end mismatches, deletions, or an insertion from the fully complementary target. When test solutions are spotted onto a C18 reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography plate, color differentiation is enhanced and a permanent record of the test is obtained, thereby providing a better method for distinguishing the aforementioned target sequences. Significantly, one-pot colorimetric detection of the target in the presence of four strands with single base imperfections can be accomplished with this new probe system. "
"The binding of neomycin B and related aminoglycoside antibiotics to the prokaryotic ribosomal RNA decoding region has been investigated using a recently developed surface plasmon resonance assay. A number of naturally occurring aminoglycosides containing a neamine or neamine-like substructure bind specifically to a model of the site of the ribosomal decoding region RNA. This recognition event is the basis of the antibacterial activity of this class of compounds. A series of analogs was designed and synthesized to probe the role of neomycin ring IV (2,6-dideoxy-2,6-diamino-\xce\xb2-l-idopyranose). The binding results indicate that the positive charge presented on the idose ring is necessary for specific binding in vitro and cannot be replaced by amines attached via flexible linkers. However, the antibiotic activity (minimum inhibitory concentration) of the analog where ring IV is replaced with a diamine tail is the same as neomycin B in a liquid culture assay against Escherichia coli. "
"This paper describes the solution- and solid-phase synthesis of glycopeptides containing a GlcNAc moiety at different positions and investigates them as substrates for subtilisin-catalyzed glycopeptide condensation, with an aim to develop enzymatic synthesis of complex glycopeptides and glycoproteins. A systematic study was performed to determine the sites at which the protease subtilisin will accept a glycosylated residue in enzymatic peptide ligations. It was found that Fmoc-glycopeptide esters with unprotected side chains can be prepared by solid-phase methodology using the Rink amide resin. Both removal of the side chain protecting groups as well as release from the resin was accomplished by treatment with acid to provide glycopeptide esters of the benzyl type which were used directly as substrates. One such 12 residue peptide ester was used in a subtilisin-catalyzed glycopeptide condensation in a kinetically controlled mode to demonstrate the utility of this approach. "
"The cyclization of H-Ala-Pro-NH2 to the 2,5-dioxopiperazine (DKP) has been studied as a model for the spontaneous cleavage of the peptide bond with concomitant formation of 2,5-dioxopiperazine that can occur at the N-terminus of a polypeptide chain. The reaction involves pre-equilibrium attack of the N-terminal amino group on the carbonyl carbon of the second residue giving a zwitterionic cyclic intermediate, T\xc2\xb1, which is in acid\xe2\x88\x92base equilibrium with various forms characterized by different grades of protonation, T0, T+ and T-. The Br\xc3\xb8nsted plot for the base-catalysis and the pH-rate profile give pKa \xe2\x88\xbc 7 and \xe2\x88\xbc 13 for the equilibria T- + H+ \xe2\x87\x8c T\xc2\xb1 and T- + H+ \xe2\x87\x8c T0, respectively. The reaction is subject to general base and general acid catalysis, acting on different steps. Departure of the amino group from T0 and T- by two parallel routes gives the product. The bifunctional acid catalyst HCO3- strongly increases the reaction rate and at high concentrations causes a change of the rate-limiting step. At high pH, the overall reaction rate is limited by the trans \xe2\x86\x92 cis isomerization of the Ala-Pro peptide bond. "
"The origin of the stability of isolated \xce\xb2-hairpins in aqueous solution is unclear with contrasting opinions as to the relative importance of interstrand hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and conformational preferences, the latter being associated largely with the turn sequence. We have designed an unconstrained 16-residue peptide that we show folds autonomously in water to form a \xce\xb2-hairpin that mimics the two-stranded anti-parallel \xce\xb2-sheet DNA binding motif of the met repressor dimer. The designed peptide, with a type I\xe2\x80\x98 turn (INGK), is shown by CD and a range of NMR parameters to be appreciably folded (\xe2\x89\x8850% at 303 K) in aqueous solution with the predicted alignment of the peptide backbone. We show that the folding transition approximates to a two-state model. The hairpin has a marked temperature-dependent stability, reaching a maximum value at 303 K in water with both lower and higher temperatures destabilizing the folded structure. Van\'t Hoff analysis of H\xce\xb1 chemical shifts, reveals that folding is endothermic and entropy-driven in aqueous solution with a large negative \xce\x94Cp, all of which are reminiscent of proteins with hydrophobic cores, pointing to the hydrophobic effect as the dominant stabilizing interaction in water. We have examined the conformational properties of the C-terminal \xce\xb2-strand (residues 9\xe2\x88\x9216) in isolation and have shown that 3J\xce\xb1N values and backbone intra- and inter-residue H\xce\xb1-NH NOE intensities deviate from those predicted for a random coil, indicating that the \xce\xb2-strand has a natural predisposition to adopt an extended conformation in the absence of secondary structure interactions. A family of \xce\xb2-hairpin structures calculated from 200 (distance and torsion angle) restraints using molecular dynamics shows that the conformation of the hairpin mimics closely the DNA binding face of the met repressor dimer (backbone RMSD between corresponding \xce\xb2-strands of 1.0 \xc2\xb1 0.2 \xc3\x85). "
"Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACDs) are FAD-dependent enzymes that catalyze the conversion of an appropriate fatty acyl-CoA thioester substrate to the corresponding trans-\xce\xb1,\xce\xb2-enoyl-CoA product. Early studies have shown that the dehydrogenation is stereospecific and is initiated by the abstraction of the pro-R \xce\xb1-H, followed by the transfer of the pro-R \xce\xb2-H, as a hydride equivalent, to the bound FAD. However, recent studies of the inactivation of ACDs by a metabolite of hypoglycin A, (methylenecyclopropyl)acetyl-CoA (MCPA-CoA), led to an alternative mechanism in which the reducing equivalent is delivered from the initially formed \xce\xb1-anion to the bound FAD via a single electron transfer process. To further explore the observed mechanistic discrepancy, we have reexamined the inhibitory properties of a closely related MCPA-CoA analogue, spiropentylacetyl-CoA (SPA-CoA), which was previously reported as a tight-binding inhibitor for ACDs. In contrast to early results, our data showed that SPA-CoA is a mechanism-based inhibitor for pig kidney medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and Megasphaera elsdenii short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) and that the inactivation is time-dependent, active-site-directed, and irreversible. More importantly, both (R)- and (S)-SPA-CoA could effectively inactivate MCAD, and the resulting inhibitor\xe2\x88\x92FAD adducts appear to have one of the three-membered rings of the spiropentyl moiety cleaved. Since the inactivation is nonstereospecific with respect to C\xce\xb2\xe2\x88\x92C bond scission, the ring opening of SPA-CoA leading to enzyme inactivation is likely initiated by a spiropentylcarbinyl radical. Such a radical-induced ring fragmentation is expected to be extremely facile and may bypass the chiral discrimination normally imposed by the enzyme. Thus, these results are consistent with our early notion that MCAD is capable of mediating one-electron redox chemistry. Interestingly, it was also found that (R)-SPA-CoA is an irreversible inhibitor for SCAD, while the S-epimer is only a competitive inhibitor for the same enzyme. The selective inhibition exhibited by these compounds against two closely related dehydrogenases is likely a consequence of the distinct steric and electronic demands imposed by the active sites of MCAD and SCAD. Such information is important for the design of novel class-selective inhibitors to control and/or regulate fatty acid metabolism. "
"A four-stage amphoteric redox hydrocarbon (5) containing two phenalenyl units was prepared. X-ray crystallography of 5 reveals a delocalized D2h structure, which is consistent with the presence of only five signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of 5 at \xe2\x88\x9260 \xc2\xb0C. The cyclic voltammogram of 5 exhibits four reversible redox waves with a small numerical sum (E1sum) of first oxidation (E1ox) and reduction (E1red) potentials. Four redox states of 5 were successfully generated from the neutral 5 and were characterized by NMR, ESR, and UV\xe2\x88\x92vis\xe2\x88\x92near-IR spectroscopies and theoretical calculations. These spectral data reveal that phenalenyl units play an important role in the high amphotericity of 5 and the stability of the redox states generated. "
"Addition of lithium cyclopropylacetylide (RLi) to ArCOCF3 mediated by 1(R),2(S)-R2NCH(CH3)CH(Ph)OLi (ROLi; R2N = pyrrolidino) occurs with 50:1 enantioselectivity (Thompson, A. S. et al. Tetrahedron. Lett. 1995, 36, 8937). Low-temperature 6Li and 13C NMR spectroscopies reveal lithium cyclopropylacetylide in THF to be a dimer\xe2\x88\x92tetramer mixture and the lithium alkoxide to be a complex mixture of oligomers. Mixtures of RLi and ROLi in THF afford stoichiometry-dependent mixtures of 3:1, 2:2, and 1:3 mixed tetramers. The dramatic improvements in the stereochemistry of 1,2-additions caused by aging the reaction at ambient temperatures are shown to coincide with unusually slow aggregate equilibrations. ReactIR studies showed that the previously detected requirement for 2 equiv of lithium acetylide per ketone stems from autoinhibition rather than from a proton abstraction of an NH moiety in the substrate. Semiempirical (MNDO) computational studies support a stereochemical model based upon 1,2-addition via a C2 symmetric 2:2 mixed tetramer. "
"The effects of replacing one of the 2-phenylindenyl-type ligands in bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride, (2-PhInd)2ZrCl2 (7), a catalyst precursor for the production of elastomeric polypropylene (ELPP-7), with a cyclopentadienyl-type ligand have been studied. The mixed-ring compounds:\xe2\x80\x89 (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride, Cp*(2-PhInd)ZrCl2, (8), (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)(1-methyl-2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride, Cp*(1-Me-2-PhInd)ZrCl2 (9), and (cyclopentadienyl)(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride, Cp(2-PhInd)ZrCl2 (10), have been synthesized through the reaction of the corresponding lithium indenide with C5R5ZrCl3 (8 and 9:\xe2\x80\x89 R = CH3; 10:\xe2\x80\x89 R = H). Crystal structures have been determined for complexes 8 and 9. The behavior of the catalysts derived from complexes 8, 9, and 10 upon their activation by methylaluminoxane (MAO) for ethylene and propylene polymerization has been studied. Of all mixed-ring catalysts only 8/MAO produces elastomeric polypropylene (ELPP-8) with properties consistent with a stereoblock microstructure. The stereosequence distributions in ELPP-8 determined from 13C NMR spectra are very similar to those in elastomeric polypropylene generated with 7/MAO under comparable conditions. However, the melting points and IR indices of 8/MAO-derived samples are significantly lower than for samples of ELPP-7 with similar isotacticity which may be attributable to shorter isotactic block lengths in ELPP-8. At the same time, comparison of 8/MAO to another metallocene system capable of producing elastomeric polypropylene rac-MeHC(Me4Cp)(Ind)TiCl2/MAO, 1/MAO, described by Chien reveals significant similarities both in the catalyst symmetry and properties of generated polypropylene. The increase of isotacticity of ELPP-8 with propylene pressure similar to the trend observed for ELPP-7 favors the two-state mechanism of stereoblock formation with 8/MAO. "
"Stacking of poly(3-alkylthiophene)s P3RThs and poly(4-alkylthiazole)s P4RTzs has been studied. Light scattering analysis indicates that head-to-tail (HT) type HT-P3HexTh (R = n-C6H13) gives a degree of depolarization (\xcf\x81v) of 0.26 in CHCl3, which reveals that HT-P3HexTh takes a stiff structure even in the good solvent. Addition of CH3OH to CHCl3 solutions of HT-P3HexTh and head-to-head (HH) type HH-P4HepTz (R = n-C7H15) leads to \xcf\x80-stacking of the polymer molecules to form stable colloidal particles. The light scattering analysis of the colloidal solution of HT-P3HexTh in a 2:1 solution of CHCl3 and CH3OH reveals that HT-P3HexTh is aggregated in a parallel style. Results of filtration experiments using membranes with 0.20 and 0.02 \xce\xbcm pores agree with the degree of the aggregation. P3HexThs with irregular structures (P3HexTh (Fe) and P3HexTh (Ni) with HT/HH ratios of about 7/3 and 1/2, respectively) show a weaker trend to aggregate; however, P3HexTh (Fe) is considered to stack in a surface region of a stretched poly(ethylene terephthalate) PET film. A dichroism observed with the stretched PET film indicates that the \xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x80* absorption as well as photoluminescence of the stacked P3HexTh molecules have a transition moment along the direction of the polymer main chain. X-ray diffraction analysis of HT-P3RThs and HH-P4RTzs reveals that they take a face-to-face stacked structure with an end-to-end packing mode, except for HT-P3MeTh (R = Me). HT-P3MeTh forms a face-centered lattice with an interlayer distance of 3.51 \xc3\x85. An alternative copolymer of bithiazole and 4,4\xe2\x80\x98-dibutylbithiazole is packed in an interdigitation mode. At temperatures below 0 \xc2\xb0C, the HT-P3HexTh molecules are \xcf\x80-stacked in CHCl3, and the 1H NMR spectrum shows a severe magnetic effect on the thiophene ring. Solid 13C NMR data are also consistent with the \xcf\x80-stacking. "
"The influence of the Ni deposition mode on the dispersion of Ni2+ precursors was investigated in the preparation of Ni/SiO2 catalysts. The coordination sphere of Ni complexes was mainly studied by XAFS spectroscopy in the initial step (dried samples) and after a vacuum activating treatment at 700 \xc2\xb0C. Four modes of deposition were compared, two leading to supported silicate phases (exchange with ammine ligands and deposition\xe2\x88\x92precipitation) and the other ones using the ethanediamine ligand (exchange and impregnation modes) which produced isolated Ni2+ precursors in electrostatic interaction with the silica support. In this work, EXAFS spectroscopy has been found to be a suitable technique to probe metal\xe2\x88\x92support interactions in the first step of the preparation (dried samples). For samples activated at 700 \xc2\xb0C, this spectroscopy showed the presence of several categories of atoms in the first (oxygen backscatterers) and second (Ni and Si backscatterers) shells. A distribution of long (d \xe2\x89\x88 2.04 \xc3\x85) and short (d \xe2\x89\x88 1.75 \xc3\x85) Ni\xe2\x88\x92O distances was found, corresponding to hexacoordinated (Ni2+6c) and isolated tricoordinated (Ni2+3c) ions, respectively. Modeling of the structure of the Ni2+3c site indicated a distorted site with two short and one long Ni\xe2\x88\x92O distance. The exchange mode with ethanediamine ligand led to isolated Ni2+3c ions which could then be photoreduced into Ni+3c ions with the highest yield. Impregnation with ethanediamine Ni nitrate was also found advantageous as it led after thermal activation at 700 \xc2\xb0C to NiO particles smaller than those produced from impregnation with Ni nitrate and therefore to smaller Ni particles after the subsequent reduction step.

"The terminal chalcogenide complexes Mo(E)(N[R]Ar)3 (R = C(CD3)2CH3, Ar = 3,5-C6H3Me2), where E = O, S, Se, and Te, were prepared by reaction of the three-coordinate complex Mo(N[R]Ar)3 with ONC5H5, S8 or SC2H4, Se, and Te/PEt3 in respective yields of 72, 63, 80, and 73%. The Mo(E)(N[R]Ar)3 complexes were studied by EPR, SQUID, cyclic voltammetry, 2H NMR spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Thermolysis of each Mo(E)(N[R]Ar)3 complex resulted in (formal) tert-butyl radical elimination giving molybdenum(VI) chalcogenide complexes Mo(E)(NAr)(N[R]Ar)2 in yields of 85 (E = O), 84 (E = S), 64 (E = Se) and 40% (E = Te). tert-Butyl elimination kinetics were monitored (2H NMR) over a 62\xe2\x88\x92104 \xc2\xb0C temperature range for Mo(O)(N[R]Ar)3, and from 66 to 93 \xc2\xb0C for Mo(S)(N[R]Ar)3; in both cases, a first-order decay was observed. Treatment of Mo(O)(N[R]Ar)3 with iodine (0.5 equiv) provided [Mo(O)(N[R]Ar)3][I] in 88% yield. The triflate salt [Mo(O)(N[R]Ar)3][O3SCF3] was prepared similarly (71% yield) upon treatment of Mo(O)(N[R]Ar)3 with [Cp2Fe][O3SCF3]. Small-scale experiments monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy established that Mo(N[R]Ar)3 deoxygenates OSMe2, NO2, and SO2 but fails to deoxygenate CO2. Also essentially inert to Mo(N[R]Ar)3 were found to be OPPh3, t-BuNCO, and O2SMe2. Treatment of Mo(N[R]Ar)3 with Se2Ph2 provided Mo(SePh)(N[R]Ar)3 in 72% yield. Treatment of Mo(N[R]Ar)3 with CS2 led to Mo(S)(N[R]Ar)3 and (\xce\xbc-CS)[Mo(N[R]Ar)3]2; the latter was isolated in 42% yield and was the subject of an X-ray diffraction study. Bond dissociation enthalpies D(MoE) for Mo(E)(N[R]Ar)3 (E = O and S) were experimentally determined to be 155.6 \xc2\xb1 1.6 and 104.4 \xc2\xb1 1.2 kcal mol-1, respectively. MoE bond lengths predicted by density functional B3LYP calculations (lanl2dz + dE basis set) for the model complexes Mo(E)(NH2)3 (E = O, S, Se, and Te) were found to compare favorably with the experimentally determined MoE bond lengths. Predicted bond dissociation enthalpies D(MoE) for the hypothetical complexes Mo(E)(NH2)3 are 91 (E = Se) and 71 (E = Te) kcal mol-1. A key finding is that Mo(N[R]Ar)3 selectively splits the nitrous oxide N\xe2\x88\x92N bond to give Mo(N)(N[R]Ar)3 and Mo(NO)(N[R]Ar)3, despite the fact that the oxo complex Mo(O)(N[R]Ar)3 possesses a very strong Mo\xe2\x88\x92O bond and can be prepared by an alternate route.
